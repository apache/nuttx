COPYING
=======

Describes the terms under which Nuttx is distributed. A copy of the BSD-
style licensing is included in this file. In my words -- I believe that you
should free to use NuttX in any environment, private, private, commercial,
open, closed, etc. provided only that you respect the modest copyright
notices as described in license (below), respect Trademarks, and include a
copy of the BSD license.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any
icensing concerns.

Tool Licenses
-------------

Tools under the nuttx/tools directory are not intended for binary
distribution.  You may find other licensing on individual tools in that
directory.  If you intend to redistribute these tools in binary form, please
respect the individual license of each tool as identified in the file header
of the tool source files.

Copyright Date Notation
-----------------------

Copyright information is provided in the header of each file.  This
copyright information includes the name of the copyright holder and the
year(s) in which copyrighted additions to the file were made to the file.
A comma (',') is used to separate years in the list of years.  A hyphen ('-')
is used as a more compact notation when additions were made over several
consecutive years.  So for example, "2007, 2011" would mean that copyrighted
additions were made during the years of 2007 and 2011 whereas "2007-2011"
would indicate copyrighted additions in the years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010,
and 2011.

Copyright Line Continuation
---------------------------

Copy information which exceeds the usable line lengh may be broken and
continued on the following line, such as:

FAT Long File Names
===================

  NOTE:  If CONFIG_FAT_LFN is defined in your NuttX configuration file, then
  there may be some legal, patent issues. The following was extracted from
  the entry "File Allocation Table from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

    "On December 3, 2003 Microsoft announced it would be offering licenses
     for use of its FAT specification and 'associated intellectual property',
     at the cost of a US$0.25 royalty per unit sold, with a $250,000 maximum
     royalty per license agreement.

     o "U.S. Patent 5,745,902 (http://www.google.com/patents?vid=5745902) -
        Method and system for accessing a file using file names having
        different file name formats. ...
     o "U.S. Patent 5,579,517 (http://www.google.com/patents?vid=5579517) -
        Common name space for long and short filenames. ...
     o "U.S. Patent 5,758,352 (http://www.google.com/patents?vid=5758352) -
        Common name space for long and short filenames. ...
     o "U.S. Patent 6,286,013 (http://www.google.com/patents?vid=6286013) -
        Method and system for providing a common name space for long and
        short file names in an operating system. ...

    "Many technical commentators have concluded that these patents only cover
     FAT implementations that include support for long filenames, and that
     removable solid state media and consumer devices only using short names
     would be unaffected. ..."

  This Wikipedia entry has been updated with recent legal decisions in favor
  of Microsoft. Refer to:

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table#Patents

  So you have been forewarned:  Use the long filename at your own risk!

uIP
===

Many lower-level networking components of NuttX derive from uIP which
has a similar BSD style license:

   Copyright (c) 2001-2003, Adam Dunkels.
   All rights reserved.

Rhombus Math Library
====================

The math library used in NuttX derives from the Rhombus OS by Nick Johnson
(with many, many addtions).  The Rhombus OS is/was distributed under the ISC
license.  The ISC licsense is a permissive license that allows people do
anything with your code with proper attribution and without warranty.  The
ISC license is functionally equivalent to the BSD 2-Clause and MIT licenses,
removing some language that is no longer necessary.

IGMP
===

IGMP support, if enabled, adds additional logic by Steve Reynolds:

Certain functions in the NuttX C-library derive from other BSD-compatible
sources:

fs/nfs
======

   NFS:

       California.  All rights reserved.

   and RPC also has:

   The University of Michigan uses a modified BSD license equivalent to

strtod()

dtoa()
======

  If you enable floating point conversions with CONFIG_LIBC_FLOATINGPOINT,
  then some files with an unmodified BSD license will be included.  That
  license is similar to the above (modified) BSD license, but has an
  additional requirement that I state the following:

  "This product includes software developed by the University of
   California, Berkeley and its contributors."

libc/string/lib_vikmemcpy.c
===========================

  If you enable CONFIG_MEMCPY_VIK, then you will build with the optimized
  version of memcpy from Daniel Vik.  Licensing information for that version
  of memcpy() follows:

libs/libc/math
==============

  If you enable CONFIG_LIB, you will build the math library at libc/math.
  This library was taken from the math library developed for the Rhombus
  OS by Nick Johnson (https://github.com/nickbjohnson4224/rhombus).  This
  port was contributed by Darcy Gong.  The Rhombus math library has this
  compatible MIT license:

drivers/video/ov2640
====================

  WARNING:  Some of the information in the data tables in this file came
  from other projects with conflicting licenses:  Linux and ArduCAM.  Those
  both have GPL licenses.  I am not sure if it is proper or not to lift the
  content of those tables and still retain this BSD license.  I am guessing
  so, but I am not a copyright attorney so you should use this driver in
  products at your own risk.
