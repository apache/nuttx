#
# The whole purpose of this is to overcome the limitation of CMake 3.16 to set
# source file properties from directories different from the one defining the
# target where the source file is used. This auxiliary library acts as an
# intermediate target that is usually linked to the system/kernel library
# defined at a higher level.
