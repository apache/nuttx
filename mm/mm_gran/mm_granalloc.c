 * Name: gran_alloc
 *
 * Description:
 *   Allocate memory from the granule heap.
 *
 *   NOTE: The current implementation also restricts the maximum allocation
 *   size to 32 granules.  That restriction could be eliminated with some
 *   additional coding effort.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   handle - The handle previously returned by gran_initialize
 *   size   - The size of the memory region to allocate.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, a non-NULL pointer to the allocated memory is returned;
 *   NULL is returned on failure.
 *
