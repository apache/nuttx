 * Name: mm_shrinkchunk
 *
 * Description:
 *   Reduce the size of the chunk specified by the node structure to the
 *   specified size.  this internal logic is used both from memalign to
 *   dispose of any trailing memory in the aligned allocation and also by
 *   realloc when there is a request to reduce the size of an allocation.
 *
 *   NOTES:
 *     (1) size is the whole chunk size (payload and header)
 *     (2) the caller must hold the MM semaphore.
 *
