 * Name: mm_realloc
 *
 * Description:
 *   If the reallocation is for less space, then:
 *
 *     (1) the current allocation is reduced in size
 *     (2) the remainder at the end of the allocation is returned to the
 *         free list.
 *
 *  If the request is for more space and the current allocation can be
 *  extended, it will be extended by:
 *
 *     (1) Taking the additional space from the following free chunk, or
 *     (2) Taking the additional space from the preceding free chunk.
 *     (3) Or both
 *
 *  If the request is for more space but the current chunk cannot be
 *  extended, then malloc a new buffer, copy the data into the new buffer,
 *  and free the old buffer.
 *
