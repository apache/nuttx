 * Name: mm_heapmember

 * Description:
 *   Check if an address lies in the heap.

 * Parameters:
 *   heap - The heap to check

 *
 * Return Value:
 *   true if the address is a member of the heap.  false if not
 *   not.  If the address is not a member of the heap, then it
 *   must be a member of the user-space heap (unchecked)
