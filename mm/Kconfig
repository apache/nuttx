config MM_DEFAULT_MANAGER
	bool "Default heap manager"
	---help---
		NuttX original memory manager strategy.

config MM_TLSF_MANAGER
	bool "TLSF heap manager"
	---help---
		TLSF memory manager strategy.

config MM_CUSTOMIZE_MANAGER
	bool "Customized heap manager"
	---help---
		Customized memory manager policy. The build will fail
		if the MM heap module not defined by customer.

config MM_KERNEL_HEAP
	bool "Kernel dedicated heap"
	default n if BUILD_FLAT
	default y if BUILD_PROTECTED || BUILD_KERNEL
	---help---
		Under Flat build, this option will enable a separate heap for the kernel.
		By separating the kernel and userspace heaps, the user is granted more
		control over the heaps placement within the memory hierarchy, which is
		specially useful for microcontrollers that provide External RAM.
		Besides segregating the kernel and userspace allocations, this feature
		does not prevent the userspace from accessing the kernel heap.

		As for Protected and Kernel builds, this feature partitions heap memory
		into two parts:
		(1) a protected, kernel-mode heap accessible only by the NuttX kernel,
		and (2) an unprotected user-mode heap for use by applications.
		If you are only interested in protecting the kernel from read access,
		then this option is not necessary. If you wish to secure the kernel data
		as well, then this option should be selected.

		The kernel heap size that is used is provided a a platform-specific
		up_allocate_kheap() interface.  This configuration setting is made
		available to that platform specific code.  However, the
		up_allocate_kheap() interface may chose to ignore this setting if it
		has a more appropriate heap allocation strategy.

config MM_KERNEL_HEAPSIZE
	int "Kernel heap size"
	default 8192
	depends on MM_KERNEL_HEAP
	---help---
		This is the size of the a protected, kernel-mode heap (in bytes).
		The remaining of available memory is given to the unprotected
		user-mode heap.  This value may need to be aligned to units of the
		size of the smallest memory protection region.

config MM_DFAULT_ALIGNMENT
	int "Memory default alignment in bytes"
	default 0
	range 0 64
	---help---
		The memory default alignment in bytes, if this value is 0, the real
		memory default alignment is equal to sizoef(uintptr), if this value
		is not 0, this value must be 2^n and at least sizeof(uintptr).

config MM_SMALL
	bool "Small memory model"
	default n
	depends on MM_DEFAULT_MANAGER
	---help---
		Each memory allocation has a small allocation overhead.  The size
		of that overhead is normally determined by the "width" of the
		address support by the MCU.  MCUs that support 16-bit addressability
		have smaller overhead than devices that support 32-bit addressability.
		However, there are many MCUs that support 32-bit addressability *but*
		have internal SRAM of size less than or equal to 64Kb.  In this case,
		MM_SMALL can be defined so that those MCUs will also benefit
		from the smaller, 16-bit-based allocation overhead.

		WARNING:  This selection will also change the alignment of allocated
		memory.  For example, on ARM memory will have 8-byte alignment by
		default.  If MM_SMALL is selected, then allocated memory will have
		only 4-byte alignment.  This may be important on some platforms where
		64-bit data is in allocated structures and 8-byte alignment is required.

config MM_REGIONS
	int "Number of memory regions"
	default 1
	---help---
		If the architecture includes multiple, non-contiguous regions of
		memory to allocate from, this specifies the number of memory regions
		that the memory manager must handle and enables the API
		mm_addregion(heap, start, end);

config ARCH_HAVE_HEAP2
	bool

config HEAP2_SIZE
	int "Size of the second user heap region"
	default 0
	---help---
		The size of the second heap region.

endif # ARCH_HAVE_HEAP2

config GRAN
	bool "Enable Granule Allocator"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable granule allocator support.  Allocations will be aligned to the
		granule size; allocations will be in units of the granule size.
		Larger granules will give better performance and less overhead but
		more losses of memory due to alignment and quantization waste.

		NOTE: The current implementation also restricts the maximum
		allocation size to 32 granules.  That restriction could be
		eliminated with some additional coding effort.

config GRAN_INTR
	bool "Interrupt level support"
	default n
	depends on GRAN
	---help---
		Normally mutual exclusive access to granule allocator data is assured
		using a semaphore.  If this option is set then, instead, mutual
		exclusion logic will disable interrupts.  While this options is more
		invasive to system performance, it will also support use of the granule
		allocator from interrupt level logic.

config DEBUG_GRAN
	bool "Granule Allocator Debug"
	default n
	depends on GRAN && DEBUG_FEATURES
	---help---
		Just like DEBUG_MM, but only generates output from the gran
		allocation logic.

config MM_PGALLOC
	bool "Enable Page Allocator"
	default n
	depends on ARCH_USE_MMU
	select GRAN
	---help---
		Enable support for a MMU physical page allocator based on the
		granule allocator.

if MM_PGALLOC

config MM_PGSIZE
	int "Page Size"
	default 4096
	---help---
		The MMU page size.  Must be one of {1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, or
		16384}.  This is easily extensible, but only those values are
		currently support.

config DEBUG_PGALLOC
	bool "Page Allocator Debug"
	default n
	depends on DEBUG_FEATURES
	---help---
		Just like DEBUG_MM, but only generates output from the page
		allocation logic.

endif # MM_PGALLOC

config MM_SHM
	bool "Shared memory support"
	default n
	depends on MM_PGALLOC && BUILD_KERNEL
	select ARCH_VMA_MAPPING
	---help---
		Build in support for the shared memory interfaces shmget(), shmat(),
		shmctl(), and shmdt().

config MM_KMAP
	bool "Support for dynamic kernel virtual mappings"
	default n
	depends on MM_PGALLOC && BUILD_KERNEL
	select ARCH_VMA_MAPPING
	---help---
		Build support for dynamically mapping pages from the page pool into
		kernel virtual memory. This includes pages that are already mapped
		for user.

config MM_HEAP_MEMPOOL_THRESHOLD
	int "The size of threshold to avoid using multiple mempool in heap"
	default 0
	---help---
		If the size of the memory requested by the user is less
		than the threshold, the memory will be requested from the
		multiple mempool by default.

config MM_HEAP_MEMPOOL_EXPAND_SIZE
	int "The expand size for each mempool in multiple mempool"
	default 4096
	depends on MM_HEAP_MEMPOOL_THRESHOLD != 0

		pool with insufficient memory in the multi-level memory pool.

	int "The expand size for multiple mempool's dictonary"
	default MM_HEAP_MEMPOOL_EXPAND_SIZE
	depends on MM_HEAP_MEMPOOL_THRESHOLD != 0
	---help---
		This size describes the multiple mempool dictonary expend.

config MM_HEAP_MEMPOOL_CHUNK_SIZE
	int "The multiples pool chunk size"
	default 0
	depends on MM_HEAP_MEMPOOL_THRESHOLD != 0
	---help---
		This size describes the multiple mempool chunk size.

config FS_PROCFS_EXCLUDE_MEMPOOL
	bool "Exclude mempool"
	default DEFAULT_SMALL
	depends on FS_PROCFS

config MM_KASAN
	bool "Kernel Address Sanitizer"
	default n
	---help---
		KASan is a fast compiler-based tool for detecting memory
		bugs in native code. After turn on this option, Please
		add -fsanitize=kernel-address to CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS too.

config MM_KASAN_ALL
	bool "Enable KASan for the entire image"
	depends on MM_KASAN
	default y
	---help---
		This option activates address sanitizer for the entire image.
		If you don't enable this option, you have to explicitly specify
		"-fsanitize=kernel-address" for the files/directories you want
		to check. Enabling this option will get image size increased
		and performance decreased significantly.

		explicitly specify "-fsanitize=undefined" for
		the files/directories you want to check. Enabling this option
		will get image size increased and performance decreased
		significantly.

config MM_UBSAN_OPTION
	string "UBSan options"
	depends on MM_UBSAN
