 * Name: kmm_sbrk
 *
 * Description:
 *    The sbrk() function is used to change the amount of space allocated
 *    for the calling process. The change is made by resetting the process's
 *    break value and allocating the appropriate amount of space.  The amount
 *    of allocated space increases as the break value increases.
 *
 *    The sbrk() function adds 'incr' bytes to the break value and changes
 *    the allocated space accordingly. If incr is negative, the amount of
 *    allocated space is decreased by incr bytes. The current value of the
 *    program break is returned by sbrk(0).
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *    incr - Specifies the number of bytes to add or to remove from the
 *      space allocated for the process.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *    Upon successful completion, sbrk() returns the prior break value.
 *    Otherwise, it returns (void *)-1 and sets errno to indicate the
 *    error:
 *
 *      ENOMEM - The requested change would allocate more space than
 *        allowed under system limits.
 *      EAGAIN - The total amount of system memory available for allocation
 *        to this process is temporarily insufficient. This may occur even
 *        though the space requested was less than the maximum data segment
 *        size.
