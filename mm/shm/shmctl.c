 * Name: shmctl
 *
 * Description:
 *   The shmctl() function provides a variety of shared memory control
 *   operations as specified by cmd. The following values for cmd are
 *   available:
 *
 *     - IPC_STAT
 *       Place the current value of each member of the shmid_ds data
 *       structure associated with shmid into the structure pointed to by
 *       buf.
 *     - IPC_SET
 *       Set the value of the shm_perm.mode member of the shmid_ds data
 *       structure associated with shmid to the corresponding value found
 *       in the structure pointed to by buf.
 *     - IPC_RMID
 *       Remove the shared memory identifier specified by shmid from the
 *       system and destroy the shared memory segment and shmid_ds data
 *       structure associated with it.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   shmid - Shared memory identifier
 *   cmd - shmctl() command
 *   buf - Data associated with the shmctl() command
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Upon successful completion, shmctl() will return 0; otherwise, it will
 *   return -1 and set errno to indicate the error.
 *
 *     - EACCES
 *       The argument cmd is equal to IPC_STAT and the calling process does
 *       not have read permission.
 *     - EINVAL
 *       The value of shmid is not a valid shared memory identifier, or the
 *       value of cmd is not a valid command.
 *     - EPERM
 *       The argument cmd is equal to IPC_RMID or IPC_SET and the effective
 *       user ID of the calling process is not equal to that of a process
 *       with appropriate privileges and it is not equal to the value of
 *       shm_perm.cuid or shm_perm.uid in the data structure associated with
 *       shmid.
 *     - EOVERFLOW
 *       The cmd argument is IPC_STAT and the gid or uid value is too large
 *       to be stored in the structure pointed to by the buf argument.
 *
 * POSIX Deviations:
 *     - IPC_SET.  Does not set the shm_perm.uid or shm_perm.gid
 *       members of the shmid_ds data structure associated with shmid
 *       because user and group IDs are not yet supported by NuttX
 *     - IPC_SET.  Does not restrict the operation to processes with
 *       appropriate privileges or matching user IDs in shmid_ds data
 *       structure associated with shmid.  Again because user IDs and
 *       user/group privileges are are not yet supported by NuttX
 *     - IPC_RMID.  Does not restrict the operation to processes with
 *       appropriate privileges or matching user IDs in shmid_ds data
 *       structure associated with shmid.  Again because user IDs and
 *       user/group privileges are are not yet supported by NuttX

 * Name: shm_destroy
 *
 * Description:
 *   Destroy a memory region.  This function is called:
 *
 *   - On certain conditions when shmget() is not successful in instantiating
 *     the full memory region and we need to clean up and free a table entry.
 *   - When shmctl() is called with cmd == IPC_RMID and there are no
 *     processes attached to the memory region.
 *   - When shmdt() is called after the last process detaches from memory
 *     region after it was previously marked for deletion by shmctl().
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   shmid - Shared memory identifier
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
 *
 * Assumption:
 *   The caller holds either the region table semaphore or else the
 *   semaphore on the particular entry being deleted.
