 * Name: shmdt
 *
 * Description:
 *   The shmdt() function detaches the shared memory segment located at the
 *   address specified by shmaddr from the address space of the calling
 *   process.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   shmid - Shared memory identifier
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Upon successful completion, shmdt() will decrement the value of
 *   shm_nattch in the data structure associated with the shared memory ID
 *   of the attached shared memory segment and return 0.
 *
 *   Otherwise, the shared memory segment will not be detached, shmdt()
 *   will return -1, and errno will be set to indicate the error.
 *
 *   - EINVAL
 *     The value of shmaddr is not the data segment start address of a
 *     shared memory segment.
