/****************************************************************************
 * Name: shm_destroy
 *
 * Description:
 *   Destroy a memory region.  This function is called:
 *
 *   - On certain conditions when shmget() is not successful in instantiating
 *     the full memory region and we need to clean up and free a table entry.
 *   - When shmctl() is called with cmd == IPC_RMID and there are no
 *     processes attached to the memory region.
 *   - When shmdt() is called after the last process detaches from memory
 *     region after it was previously marked for deletion by shmctl().
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   shmid - Shared memory identifier
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
 *
 * Assumption:
 *   The caller holds either the region table semaphore or else the
 *   semaphore on the particular entry being deleted.
