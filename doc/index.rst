NuttX Documentation
===================

NuttX is a real-time operating system (RTOS) with an emphasis on standards compliance and small footprint. Scalable from 8-bit to 32-bit microcontroller environments, the primary governing standards in NuttX are Posix and ANSI standards. Additional standard APIs from Unix and other common RTOSâ€™s (such as VxWorks) are adopted for functionality not available under these standards, or for functionality that is not appropriate for deeply-embedded environments (such as fork()).

.. warning::
   These pages are meant to be an experiment in replacing the `Apache NuttX Documentation <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NUTTX/Nuttx>`_
   with something easier to navigate, extend, and modify.
   This is a work in progress, some formatting issues may still be present and are being worked on. Also, some links may be broken. Please
   refer to :doc:`contributing documentation<contributing/documentation>` to propose fixes/improvements.
