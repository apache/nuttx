 * Name: getrusage
 *
 * Description:
 *   The getrusage() function shall provide measures of the resources used
 *   by the current process or its terminated and waited-for child processes.
 *   If the value of the who argument is RUSAGE_SELF, information shall be
 *   returned about resources used by the current process. If the value of
 *   the who argument is RUSAGE_CHILDREN, information shall be returned
 *   about resources used by the terminated and waited-for children of the
 *   current process. If the child is never waited for (for example, if the
 *   parent has SA_NOCLDWAIT set or sets SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN), the resource
 *   information for the child process is discarded and not included in the
 *   resource information provided by getrusage().
