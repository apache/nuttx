 * Name: gethostname
 *
 * Description:
 *   The gethostname() function will return the standard host name for the
 *   current machine. The namelen argument will specify the size of the
 *   array pointed to by the name argument. The returned name will be null-
 *   terminated, except that if namelen is an insufficient length to hold the
 *   host name, then the returned name will be truncated and it is
 *   unspecified whether the returned name is null-terminated.
 *
 *   Host names are limited to {HOST_NAME_MAX} bytes.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   name - The user-provided buffer to receive the host name.
 *   namelen - The size of the user provided buffer in bytes.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Upon successful completion, 0 will be returned; otherwise, -1 will be
 *   returned.  No errors are defined;  errno variable is not set.
 *
