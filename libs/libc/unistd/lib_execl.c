 * Name: execl
 *
 * Description:
 *   The standard 'exec' family of functions will replace the current process
 *   image with a new process image. The new image will be constructed from a
 *   regular, executable file called the new process image file. There will
 *   be no return from a successful exec, because the calling process image
 *   is overlaid by the new process image.
 *
 *   Simplified 'execl()' and 'execv()' functions are provided by NuttX for
 *   compatibility.  NuttX is a tiny embedded RTOS that does not support
 *   processes and hence the concept of overlaying a tasks process image with
 *   a new process image does not make any sense.  In NuttX, these functions
 *   are wrapper functions that:
 *
 *     1. Call the non-standard binfmt function 'exec', and then
 *     2. exit(0).
 *
 *   Note the inefficiency when 'exec[l|v]()' is called in the normal, two-
 *   step process:  (1) first call vfork() to create a new thread, then (2)
 *   call 'exec[l|v]()' to replace the new thread with a program from the
 *   file system.  Since the new thread will be terminated by the
 *   'exec[l|v]()' call, it really served no purpose other than to support
 *   Unix compatility.
 *
 *   The non-standard binfmt function 'exec()' needs to have (1) a symbol
 *   table that provides the list of symbols exported by the base code, and
 *   (2) the number of symbols in that table.  This information is currently
 *   provided to 'exec()' from 'exec[l|v]()' via NuttX configuration setting:
 *
 *     CONFIG_LIBC_EXECFUNCS         : Enable exec[l|v] support
 *     CONFIG_EXECFUNCS_SYMTAB_ARRAY : Symbol table name used by exec[l|v]
 *     CONFIG_EXECFUNCS_NSYMBOLS_VAR : Variable holding number of symbols in
 *                                     the table
 *
 *   As a result of the above, the current implementations of 'execl()' and
 *   'execv()' suffer from some incompatibilities that may or may not be
 *   addressed in a future version of NuttX.  Other than just being an
 *   inefficient use of MCU resource, the most serious of these is that
 *   the exec'ed task will not have the same task ID as the vfork'ed
 *   function.  So the parent function cannot know the ID of the exec'ed
 *   task.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   path - The path to the program to be executed.  If CONFIG_LIB_ENVPATH
 *     is defined in the configuration, then this may be a relative path
 *     from the current working directory.  Otherwise, path must be the
 *     absolute path to the program.
 *   ... - A list of the string arguments to be recevied by the
 *     program.  Zero indicates the end of the list.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This function does not return on success.  On failure, it will return
 *   -1 (ERROR) and will set the 'errno' value appropriately.
