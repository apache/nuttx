 * Description:
 *   pipe() creates a pair of file descriptors, pointing to a pipe inode,

 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   fd[2] - The user provided array in which to catch the pipe file
 *   descriptors
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   0 is returned on success; otherwise, -1 is returned with errno set
 *   appropriately.
