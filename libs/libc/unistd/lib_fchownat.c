 * Name: fchownat
 *
 * Description:
 *   The fchownat() system call operates in exactly the same way as chown(),
 *   except for  the  differences described here.
 *
 *   If the pathname given in pathname is relative, then it is interpreted
 *   relative to the directory referred to by the file descriptor dirfd
 *   (rather than relative to the current working directory of the calling
 *    process)
 *
 *   If pathname is relative and dirfd is the special value AT_FDCWD, then
 *   pathname is interpreted relative to the current working directory of
 *   the calling process (like chown()).
 *
 *   If pathname is absolute, then dirfd is ignored.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   dirfd - The file descriptor of directory.
 *   path  - A pointer to the path.
 *   owner - The owner to set.
 *   group - The group to set.
 *   flags - Ignored.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Return zero on success, or -1 if an error occurred (in which case,
 *   errno is set appropriately).
 *
