 * Name: daemon
 *
 * Description:
 *   The daemon() function is for programs wishing to detach themselves from
 *   the controlling terminal and run in the background as system daemons.
 *
 *   NOTE: daemon() is a non-standard GNU C library interface (based on a
 *   BSD interface of the same way which behaves slightly differently).
 *   The interfaces defined at OpenGroup.org are the interfaces that govern
 *   NuttX.  deamon() is only described in the Linux man pages like:
 *   http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/daemon.3.html
 *
 * Limitations:
 *   NuttX does not implement controlling terminals so the primary purpose
 *   of this interface cannot be supported.  Additional operations controlled
 *   by input parameters are supported, however.
 *
 *   It is not possible to support a true Linux daemon() helper function
 *   because it is designed to work only in the Linux environment and cannot
 *   be translated to NuttX.  The above mentioned web page states:
 *
 *     (This function forks, and if the fork(2) succeeds, the parent calls
 *     _exit(2), so that further errors are seen by the child only.)  On
 *
 *   So the basic operation of the NuttX daemon() is different.  The GNU C
 *   library daemon() begins will logic like:
 *
 *     switch (fork())
 *       {
 *         case -1:
 *           return -1;
 *         case 0:
 *           break;
 *         default:
 *           exit(0);
 *       }
 *
 *    This implementation begins essentially 'pretending' that we forked
 *    and that the fork was successful and that we are the child of the
 *    fork.
 *
 *    REVISIT:  Ideally we should remove the parent information from the
 *    the new daemon's group data structure.  That would have a similar
 *    effect to the above fork() operation.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   nochdir - If nochdir is zero, daemon() changes the process's current
 *     working directory to the root directory ("/"); otherwise, the current
 *     working  directory is left unchanged.
 *   noclose - If noclose is zero, daemon() redirects standard input,
 *     standard output and standard error to /dev/null; otherwise, no changes
 *     are made to these file descriptors.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   0 is returned on success; otherwise, -1 is returned with errno set
 *   appropriately.
