 * Name: getopt
 *
 * Description:
 *   getopt() parses command-line arguments.  Its arguments argc and argv
 *   are the argument count and array as passed to the main() function on
 *   program invocation.  An element of argv that starts with '-' is an
 *   option element. The characters of this element (aside from the initial
 *   '-') are option characters. If getopt() is called repeatedly, it
 *   returns successively each of the option characters from each of the
 *   option elements.
 *
 *   If getopt() finds another option character, it returns that character,
 *   updating the external variable optind and a static variable nextchar so
 *   that the next call to getopt() can resume the scan with the following
 *   option character or argv-element.
 *
 *   If there are no more option characters, getopt() returns -1. Then optind
 *   is the index in argv of the first argv-element that is not an option.
 *
 *   The 'optstring' argument is a string containing the legitimate option
 *   characters. If such a character is followed by a colon, this indicates
 *   that the option requires an argument.  If an argument is required for an
 *   option so getopt() places a pointer to the following text in the same
 *   argv-element, or the text of the following argv-element, in optarg.
 *
 *   NOTES:
 *   1. opterr is not supported and this implementation of getopt() never
 *      printfs error messages.
 *   2. getopt is NOT threadsafe!
 *   3. This version of getopt() does not reset global variables until
 *      -1 is returned.  As a result, your command line parsing loops
 *      must call getopt() repeatedly and continue to parse if other
 *      errors are returned ('?' or ':') until getopt() finally returns -1.
 *     (You can also set optind to -1 to force a reset).
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   If an option was successfully found, then getopt() returns the option
 *   character. If all command-line options have been parsed, then getopt()
 *   returns -1.  If getopt() encounters an option character that was not
 *   in optstring, then '?' is returned. If getopt() encounters an option
 *   with a missing argument, then the return value depends on the first
 *   character in optstring: if it is ':', then ':' is returned; otherwise
 *   '?' is returned.
