 * Name: setlogmask
 *
 * Description:
 *   The setlogmask() function sets the logmask and returns the previous
 *   mask. If the mask argument is 0, the current logmask is not modified.
 *
 *   The SYSLOG priorities are: LOG_EMERG, LOG_ALERT, LOG_CRIT, LOG_ERR,
 *   LOG_WARNING, LOG_NOTICE, LOG_INFO, and LOG_DEBUG.  The bit corresponding
 *   to a priority p is LOG_MASK(p); LOG_UPTO(p) provides the mask of all
 *   priorities in the above list up to and including p.
 *
 *   Per OpenGroup.org "If the maskpri argument is 0, the current log mask
 *   is not modified."  In this implementation, the value zero is permitted
 *   in order to disable all syslog levels.
 *
 * REVISIT: Per POSIX the syslog mask should be a per-process value but in
 * NuttX, the scope of the mask is dependent on the nature of the build:
 *
 *   Flat Build:  There is one, global SYSLOG mask that controls all output.
 *   Protected Build:  There are two SYSLOG masks.  One within the kernel
 *     that controls only kernel output.  And one in user-space that controls
 *     only user SYSLOG output.
 *   Kernel Build:  The kernel build is compliant with the POSIX requirement:
 *     There will be one mask for each user process, controlling the SYSLOG
 *     output only form that process.  There will be a separate mask
 *     accessible only in the kernel code to control kernel SYSLOG output.
