 * Name: gethostbyname
 *
 * Description:
 *   The gethostbyname() function returns a structure of type hostent for
 *   the given host name. Here name is either a hostname, or an IPv4 address
 *   in standard dot notation (as for inet_addr(3)), or an IPv6 address in
 *   colon (and possibly dot) notation.
 *
 *   If name is an IPv4 or IPv6 address, no lookup is performed and
 *   gethostbyname_r() simply copies name into the h_name field
 *   and its struct in_addr equivalent into the h_addr_list[0] field of the
 *   returned hostent structure.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   name - The name of the host to find.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Upon successful completion, this function will return a pointer to a
 *   hostent structure if the requested entry was found, and a null pointer
 *   if the end of the database was reached or the requested entry was not
 *   found.
 *
 *   Upon unsuccessful completion, gethostbyname() will set h_errno to
 *   indicate the error
 *
