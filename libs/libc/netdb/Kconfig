config LIBC_GAISTRERROR
	bool "Enable gai_strerror"
	default n
	---help---
		The gai_strerror() function shall return a text string describing an error
		value for the getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo(). But it can also require a lot
		of memory. If this option is not selected, gai_strerror() will still exist in
		the build but it will not decode error values.

config NETDB_BUFSIZE

config NETDB_MAX_IPADDR
	int "Max number of IP addresses per host"
	default 2 if NET_IPv4 && NET_IPv6
	default 1
	---help---
		This setting determines the maximum number of IP addresses
		stored to the name resolution cache for a given host.

menuconfig NETDB_HOSTFILE
	bool "Network host file support"
	default n
	select LIBC_NETDB
	---help---
		Enable network host table look ups via gethostbyname() and
		gethostbyaddr().

config NETDB_DNSCLIENT_ENTRIES
	int "Number of DNS resolver entries"
	default 0 if DEFAULT_SMALL
	default 8 if !DEFAULT_SMALL
	range 0 255
	---help---
		Number of cached DNS resolver entries.  Default: 8.  Zero disables
		all cached name resolutions.

		Disabling the DNS cache means that each access call to
		gethostbyname() will result in a new DNS network query.  If
		CONFIG_NETDB_DNSCLIENT_ENTRIES is non-zero, then entries will be
		cached and if the name mapping can be found in that cache, the
		network query can be avoid.  Of course, this is only useful if you
		query the same name often and if the IP address of the name is
		stable.  If the IP address can change, then caching DNS address
		might have undesirable side-effects (see help for
		CONFIG_NETDB_DNSCLIENT_LIFESEC).

config NETDB_DNSCLIENT_NAMESIZE
	int "Max size of a cached hostname"
	default 32
	---help---
		The size of a hostname string in the DNS resolver cache is fixed.
		This setting provides the maximum size of a hostname.  Names longer
		than this will be aliased!  Default: 32

config NETDB_DNSCLIENT_LIFESEC
	int "Life of a DNS cache entry (seconds)"
	default 3600
	---help---
		Cached entries in the name resolution cache older than this will not
		be used.  Default: 1 hour.  Zero means that entries will not expire.

		Small values of CONFIG_NETDB_DNSCLIENT_LIFESEC may result in more
		network DNS queries; larger values can make a host unreachable for
		the entire duration of the timeout value.  This might happen, for
		example, if the remote host was assigned a different IP address by
		a DHCP server.

config NETDB_DNSCLIENT_MAXRESPONSE
	int "Max response size"
	default NETDB_BUFSIZE
	---help---
		This setting determines the maximum size of response message that
		can be received by the DNS resolver.  The default used to be 96,
		which might be enough if you have a control on the DNS servers.
		It may need to be larger on enterprise networks.

config NETDB_DNSCLIENT_RECV_TIMEOUT
	int "DNS receive timeout"
	default 30
	---help---
		This is the timeout value when DNS receives response after
		dns_send_query, unit: seconds

config NETDB_DNSCLIENT_RETRIES
	int "Number of retries for DNS request"
	default 3
	---help---
		This setting determines how many times resolver retries request
		until failing.

config NETDB_RESOLVCONF
	bool "DNS resolver file support"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable DNS server look ups in resolver file like /etc/resolv.conf.

config NETDB_RESOLVCONF_NONSTDPORT
	bool "Non-standard port support"
	default n
	---help---
		By default, the resolv.conf file will hold only records like:

			nameserver xx.xx.xx.xx
			nameserver xxxx:::::::xxxx

		The default port of 53 is always assumed.

		If this option is selected, then OpenBSD style resolv.conf files
		will be supported.  This adds logic for a bracket port notation
		like:

			nameserver [xx.xx.xx.xx]:ppppp
			nameserver [xxxx:::::::xxxx]:ppppp
