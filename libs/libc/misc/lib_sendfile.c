 * Name: sendfile / lib_sendfile
 *
 * Description:
 *   sendfile() copies data between one file descriptor and another.
 *   sendfile() basically just wraps a sequence of reads() and writes()
 *   to perform a copy.  It serves a purpose in systems where there is
 *   a penalty for copies to between user and kernal space, but really
 *   nothing in NuttX but provide some Linux compatible (and adding
 *   another 'almost standard' interface).
 *
 *   NOTE: This interface is *not* specified in POSIX.1-2001, or other
 *   standards.  The implementation here is very similar to the Linux
 *   sendfile interface.  Other UNIX systems implement sendfile() with
 *   different semantics and prototypes.  sendfile() should not be used
 *   in portable programs.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   infd   - A file (or socket) descriptor opened for reading
 *   outfd  - A descriptor opened for writing.
 *   offset - If 'offset' is not NULL, then it points to a variable
 *            holding the file offset from which sendfile() will start
 *            reading data from 'infd'.  When sendfile() returns, this
 *            variable will be set to the offset of the byte following
 *            the last byte that was read.  If 'offset' is not NULL,
 *            then sendfile() does not modify the current file offset of
 *            'infd'; otherwise the current file offset is adjusted to
 *            reflect the number of bytes read from 'infd.'
 *
 *            If 'offset' is NULL, then data will be read from 'infd'
 *            starting at the current file offset, and the file offset
 *            will be updated by the call.
 *   count -  The number of bytes to copy between the file descriptors.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   If the transfer was successful, the number of bytes written to outfd is
 *   returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.
 *   There error values are those returned by read() or write() plus:
 *
 *   EINVAL - Bad input parameters.
 *   ENOMEM - Could not allocated an I/O buffer
