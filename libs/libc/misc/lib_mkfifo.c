 * Name: mkfifo
 *
 * Description:
 *   mkfifo() makes a FIFO device driver file with name 'pathname.'  Unlike
 *   Linux, a NuttX FIFO is not a special file type but simply a device
 *   driver instance.  'mode' specifies the FIFO's permissions.
 *
 *   Once the FIFO has been created by mkfifo(), any thread can open it for
 *   reading or writing, in the same way as an ordinary file. However, it
 *   must have been opened from both reading and writing before input or
 *   output can be performed.  This FIFO implementation will block all
 *   attempts to open a FIFO read-only until at least one thread has opened
 *   the FIFO for  writing.
 *
 *   If all threads that write to the FIFO have closed, subsequent calls to
 *   read() on the FIFO will return 0 (end-of-file).
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   pathname - The full path to the FIFO instance to attach to or to create
 *     (if not already created).
 *   mode - Ignored for now
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   0 is returned on success; otherwise, -1 is returned with errno set
 *   appropriately.
 *
