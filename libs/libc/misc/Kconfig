config LIBC_CRC64_FAST
	bool "Fast CRC64"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable the CRC64 lookup table to compute the CRC64 faster.

config LIBC_CRC32_SLOW
	bool "CRC32 not use table to decrease rodata size"
	default n
	---help---
		Optional disable the CRC32 lookup table to decrease rodata usage.

config LIBC_KBDCODEC
	bool "Keyboard CODEC"
	default n
	---help---
		In NuttX, a keyboard/keypad driver is simply a character driver that
		may have an (optional) encoding/decoding layer on the data returned
		by the character driver. A keyboard may return simple text data
		(alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation) or control characters
		(enter, control-C, etc.).  However, in addition, most keyboards
		support actions that cannot be represented as text data. Such
		actions include things like cursor controls (home, up arrow,
		page down, etc.), editing functions (insert, delete, etc.), volume
		controls, (mute, volume up, etc.) and other special functions.
		Some special encoding may be required to multiplex these two classes
		of data.

		This option enables the functions that implement the encoding and
		decoding of keyboard data.  These are the interfaces prototyped in
		include/nuttx/input/kbd_codec.h.  While not correctly a part of
		the C library, it is included here because the decoding side of this
		interface must be accessible by end user programs.

config LIBC_SLCDCODEC
	bool "Segment LCD CODEC"
	default n
	---help---
		In NuttX, a character-oriented, segment LCD (SLCD) driver is simply
		a character device that may have an (optional) encoding/decoding
		layer on the data provided to the SLCD driver.  The application may
		provide simple text data (alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation) or
		control characters (enter, control-C, etc.).  However, in addition,
		most SLCDs support actions that cannot be represented as text data.
		Such actions include things like cursor controls (home, up arrow,
		page down, etc.) and other special functions (e.g., blinking).  Some
		special encoding may be required to multiplex these two classes of
		data.

		This option enables the functions that implement the encoding and
		decoding of SLCD data.  These are the interfaces prototyped in
		include/nuttx/lcd/slcd_codec.h.  While not correctly a part of the C
		library, it is included here because the encoding side of this
		interface must be accessible by end user programs.

config LIBC_ENVPATH
	bool "Support PATH Environment Variable"
	default n
	depends on !DISABLE_ENVIRON
	---help---
		Use the contents of the common environment variable to locate executable
		or library files.  Default: n

config FDSAN
	bool "Enable Fdsan"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable the fdsan support

config FDCHECK
	bool "Enable fdcheck"
	default n
	depends on SCHED_HAVE_PARENT
	---help---
		Enable the fdcheck support

config LIBC_FTOK_VFS_PATH
	string "Relative path to ftok storage"
	default "/var/ftok"
	---help---
		The relative path to where ftok will exist in the root namespace.

config LIBC_UNAME_DISABLE_TIMESTAMP
	bool "Disable uname timestamp support"
	default n
	---help---
		Currently uname command will print the timestamp
		when the binary was built, and it generates an issue
		because two identical built binaries will have differents
		hashes/CRC.

choice
	prompt "Select memfd implementation"

config LIBC_MEMFD_SHMFS
	bool "memfd base on shmfs"
	depends on FS_SHMFS

config LIBC_MEMFD_TMPFS
	bool "memfd base on tmpfs"
	depends on FS_TMPFS

config LIBC_MEMFD_ERROR
	bool "memfd return error"

endchoice

config LIBC_MEM_FD_VFS_PATH
	string "Relative path to memfd storage"
	default "memfd"
	depends on !LIBC_MEMFD_ERROR
	---help---
		The relative path to where memfd will exist in the tmpfs namespace.

config LIBC_TEMPBUFFER
	bool "Enable global temp buffer"
	default !DEFAULT_SMALL
	---help---
		Enable this option to enable the global temp buffer, otherwise use stack variables via alloca().
		If the current platform does not require a large TEMP_MAX_SIZE size support and toolchain supports alloca(),
		we could turn off this option to improve performance.

if LIBC_TEMPBUFFER

config LIBC_MAX_TEMPBUFFER
	int "Maximum size of a temporary file temp buffer array"
	range 0 32
	default 2
	---help---
		This value is the maximum size of the buffer that will hold the full line.

config LIBC_TEMPBUFFER_MALLOC
	bool "Enable malloc tempbuffer"
	default y
	---help---
		Enable malloc temp buffer from the heap when tempbuffer is insufficient.

endif # LIBC_TEMPBUFFER

config LIBC_BACKTRACE_BUFFSIZE
	int "The size of backtrace record buffer"
	depends on SCHED_BACKTRACE
	default 0
	---help---
		The size of the backtrace buffer.

config LIBC_BACKTRACE_DEPTH
	int "The depth of backtrace"
	depends on LIBC_BACKTRACE_BUFFSIZE > 0
	default 8
	---help---
		The depth of the backtrace buffer.

config LIBC_MUTEX_BACKTRACE
	int "The depth of mutex backtrace"
	default 0
	---help---
		Config the depth of backtrace, dumping the backtrace of thread which
		last acquired the mutex. Disable mutex backtrace by 0.
