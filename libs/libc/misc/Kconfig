config LIBC_CRC64_FAST
	bool "Fast CRC64"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable the CRC64 lookup table to compute the CRC64 faster.

config LIBC_KBDCODEC
	bool "Keyboard CODEC"
	default n
	---help---
		In NuttX, a keyboard/keypad driver is simply a character driver that
		may have an (optional) encoding/decoding layer on the data returned
		by the character driver. A keyboard may return simple text data
		(alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation) or control characters
		(enter, control-C, etc.).  However, in addition, most keyboards
		support actions that cannot be represented as text data. Such
		actions include things like cursor controls (home, up arrow,
		page down, etc.), editing functions (insert, delete, etc.), volume
		controls, (mute, volume up, etc.) and other special functions.
		Some special encoding may be required to multiplex these two classes
		of data.

		This option enables the functions that implement the encoding and
		decoding of keyboard data.  These are the interfaces prototyped in
		include/nuttx/input/kbd_codec.h.  While not correctly a part of
		the C library, it is included here because the decoding side of this
		interface must be accessible by end user programs.

config LIBC_SLCDCODEC
	bool "Segment LCD CODEC"
	default n
	---help---
		In NuttX, a character-oriented, segment LCD (SLCD) driver is simply
		a character device that may have an (optional) encoding/decoding
		layer on the data provided to the SLCD driver.  The application may
		provide simple text data (alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation) or
		control characters (enter, control-C, etc.).  However, in addition,
		most SLCDs support actions that cannot be represented as text data.
		Such actions include things like cursor controls (home, up arrow,
		page down, etc.) and other special functions (e.g., blinking).  Some
		special encoding may be required to multiplex these two classes of
		data.

		This option enables the functions that implement the encoding and
		decoding of SLCD data.  These are the interfaces prototyped in
		include/nuttx/lcd/slcd_codec.h.  While not correctly a part of the C
		library, it is included here because the encoding side of this
		interface must be accessible by end user programs.

config LIBC_ENVPATH
	bool "Support PATH Environment Variable"
	default n
	depends on !DISABLE_ENVIRON
	---help---
		Use the contents of the common environment variable to locate executable
		or library files.  Default: n

config LIBC_ERR
	bool "Support err() verr() verrx() warn() vwarn() vwarnx()"
	default y
	---help---
		Support err() verr() verrx() warn() vwarn() vwarnx().  Default: y
