 * Name: ioctl
 *
 * Description:
 *   Perform device specific operations.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   fd       File/socket descriptor of device
 *   req      The ioctl command
 *   ...      A third argument of type unsigned long is expected
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   >=0 on success (positive non-zero values are cmd-specific)
 *   -1 on failure with errno set properly:
 *
 *   EBADF
 *     'fd' is not a valid descriptor.
 *   EFAULT
 *     'arg' references an inaccessible memory area.
 *   EINVAL
 *     'cmd' or 'arg' is not valid.
 *   ENOTTY
 *     'fd' is not associated with a character special device.
 *   ENOTTY
 *      The specified request does not apply to the kind of object that the
 *      descriptor 'fd' references.

   * REVISIT:  This could be the cause of the crash down the road if the
   * actual size of the argument is not sizeof(unsigned long).
   * Most small integers will be promoted to 'int'.  ARM should pass the
   * following test with all three types having sizeof(type) == 4 bytes.
   * 'float' should also be tested.  But 'long long' and 'double' are out of
   * the question!  Don't try to pass them.
   *
   * And what will happen if no third argument is passed?  In most cases,
   * this should just result in a garbage value for arg.  But you may
   * discover cases where something worse happens!
