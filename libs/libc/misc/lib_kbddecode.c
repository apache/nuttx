 * Name: kbd_reget
 *
 * Description:
 *   We have unused characters from the last, unsuccessful decode attempt.
 *   Return one of these instead of the new character from the stream.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   stream - An instance of lib_instream_s to do the low-level get
 *     operation.
 *   pch - The location character to save the returned value.  This may be
 *     either a normal, character code or a special command from enum
 *     kbd_keycode_e
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   KBD_PRESS - Indicates the successful receipt of norma keyboard data.

 * Name: kbd_decode
 *
 * Description:
 *   Get one byte of data or special command from the driver provided input
 *   buffer.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   stream - An instance of lib_instream_s to do the low-level get
 *     operation.
 *   pch - The location to save the returned value.  This may be
 *     either a normal, character code or a special command from enum
 *     kbd_keycode_e
 *   state - A user provided buffer to support parsing.  This structure
 *     should be cleared the first time that kbd_decode is called.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *
 *  KBD_PRESS  - Indicates the successful receipt of normal, keyboard data.
 *    This corresponds to a keypress event.  The returned value in pch is a
 *    simple byte of text or control data corresponding to the pressed key.
 *  KBD_RELEASE - Indicates a key release event.  The returned value in pch
 *    is the byte of text or control data corresponding to the released key.
 *  KBD_SPECPRESS - Indicates the successful receipt of a special keyboard
 *    command. The returned value in pch is a value from enum kbd_getstate_s.
 *  KBD_SPECREL - Indicates a special key release event.  The returned value
 *    in pch is a value from enum kbd_getstate_s.
 *  EOF - An error has getting the next character (reported by the stream).
 *    Normally indicates the end of file.
