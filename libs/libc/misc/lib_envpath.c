/****************************************************************************
 * Name: envpath_init
 *
 * Description:
 *   Initialize for the traversal of each value in the PATH variable.  The
 *   usage is sequence is as follows:
 *
 *   1) Call envpath_init() to initialize for the traversal.  envpath_init()
 *      will return an opaque handle that can then be provided to
 *      envpath_next() and envpath_release().
 *   2) Call envpath_next() repeatedly to examine every file that lies
 *      in the directories of the PATH variable
 *   3) Call envpath_release() to free resources set aside by envpath_init().
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, envpath_init() return a non-NULL, opaque handle that may
 *   subsequently be used in calls to envpath_next() and envpath_release().
 *   On error, a NULL handle value will be returned.  The most likely cause
 *   of an error would be that there is no value associated with the PATH
 *   variable.

 * Description:

 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   handle - The handle value returned by envpath_init
 *   relpath - The relative path to the file to be found.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, a non-NULL pointer to a null-terminated string is provided.
 *   This is the full path to a file that exists in the file system.  This
 *   function will verify that the file exists (but will not verify that it
 *   is marked envcutable).
 *
 *   NOTE: The string pointer return in the success case points to allocated
 *   memory.  This memory must be freed by the called by calling lib_free().
 *
 *   NULL is returned if no path is found to any file with the provided
 *   'relpath' from any absolute path in the PATH variable.  In this case,
 *   there is no point in calling envpath_next() further; envpath_release()
 *   must be called to release resources set aside by expath_init().
