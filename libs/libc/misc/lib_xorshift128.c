 * Name: xorshift128
 *
 * Description:
 *   Generate one 32-bit pseudo-random number.
 *
 *   NOTE: Because the PRNG state is passed as a parameter, this function is
 *   fully re-entrant and may be called from an interrupt handler.
 *
 *   The downside to this is that users of the PRNG might not get as much
 *   entropy as if it were a common state structure.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   state - The current XorShift128 state.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   The generated pseudo-random number
 *
