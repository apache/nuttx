 * Name: pthread_spin_init
 *
 * Description:
 *   The pthread_spin_init() function will allocate any resources required
 *   to use the spin lock referenced by lock and initialize the lock to an
 *   unlocked state.
 *
 *   The results are undefined if pthread_spin_init() is called specifying
 *   an already initialized spin lock. The results are undefined if a spin
 *   lock is used without first being initialized.
 *
 *   If the pthread_spin_init() function fails, the lock is not initialized
 *   and the contents of lock are undefined.
 *
 *   Only the object referenced by lock may be used for performing
 *   synchronization.  The result of referring to copies of that object in
 *   calls to pthread_spin_destroy(), pthread_spin_lock(),
 *   pthread_spin_trylock(), or pthread_spin_unlock() is undefined.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   lock - A reference to the spinlock object to be initialized.
 *   pshared - Unused
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned if a valid lock value is provided.
 *
 * POSIX Compatibility:
 *   Not supported: "If the Thread Process-Shared Synchronization option is
 *   supported and the value of pshared is PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED, the
 *   implementation shall permit the spin lock to be operated upon by any
 *   thread that has access to the memory where the spin lock is allocated,
 *   even if it is allocated in memory that is shared by multiple
 *   processes."

 * Description:

 * Name: pthread_spin_lock

 * Description:

 *
 *   If it is determined the value specified by the lock argument to
 *   pthread_spin_lock() refers to a spin lock object for which the calling
 *   thread already holds the lock, it is recommended that the function will
 *   fail and report an EDEADLK error.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   lock - A reference to the spinlock object to lock.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero is returned if the lock was successfully acquired.  Otherwise one
 *   of the following errno values are returned:
 *
 *   EINVAL    - 'lock' does not refer to a valid spinlock object
 *   EDEADLOCK - The caller already holds the spinlock
