 * Name: pthread_cond_destroy
 *
 * Description:
 *   A thread can delete condition variables.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK (0) on success; a (non-negated) errno value on failure. The errno
 *   variable is not set. EBUSY is returned when the implementation has
 *   detected an attempt to destroy the object referenced by cond while
 *   it is referenced. EINVAL is returned when cond is invalid.
 *
 * Assumptions:
