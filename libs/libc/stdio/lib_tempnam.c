 * Name: tempnam
 *
 * Description:
 *   The tempnam() function generates a pathname that may be used for a
 *   temporary file.
 *
 *   The tempnam() function allows the user to control the choice of a
 *   directory. The dir argument points to the name of the directory in which
 *   the file is to be created. If dir is a null pointer or points to a
 *   string which is not a name for an appropriate directory, the path prefix
 *   defined as P_tmpdir in the <stdio.h> header will be used. If that
 *   directory is not accessible, an implementation-defined directory may be
 *   used.
 *
 *   Many applications prefer their temporary files to have certain initial
 *   letter sequences in their names. The pfx argument should be used for
 *   this. This argument may be a null pointer or point to a string of up
 *   to five bytes to be used as the beginning of the filename.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Upon successful completion, tempnam() will allocate space for a string
 *   put the generated pathname in that space, and return a pointer to it.
 *   The pointer will be suitable for use in a subsequent call to free().
 *   Otherwise, it will return a null pointer and set errno to indicate the
 *   error.
 *
 *   The tempnam() function will fail if:
 *     ENOMEM - Insufficient storage space is available.
