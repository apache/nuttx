 * Name: getdelim()
 *
 * Description:
 *   The getdelim() function will read from stream until it encounters a
 *   character matching the delimiter character.  The delimiter argument
 *   is an int, the value of which the application will ensure is a
 *   character representable as an unsigned char of equal value that
 *   terminates the read process. If the delimiter argument has any other
 *   value, the behavior is undefined.
 *
 *   The application will ensure that *lineptr is a valid argument that
 *   could be passed to the free() function.  If *n is non-zero, the
 *   application will ensure that *lineptr either points to an object of
 *   size at least *n bytes, or is a null pointer.
 *
 *   If *lineptr is a null pointer or if the object pointed to by
 *   *lineptr is of insufficient size, an object will be allocated as if
 *   by malloc() or the object will be reallocated as if by realloc(),
 *   respectively, such that the object is large enough to hold the
 *   characters to be written to it, including the terminating NUL, and
 *   *n will be set to the new size.  If the object was allocated, or if
 *   the reallocation operation moved the object, *lineptr will be
 *   updated to point to the new object or new location.  The characters
 *   read, including any delimiter, will be stored in the object, and a
 *   terminating NUL added when the delimiter or end-of-file is encountered.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *  Upon successful completion, the getline() and getdelim() functions will
 *  return the number of bytes written into the buffer, including the
 *  delimiter character if one was encountered before EOF, but excluding
 *  the terminating NUL character.  If the end-of-file indicator for the
 *  stream is set, or if no characters were read and the stream is at
 *  end-of-file, the end-of-file indicator for the stream will be set and
 *  the function will return -1. If an error occurs, the error indicator for
 *  the stream will be set, and the function will return -1 and set errno to
 *  indicate the error.
