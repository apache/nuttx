 * Name: vasprintf
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is similar to vsprintf, except that it dynamically
 *   allocates a string (as with malloc) to hold the output, instead of
 *   putting the output in a buffer you allocate in advance.  The ptr
 *   argument should be the address of a char * object, and a successful
 *   call to vasprintf stores a pointer to the newly allocated string at that
 *   location.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   The returned value is the number of characters allocated for the buffer,
 *   or less than zero if an error occurred. Usually this means that the
 *   buffer could not be allocated.
 *

   * Since vasprintf traverse the parameters in the va_list twice, the

   * fail. This is a known issue with x86_64.
