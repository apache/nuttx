 * Name: gets
 *
 * Description:
 *   gets() reads a line from stdin into the buffer pointed to by s until
 *   either a terminating newline or EOF, which it replaces with '\0'.  Reads
 *   at most n-1 characters from stdin into the array pointed to by str until
 *   new-line character, end-of-file condition, or read error.   The newline
 *   character, if encountered, is not saved in the array.  A NUL character
 *   is written immediately after the last character read into the array, or
 *   to str[0] if no characters were read.
 *
 *   If n is zero or is greater than RSIZE_MAX, a null character is written
 *   to str[0] but the function reads and discards characters from stdin
 *   until new-line character, end-of-file condition, or read error (not
 *   implemented).
 *
 *   If n-1 characters have been read, continues reading and discarding the
 *   characters from stdin until new-line character, end-of-file condition,
 *   or read error.
