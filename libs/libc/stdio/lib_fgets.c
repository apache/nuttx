 * Name: fgets
 *
 * Description:
 *   fgets() reads in at most one less than 'buflen' characters from stream
 *   and stores them into the buffer pointed to by 'buf'. Reading stops after
 *   an EOF or a newline.  If a newline is read, it is stored into the
 *   buffer.  A null terminator is stored after the last character in the
 *   buffer.
 *
