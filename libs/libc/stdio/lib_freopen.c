/****************************************************************************
 * Name: freopen
 *
 * Description:
 *   Reuses stream to either open the file specified by path or to change
 *   its access mode.
 *
 *   If a new path is specified, the function first attempts to close
 *   any file already associated with stream (third parameter) and
 *   disassociates it. Then, independently of whether that stream was
 *   successfully closed or not, freopen opens the file specified by path
 *   and associates it with the stream just as fopen would do using the
 *   specified mode.
 *
 *   If path is a null pointer, the function attempts to change the mode
 *   of the stream. Although a particular library implementation is allowed
 *   to restrict the changes permitted, and under which circumstances.
 *
 *   The error indicator and eof indicator are automatically cleared (as if
 *   clearerr was called).
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   path   - If non-NULL, refers to the name of the file to be opened.
 *   mode   - String describing the new file access mode
 *   stream - Pointer to the type FILE to be reopened.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   If the file is successfully reopened, the function returns the pointer
 *   passed as parameter stream, which can be used to identify the reopened
 *   stream.   Otherwise, a null pointer is returned and the errno variable
 *   is also set to a system-specific error code on failure.
