 * Name: setvbuf
 *
 * Description:
 *   The setvbuf() function may be used after the stream pointed to by
 *   stream is associated with an open file but before any other operation
 *   (other than an unsuccessful call to setvbuf()) is performed on the
 *   stream. The argument type determines how stream will be buffered, as
 *   follows:
 *
 *   _IOFBF - Will cause input/output to be fully buffered.
 *   _IOLBF - Will cause input/output to be line buffered.
 *   _IONBF - Will cause input/output to be unbuffered.
 *
 *  If buf is not a null pointer, the array it points to may be used instead
 *  of a buffer allocated by setvbuf() and the argument size specifies the
 *  size of the array; otherwise, size may determine the size of a buffer
 *  allocated by the setvbuf() function. The contents of the array at any
 *  time are unspecified.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   stream - the stream to flush
 *   buffer - the user allocate buffer. If NULL, will allocates a buffer of
 *            specified size
 *   mode   - specifies a mode for file buffering
 *   size   - size of buffer
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Upon successful completion, setvbuf() will return 0. Otherwise, it will
 *   return a non-zero value if an invalid value is given for type or if the
 *   request cannot be honored, [CX] and may set errno to indicate the error
 *
