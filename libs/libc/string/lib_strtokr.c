 * Name: strtok_r
 *
 * Description:
 *   The strtok_r() function is a reentrant version strtok().
 *   Like strtok(), it  parses  a string into a sequence of
 *   tokens.  On the first call to strtok() the string to be
 *   parsed should be specified in 'str'.  In each subsequent
 *   call that should parse the same string, 'str' should be
 *   NULL.
 *
 *   The 'saveptr' argument is a pointer to a char *
 *   variable  that  is  used internally by strtok_r() in
 *   order to maintain context between successive calls
 *   that parse the same string.
 *
 *   On the first call to strtok_r(), 'str' should point to the
 *   string to be parsed, and the value of 'saveptr' is
 *   ignored.  In subsequent calls, 'str' should be NULL, and
 *   saveptr should be unchanged since the previous call.
 *
 *   The 'delim' argument specifies a set of characters that
 *   delimit the tokens in the parsed string.  The caller
 *   may specify different strings in delim in successive
 *   calls that parse the same string.
 *
 *   Each call to strtok_r() returns a pointer to a null-
 *   terminated string containing the next token. This
 *   string  does not include the delimiting character.  If
 *   no more tokens are found, strtok_r() returns NULL.
 *
 *   A sequence of two or more contiguous delimiter
 *   characters in the parsed string is considered to be a
 *   single delimiter. Delimiter characters at the start or
 *   end of the string are ignored.  The tokens returned by
 *   strtok() are always non-empty strings.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *    strtok_r() returns a pointer to the next token, or NULL
 *    if there are no more tokens.
