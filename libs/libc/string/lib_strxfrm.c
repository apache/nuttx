 * Name: strxfrm
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function transforms the string pointed to by s2 and places the
 *   resulting string into the array pointed to by s1. The transformation is
 *   such that if the strcmp() function is applied to the two transformed
 *   strings, it returns a value greater than, equal to, or less than zero,
 *   corresponding to the result of a <<strcoll>> function applied to the
 *   same two original strings.
 *   With a C locale, this function just copies.
 *
