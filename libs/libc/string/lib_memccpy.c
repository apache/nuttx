 * Name: memccpy
 *
 * Description:
 *   The memccpy() function copies bytes from memory area s2 into s1,
 *   stopping after the first occurrence of byte c (converted to an unsigned
 *   char) is copied, or after n bytes are copied, whichever comes first. If
 *   copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is
 *   undefined.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   The memccpy() function returns a pointer to the byte after the copy of c
 *   in s1, or a null pointer if c was not found in the first n bytes of s2.
 *
