 * Name: flsl
 *
 * Description:
 *   The flsl() function will find the last bit set in value and return
 *   the index of that bit. Bits are numbered starting at one (the least
 *   significant bit).
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   The flsl() function will return the index of the last bit set. If j is
 *   0, then flsl() will return 0.
