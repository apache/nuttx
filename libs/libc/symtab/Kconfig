config ALLSYMS
	bool "Load all symbols for debugging"
	default n
	---help---
		Say Y here to let the nuttx print out symbolic crash information and
		symbolic stack backtraces. This increases the size of the nuttx
		somewhat, as all symbols have to be loaded into the nuttx image.

config SYMTAB_ORDEREDBYNAME
	bool "Symbol Tables Ordered by Name"
	default n
	---help---
		Select if the symbol table is ordered by symbol name.  In this case,
		the logic can perform faster lookups using a binary search.
		Otherwise, the symbol table is assumed to be un-ordered and only
		slow, linear searches are supported.

config SYMTAB_ORDEREDBYVALUE
	bool "Symbol Tables Ordered by Value"
	default n
	---help---
		Select if the symbol table is ordered by symbol value.

config SYMTAB_DECORATED
	bool "Symbols are decorated with leading underscores"
	default n
	---help---
		Select if symbols in relocatable objects are decorated with a leading
		underscore. This option will remove the underscore from symbol names
		when relocating a loadable object.
