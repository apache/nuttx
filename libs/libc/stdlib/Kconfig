config LIBC_RAND_ORDER
	int "Order of the random number generate"
	default 1
	range 1 3
	---help---
		The order of the random number generator. 1=fast but very bad random
		numbers, 3=slow but very good random numbers.

config LIBC_HOMEDIR
	string "Home directory"
	default "/"
	depends on !DISABLE_ENVIRON
	---help---
		The home directory to use with operations like such as 'cd ~'

config LIBC_TMPDIR
	string "Temporary file directory"
	default "/tmp"
	---help---
		If a write-able file system is selected, this string will be
		provided to specify the full path to a directory where temporary
		files can be created.  This would be a good application of RAM disk:
		To provide temporary storage for application data.

config LIBC_MAX_TMPFILE
	int "Maximum size of a temporary file path"
	default 32
	---help---
		If a write-able file system is selected, then temporary file may be
		supported at the path provided by LIBC_TMPDIR.  The tmpnam() interface
		keeps a static copy of this last filename produced; this value is the
		maximum size of that last filename.  This size is the size of the full
		file path.

config LIBC_MAX_EXITFUNS
	int "Maximum amount of exit functions"
	default 0
	---help---
		Configure the amount of exit functions for atexit/on_exit. The ANSI
		default is 32, but most likely we don't need as many.
