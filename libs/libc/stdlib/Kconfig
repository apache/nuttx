		---help---
		If a write-able file system is selected, this string will be
		provided to specify the full path to a directory where temporary
		files can be created.  This would be a good application of RAM disk:
		To provide temporary storage for application data.

config LIBC_MAX_TMPFILE
	int "Maximum size of a temporary file path"
	default 32
		---help---
		If a write-able file system is selected, then temporary file may be
		supported at the path provided by LIBC_TMPDIR.  The tmpnam() interface

		maximum size of that last filename.  This size is the size of the full
		file path.
