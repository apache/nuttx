 * Name: bsearch
 *
 * Description:
 *   The bsearch() function will search an array of nel objects, the initial
 *   element of which is pointed to by 'base', for an element that matches
 *   the object pointed to by 'key'. The size of each element in the array
 *   is specified by 'width'. If the nel argument has the value zero, the
 *   comparison function pointed to by 'compar' will not be called and no
 *   match will be found.
 *
 *   The comparison function pointed to by 'compar' will be called with two
 *   arguments that point to the 'key' object and to an array element, in
 *   that order.
 *
 *   The application will ensure that the comparison function pointed to by
 *   'compar 'does not alter the contents of the array. The implementation
 *   may reorder elements of the array between calls to the comparison
 *   function, but will not alter the contents of any individual element.
 *
 *   The implementation will ensure that the first argument is always a
 *   pointer to the 'key'.
 *
 *   When the same objects (consisting of width bytes, irrespective of their
 *   current positions in the array) are passed more than once to the
 *   comparison function, the results will be consistent with one another.
 *   That is, the same object will always compare the same way with the key.
 *
 *   The application will ensure that the function returns an integer less
 *   than, equal to, or greater than 0 if the key object is considered,
 *   respectively, to be less than, to match, or to be greater than the
 *   array element. The application will ensure that the array consists of
 *   all the elements that compare less than, all the elements that compare
 *   equal to, and all the elements that compare greater than the key
 *   object, in that order.
 *
 *   (Based on description from OpenGroup.org).
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   The bsearch() function will return a pointer to a matching member of
 *   the array, or a null pointer if no match is found. If two or more
 *   members compare equal, which member is returned is unspecified.
 *
 * Notes from the NetBSD version:
 *   The code below is a bit sneaky.  After a comparison fails, we divide
 *   the work in half by moving either left or right. If 'lim' is odd,
 *   moving left simply involves halving 'lim': e.g., when 'lim' is 5 we
 *   look at item 2, so we change 'lim' to 2 so that we will look at items
 *   0 & 1.  If 'lim' is even, the same applies.  If 'lim' is odd, moving
 *   right again involes halving 'lim', this time moving the base up one
 *   item past 'middle': e.g., when 'lim' is 5 we change base to item 3 and
 *   make 'lim' 2 so that we will look at items 3 and 4.  If 'lim' is
 *   even, however, we have to shrink it by one before halving: e.g.,
 *   when 'lim' is 4, we still looked at item 2, so we have to make 'lim'
 *   3, then halve, obtaining 1, so that we will only look at item 3.
