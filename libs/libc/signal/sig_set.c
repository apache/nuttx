 * Name: sigset
 *
 * Description:
 *   The signal() function will modify signal dispositions. The 'signo'
 *   argument specifies the signal. The 'func' argument specifies the
 *   signal's disposition, which may be SIG_DFL, SIG_IGN, or the address
 *   of a signal handler.
 *
 *   The System V sigset function is very similar to the (obsolete) POSIX
 *   signal() function except that it includes additional management of the
 *   tasks' signal mask.  This function is then simply a wrapper around
 *   signal() with this additional signal mask logic added.
 *
 *   - The sigset set function also accepts the SIG_HOLD value for 'func':
 *     If 'func' is equal to SIG_HOLD, 'signo' will be added to the signal
 *     mask of the calling process and 'signo's disposition will remain
 *     unchanged.
 *   - If 'func' is not equal to SIG_HOLD, 'signo' will be removed from the
 *     signal mask of the calling process.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   signo - Identifies the signal to operate on
 *   func  - The new disposition of the signal
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Upon successful completion, sigset() shall return SIG_HOLD if the
 *   signal had been blocked and the signal's previous disposition if it had
 *   not been blocked. Otherwise, SIG_ERR shall be returned and errno set to
 *   indicate the error.
 *
 *   Hmm.. this wording is not clear to me.  I assume this to mean:
 *
 *     if (func == SIG_HOLD)
 *       {
 *          Set mask
 *          if (mask successfully set)
 *            {
 *              return SIG_HOLD
 *            }
 *          else
 *            {
 *              return SIG_ERR
 *            }
 *     else
 *       {
 *         Set disposition
 *          if (disposition successfully set)
 *            {
 *              return old disposition
 *            }
 *          else
 *            {
 *              return SIG_ERR
 *            }
 *       }
 *
 *   But you could also argue that the English means to return SIG_HOLD in
 *   any case is the signal is blocked.  And, in that case would you set the
 *   disposition or not?  Unclear.
