 * Name: signal
 *
 * Description:
 *   The signal() function will modify signal dispositions. The 'signo'
 *   argument specifies the signal. The 'func' argument specifies the
 *   signal's disposition, which may be SIG_DFL, SIG_IGN, or the address
 *   of a signal handler.  If 'func' is the address of a signal handler, the
 *   system will add 'signo' to the calling process' signal mask before
 *   executing the signal handler; when the signal handler returns, the
 *   system will restore the calling process' signal mask to its state prior
 *   to the delivery of the signal.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   signo - Identifies the signal to operate on
 *   func  - The new disposition of the signal
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Upon successful completion, signal() will return the previous
 *   disposition of the signal handling. Otherwise, SIG_ERR will be returned
 *   and errno set to indicate the nature of the error.
 *
