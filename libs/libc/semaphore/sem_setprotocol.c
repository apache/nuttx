/****************************************************************************
 * Name: nxsem_set_protocol
 *
 * Description:
 *    Set semaphore protocol attribute.
 *
 *    One particularly important use of this function is when a semaphore
 *    is used for inter-task communication like:
 *
 *      TASK A                 TASK B
 *      nxsem_init(sem, 0, 0);
 *      nxsem_wait(sem);
 *                             snxem_post(sem);
 *      Awakens as holder
 *
 *    In this case priority inheritance can interfere with the operation of
 *    the semaphore.  The problem is that when TASK A is restarted it is a
 *    holder of the semaphore.  However, it never calls nxsem_post(sem) so it
 *    becomes *permanently* a holder of the semaphore and may have its
 *    priority boosted when any other task tries to acquire the semaphore.
 *
 *    The fix is to call nxsem_set_protocol(SEM_PRIO_NONE) immediately after
 *    the sem_init() call so that there will be no priority inheritance
 *    operations on this semaphore.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *    sem      - A pointer to the semaphore whose attributes are to be
 *               modified
 *    protocol - The new protocol to use
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This function is exposed as a non-standard application interface.  It
 *   returns zero (OK) if successful.  Otherwise, -1 (ERROR) is returned and
 *   the errno value is set appropriately.
