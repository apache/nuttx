 * Name:  wcsncmp
 *
 * Description:
 *    Compares up to "n" characters of the C wide string "l" to those of
 *    the C wide string "r".
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   l - the wchar string to be compared
 *   r - the wchar string to be compared
 *   n - maximum number of wide characters to be compared
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Return 0 if the characters compared in both strings form the same
 *   string.
 *   Return value greater than 0 if the first character that does not match
 *   has a greater value in "l" than in "r"
 *   Reutrn value less than 0 otherswise
