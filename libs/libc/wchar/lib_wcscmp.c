 * Description:
 *   The wcscmp() function returns zero if the wide-character strings at s1
 *   and s2 are equal. It returns an integer greater than zero if at the
 *   first differing position i, the corresponding wide-character s1[i] is
 *   greater than s2[i].  It returns an integer less than zero if at the
 *   first differing position i, the corresponding wide-character s1[i] is
 *   less than s2[i]
