 * Name: mbsnrtowcs
 *
 * Description:
 *   The 'mbsrtowcs' function converts a sequence of multibyte characters
 *   pointed to indirectly by 'src' into a sequence of corresponding wide
 *   characters and stores at most 'len' of them in the wchar_t array pointed
 *   to by 'dst', until it encounters a terminating null character ('\0').
 *
 *   If 'dst' is NULL, no characters are stored.
 *
 *   If 'dst' is not NULL, the pointer pointed to by 'src' is updated to
 *   point to the character after the one that conversion stopped at.  If
 *   conversion stops because a null character is encountered, *'src' is set
 *   to NULL.
 *
 *   The mbstate_t argument, 'ps', is used to keep track of the shift state.
 *   If it is NULL, 'mbsrtowcs' uses an internal, static mbstate_t object,
 *   which is initialized to the initial conversion state at program startup.
 *
 *   The 'mbsnrtowcs' function behaves identically to 'mbsrtowcs', except
 *   that conversion stops after reading at most 'nms' bytes from the buffer
 *   pointed to by 'src'.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   The 'mbsrtowcs' and 'mbsnrtowcs' functions return the number of wide
 *   characters stored in the array pointed to by 'dst' if successful,
 *   otherwise it returns (size_t)-1.
 *
 * Portability:
 *   'mbsrtowcs' is defined by the C99 standard.
 *   'mbsnrtowcs' is defined by the POSIX.1-2008 standard.
