 * Name: wcsxfrm
 *
 * Description:
 *   The wcsxfrm() transforms the wide-character string pointed to by b to
 *   the wide-character string pointed to by a, comparing two transformed
 *   wide strings with wcscmp() should return the same result as comparing
 *   the original strings with wcscoll().
 *   No more than n wide characters are transformed, including the trailing
 *   null character. The current implementation of wcsxfrm() simply uses
 *   wcslcpy() and does not support any language-specific transformations.
 *
