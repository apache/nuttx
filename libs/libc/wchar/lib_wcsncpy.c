 * Name:  wcsncpy
 *
 * Description:
 *    Copies the first num characters of source to destination. If the end
 *    of the source C wide string (which is signaled by a null wide
 *    character) is found before num characters have been copied, destination
 *    is padded with additional null wide characters until a total of num
 *    characters have been written to it.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   d - the destination wchar string where the content is to be copied
 *   s - the wchar string to be copied
 *   n - maximum number of wide characters to be copied from source
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   A pointer to the destination string
