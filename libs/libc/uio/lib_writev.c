 * Name: writev()
 *
 * Description:
 *   The writev() function is equivalent to write(), except as described
 *   below. The writev() function will gather output data from the 'iovcnt'
 *   buffers specified by the members of the 'iov' array:
 *   iov[0], iov[1], ..., iov[iovcnt-1].
 *   The 'iovcnt' argument is valid if greater than 0 and less than or equal
 *   to IOV_MAX, as defined in limits.h.
 *
 *   Each iovec entry specifies the base address and length of an area in
 *   memory from which data should be written. The writev() function always
 *   writes a complete area before proceeding to the next.
 *
 *   If 'filedes' refers to a regular file and all of the iov_len members in
 *   the array pointed to by iov are 0, writev() will return 0 and have no
 *   other effect. For other file types, the behavior is unspecified.
 *
 *   TODO: If the sum of the iov_len values is greater than SSIZE_MAX, the
 *   operation will fail and no data will be transferred.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   filedes - The open file descriptor for the file to be read
 *   iov     - Array of read buffer descriptors
 *   iovcnt  - Number of elements in iov[]
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Upon successful completion, writev() shall return the number of bytes
 *   actually written. Otherwise, it shall return a value of -1, the file-
 *   pointer shall remain unchanged, and errno shall be set to indicate an
 *   error. See write for the list of returned errno values. In addition,
 *   the readv() function will fail if:
 *
 *    EINVAL.
 *      The sum of the iov_len values in the iov array overflowed an ssize_t
 *      or The 'iovcnt' argument was less than or equal to 0, or greater than
 *      IOV_MAX (Not implemented).
