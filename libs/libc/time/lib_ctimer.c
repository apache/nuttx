 * Name:  ctime_r
 *
 * Description:
 *   ctime and ctime_r convert the time provided in seconds since the
 *   epoch to a string representation. ctime is not re-entrant; ctime_r is
 *   re-entrant.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   timep - The current time represented as seconds since the epoch.
 *   buf   - A user provided buffer to receive the 26 character time string.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   One success, the pointer to the 'buf' is returned; on failure, NULL is
 *   returned.
