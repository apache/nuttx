		localtime API call support

		Logic currently depends on file system support with, at a minimum, these
		files in the zoneinfo directory:  GMT and posixrules.  An additional
		timezone file is required for any additional, local time zone(s) and the
		environment variable TZ must be set to the name of that timezone file
		when tzset() is called.

		See https://www.iana.org/time-zones .  See also nuttx/zoneinfo
		which provides a framework for incorporating the TZ database into a
		NuttX build.

config LIBC_TZ_MAX_TIMES
	int "Maximum number of times in timezone"
	default 370
	---help---
		Timezone files with more than this number of times will not be used
		(timecnt).

		Warning: Some files in IANA TZ database include many times.  The current
		posixrules file, for example, has timecnt = 236.  The value of
		TX_MAX_ITMES in the tzfile.h header file on my Linux system is 370, the
		default used here.  You may want to reduce this value for a smaller
		footprint.

config LIBC_TZ_MAX_TYPES
	int "Maximum number of TZ types"
	default 20
	---help---
		Maximum number of local time types.  You may want to reduce this value
		for a smaller footprint.

config LIBC_TZDIR
	string "zoneinfo directory path"
	default "/etc/zoneinfo"
	---help---
		This is the full path to the location where the TZ database is expected
		to be found.

config LIB_ZONEINFO
	bool "TZ database"
	default n
	---help---
		Download and build the TZ/Olson database.

if LIB_ZONEINFO

config LIB_ZONEINFO_ROMFS
	bool "Build ROMFS filesystem"
	default n
	depends on FS_ROMFS
	---help---
		Build a mountable ROMFS filesystem containing the TZ/Olson database
