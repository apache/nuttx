 * name inet_addr
 *
 * Description:
 *   The inet_addr() function converts the string pointed to by cp, in the
 *   standard IPv4 dotted decimal notation, to an integer value suitable for
 *   use as an Internet address.
 *
 *   inet_aton() returns nonzero if the address is valid, zero if not.
 *   The address supplied in cp can have one of the following forms:
 *
 *   a.b.c.d Each of the four numeric parts specifies a byte of the address;
 *           the bytes are assigned in left-to-right order to produce the
 *           binary address.
 *
 *   a.b.c   Parts a and b specify the first two bytes of the binary address.
 *           Part c is interpreted as a 16-bit value that defines the
 *           rightmost two bytes of the binary address. This notation is
 *           suitable for specifying (outmoded) Class B network addresses.
 *
 *   a.b     Part a specifies the first byte of the binary address. Part b is
 *           interpreted as a 24-bit value that defines the rightmost three
 *           bytes of the binary address. This notation is suitable for
 *           specifying (outmoded) Class A network addresses.
 *
 *   a       The value a is interpreted as a 32-bit value that is stored
 *           directly into the binary address without any byte rearrangement.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   If input string cannot be recognized as a valid IPv4 number, function
 *   returns zero.
