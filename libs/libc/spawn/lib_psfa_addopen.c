 * Name: posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen
 *
 * Description:
 *   The posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen() function adds an open operation
 *   to the list of operations associated with the object referenced by
 *   file_actions, for subsequent use in a call to posix_spawn() or
 *   posix_spawnp().  The descriptor referred to by fd is opened using
 *   the path, oflag, and mode arguments as if open() had been called on it
 *   prior to the new child process starting execution.  The string path is
 *   copied by the posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen() function during this
 *   process, so storage need not be persistent in the caller.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   file_actions - The posix_spawn_file_actions_t to append the action.
 *   fd - The file descriptor to be opened.
 *   path - The path to be opened.
 *   oflags - Open flags
 *   mode - File creation mode
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, these functions return 0; on failure they return an error
 *   number from <errno.h>.
 *
