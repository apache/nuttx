 * Name: dlsymtab
 *
 * Description:
 *   dlsymtab() is a non-standard shared library interface.  It selects the
 *   symbol table to use when binding a shared library to the base firmware
 *   which may be in FLASH memory.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   symtab   - The new symbol table.
 *   nsymbols - The number of symbols in the symbol table.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Always returns OK.
 *

   * the user space of each process, but must lie at the same virtual address
