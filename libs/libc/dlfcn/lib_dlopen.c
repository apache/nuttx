/****************************************************************************
 * Name: dlopen
 *
 * Description:
 *   dlopen() makes an executable object file specified by file available to
 *   the calling program.  The class of files eligible for this operation and
 *   the manner of their construction are specified by the implementation,
 *   though typically such files are executable objects such as shared
 *   libraries, relocatable files or programs. Note that some implementations
 *   permit the construction of dependencies between such objects that are
 *   embedded within files. In such cases, a dlopen() operation will load
 *   such dependencies in addition to the object referenced by file.
 *   Implementations may also impose specific constraints on the construction
 *   of programs that can employ dlopen() and its related services.
 *
 *   If a file is specified in multiple dlopen() invocations, mode is
 *   interpreted at each invocation. Note, however, that once RTLD_NOW has
 *   been specified all relocations will have been completed rendering
 *   further RTLD_NOW operations redundant and any further RTLD_LAZY
 *   operations irrelevant.  Similarly note that once RTLD_GLOBAL has been
 *   specified the object will maintain the RTLD_GLOBAL status regardless
 *   of any previous or future specification of RTLD_LOCAL, so long as the
 *   object remains in the address space (see dlclose()).
 *
 *   Symbols introduced into a program through calls to dlopen() may be
 *   used in relocation activities. Symbols so introduced may duplicate
 *   symbols already defined by the program or previous dlopen()
 *   operations. To resolve the ambiguities such a situation might
 *   present, the resolution of a symbol reference to symbol definition is
 *   based on a symbol resolution order. Two such resolution orders are
 *   defined: load or dependency ordering. Load order establishes an
 *   ordering among symbol definitions, such that the definition first
 *   loaded (including definitions from the image file and any dependent
 *   objects loaded with it) has priority over objects added later (via
 *   dlopen()). Load ordering is used in relocation processing. Dependency
 *   ordering uses a breadth-first order starting with a given object,
 *   then all of its dependencies, then any dependents of those, iterating
 *   until all dependencies are satisfied. With the exception of the global
 *   symbol object obtained via a dlopen() operation on a file of 0,
 *   dependency ordering is used by the dlsym() function. Load ordering is
 *   used in dlsym() operations upon the global symbol object.
 *
 *   When an object is first made accessible via dlopen() it and its
 *   dependent objects are added in dependency order. Once all the objects
 *   are added, relocations are performed using load order. Note that if an
 *   object or its dependencies had been previously loaded, the load and
 *   dependency orders may yield different resolutions.
 *
 *   The symbols introduced by dlopen() operations, and available through
 *   dlsym() are at a minimum those which are exported as symbols of global
 *   scope by the object. Typically such symbols will be those that were
 *   specified in (for example) C source code as having extern linkage. The
 *   precise manner in which an implementation constructs the set of
 *   exported symbols for a dlopen() object is specified by that
 *   implementation.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   file - Used to construct a pathname to the object file. If file
 *          contains a slash character, the file argument is used as the
 *          pathname for the file. Otherwise, file is used in an
 *          implementation-dependent manner to yield a pathname.
 *
 *          If the value of file is 0, dlopen() provides a handle on a
 *          global symbol object. This object provides access to the symbols
 *          from an ordered set of objects consisting of the original
 *          program image file, together with any objects loaded at program
 *          startup as specified by that process image file (for example,
 *          shared libraries), and the set of objects loaded using a
 *          dlopen() operation together with the RTLD_GLOBAL flag. As the
 *          latter set of objects can change during execution, the set
 *          identified by handle can also change dynamically.
 *
 *          Only a single copy of an object file is brought into the address
 *          space, even if dlopen() is invoked multiple times in reference
 *          to the file, and even if different pathnames are used to
 *          reference the file.
 *  mode  - Describes how dlopen() will operate upon file with respect to
 *          the processing of relocations and the scope of visibility of the
 *          symbols provided within file. When an object is brought into the
 *          address space of a process, it may contain references to symbols
 *          whose addresses are not known until the object is loaded. These
 *          references must be relocated before the symbols can be accessed.
 *          The mode parameter governs when these relocations take place.
 *          See definitions above for values of the mode parameter:.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   A successful dlopen() returns a handle which the caller may use on
 *   subsequent calls to dlsym() and dlclose(). The value of this handle
 *   should not be interpreted in any way by the caller.
 *
 *   If file cannot be found, cannot be opened for reading, is not of an
 *   appropriate object format for processing by dlopen(), or if an error
 *   occurs during the process of loading file or relocating its symbolic
 *   references, dlopen() will return NULL. More detailed diagnostic
 *   information will be available through dlerror().
