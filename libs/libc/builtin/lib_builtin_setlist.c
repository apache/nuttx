 * Name: builtin_setlist
 *
 * Description:
 *   Saves the user-space list of built-in applications for use by BINFS in
 *   protected mode.  Normally this is small set of globals provided by
 *   user-space logic.  It provides name-value pairs for associating
 *   built-in application names with user-space entry point addresses.
 *   These globals are only needed for use by BINFS which executes built-in
 *   applications from kernel-space in PROTECTED mode.  In the FLAT build,
 *   the user space globals are readily available.  (BINFS is not
 *   supportable in KERNEL mode since user-space address have no general
 *   meaning that configuration).
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   builtins - The list of built-in functions.  Each entry is a name-value
 *              pair that maps a built-in function name to its user-space
 *              entry point address.
 *   count    - The number of name-value pairs in the built-in list.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
