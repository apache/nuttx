	---help---
		By default, no math library will be provided by NuttX.  In this
		case, it is assumed that (1) no math library is required, or (2) you
		will be using the math.h and float.h headers file and the libm
		library provided by your toolchain.

		This is may be a very good choice is possible because your toolchain
		may have have a highly optimized version of libm.

		Another possibility is that you have a custom, architecture-specific
		math library and that the corresponding math.h file resides at
		arch/<architecture>/include/math.h.  The option is selected via
		CONFIG_ARCH_MATH_H.  If ARCH_MATH_H is selected,then the
		include/nuttx/libmath.h header file will be copied to include/math.h
		where it can be used by your applications.

		If ARCH_MATH_H is not defined, then this option can be selected to
		build a generic, math library built into NuttX.  This math library
		comes from the Rhombus OS and was written by Nick Johnson.  The
		Rhombus OS math library port was contributed by Darcy Gong.
