 * Name: nx_redrawreq
 *
 * Description:
 *   This will cause a NX re-draw callback to the client that owns the
 *   window.  This is not normally called from user code, but may be
 *   used within middle-ware layers when redrawing is needed.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   hwnd - Window handle
 *   rect - The rectangle that needs to be re-drawn (in window relative
 *          coordinates)
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
 *
