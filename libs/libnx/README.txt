======

  The graphics capability consist both of components internal to the RTOS
  and of user-callable interfaces.  In the NuttX kernel mode build there are
  some components of the graphics subsystem are callable in user mode and
  other components that are internal to the RTOS.  This directory, libs/libnx/,
  contains only those user-callable components.

  The RTOS internal functions are contained in the graphics/ directory.
  Please refer to graphics/README.txt for more detailed information.
