menuconfig LIBDSP
	bool "Digital Signal Processing Library"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable build for various DSP functions

if LIBDSP

config LIBDSP_DEBUG
	bool "Libdsp debugging"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable debugging for libdsp. This option enables additional parameters
		checking. It can drastically reduce performance and be potentially
		dangerous to hardware, so it should be used carefully (probably only
		at an early stage of application development).

config LIBDSP_PRECISION
	int "Libdsp precision [0/1/2]"
	default 0
	---help---
		With this option we can select libdsp precision for
		some of calculations. There are 3 available options:
		0 - the fastest calculation but the lowest precision,
		1 - increased precision than for option 0 at the expense
		    of a longer execution time,
		2 - the most accuracte but the slowest one, use standard math functions.

config LIBDSP_FOC_VABC
	bool "Libdsp FOC includes voltage abc frame"

endif # LIBDSP
