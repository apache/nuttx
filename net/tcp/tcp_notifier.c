 * Name: tcp_readahead_notifier_setup
 *
 * Description:
 *   Set up to perform a callback to the worker function when an TCP data
 *   is added to the read-ahead buffer.  The worker function will execute
 *   on the low priority worker thread.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   worker - The worker function to execute on the low priority work
 *            queue when data is available in the TCP read-ahead buffer.
 *   conn  - The TCP connection where read-ahead data is needed.
 *   arg    - A user-defined argument that will be available to the worker
 *            function when it runs.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   > 0   - The notification is in place.  The returned value is a key that
 *           may be used later in a call to tcp_notifier_teardown().
 *   == 0  - There is already buffered read-ahead data.  No notification
 *           will be provided.
 *   < 0   - An unexpected error occurred and notification will occur.  The
 *           returned value is a negated errno value that indicates the
 *           nature of the failure.
