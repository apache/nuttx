config NET_TCP
	bool "TCP/IP Networking"
	default n
	select NET_READAHEAD if !NET_TCP_NO_STACK
	---help---
		Enable or disable TCP networking support.

config NET_TCP_NO_STACK
	bool "Disable TCP/IP Stack"
	default n
	select NET_TCP
	---help---
		Build without TCP/IP stack even if TCP networking support enabled.

if NET_TCP && !NET_TCP_NO_STACK

config NET_TCP_DELAYED_ACK
	bool "TCP/IP Delayed ACK"
	default n
	---help---
		RFC 1122:  A host that is receiving a stream of TCP data segments
		can increase efficiency in both the Internet and the hosts
		by sending fewer than one ACK (acknowledgment) segment per data
		segment received; this is known as a "delayed ACK".

		TCP should implement a delayed ACK, but an ACK should not be
		excessively delayed; in particular, the delay MUST be less than
		0.5 seconds, and in a stream of full-sized segments there should
		be an ACK for at least every second segments.

config NET_TCP_KEEPALIVE
	bool "TCP/IP Keep-alive support"
	default n
	select NET_TCPPROTO_OPTIONS
	---help---
		Enable support for the SO_KEEPALIVE socket option

config NET_TCPURGDATA
	bool "Urgent data"
	default n
	---help---
		Determines if support for TCP urgent data notification should be
		compiled in. Urgent data (out-of-band data) is a rarely used TCP feature
		that is very seldom would be required.

config NET_TCP_CONNS
	int "Number of TCP/IP connections"
	default 8
	---help---
		Maximum number of TCP/IP connections (all tasks)

config NET_TCP_NPOLLWAITERS
	int "Number of TCP poll waiters"
	default 1

config NET_TCP_RTO
	int "RTO of TCP/IP connections"
	default 3
	---help---
		RTO of TCP/IP connections (all tasks)

config NET_TCP_WAIT_TIMEOUT
	int "TIME_WAIT Length of TCP/IP connections"
	default 120
	---help---
		TIME_WAIT Length of TCP/IP connections (all tasks).  In units
		of seconds.

config NET_MAX_LISTENPORTS
	int "Number of listening ports"
	default 20
	---help---
		Maximum number of listening TCP/IP ports (all tasks).  Default: 20

config NET_TCP_NOTIFIER
	bool "Support TCP notifications"
	default n
	depends on SCHED_WORKQUEUE
	select WQUEUE_NOTIFIER
	---help---
		Enable building of TCP notifier logic that will execute a worker
		function on the low priority work queue when read-ahead data
		is available or when a TCP connection is lost.  This is is a general
		purpose notifier, but was developed specifically to support poll()
		logic where the poll must wait for these events.

config NET_TCP_WRITE_BUFFERS
	bool "Enable TCP/IP write buffering"
	default n
	select NET_WRITE_BUFFERS
	---help---
		Write buffers allows buffering of ongoing TCP/IP packets, providing
		for higher performance, streamed output.

		You might want to disable TCP/IP write buffering on a highly memory
		memory constrained system where there are no performance issues.

if NET_TCP_WRITE_BUFFERS

config NET_TCP_NWRBCHAINS
	int "Number of pre-allocated I/O buffer chain heads"
	default 8
	---help---
		These tiny nodes are used as "containers" to support queuing of
		TCP write buffers.  This setting will limit the number of TCP write
		operations that can be "in-flight" at any give time.  So a good
		choice for this value would be the same as the maximum number of
		TCP connections.

config NET_TCP_WRBUFFER_DEBUG
	bool "Force write buffer debug"
	default n
	depends on DEBUG_FEATURES
	select IOB_DEBUG
	---help---
		This option will force debug output from TCP write buffer logic,
		even without network debug output.  This is not normally something
		that would want to do but is convenient if you are debugging the
		write buffer logic and do not want to get overloaded with other
		network-related debug output.

config NET_TCP_WRBUFFER_DUMP
	bool "Force write buffer dump"
	default n
	depends on DEBUG_NET || NET_TCP_WRBUFFER_DEBUG
	select IOB_DEBUG
	---help---
		Dump the contents of the write buffers.  You do not want to do this
		unless you really want to analyze the write buffer transfers in
		detail.

endif # NET_TCP_WRITE_BUFFERS

config NET_TCPBACKLOG
	bool "TCP/IP backlog support"
	default n
	---help---
		Incoming connections pend in a backlog until accept() is called.
		The size of the backlog is selected when listen() is called.

if NET_TCPBACKLOG

config NET_TCPBACKLOG_CONNS
	int "TCP backlog conns threshold"
	default 8
	---help---
		Maximum number of TCP backlog connections (all tasks).

endif # NET_TCPBACKLOG

config NET_TCP_SPLIT
	bool "Enable packet splitting"
	default n
	depends on !NET_TCP_WRITE_BUFFERS
	---help---
		send() will not return until the transfer has been ACKed by the
		recipient.  But under RFC 1122, the host need not ACK each packet
		immediately; the host may wait for 500 MS before ACKing.  This
		combination can cause very slow performance with small transfers are
		made to an RFC 1122 client.  However, the RFC 1122 must ACK at least
		every second (odd) packet.

		This option enables logic to trick the RFC 1122 host be exploiting
		this last RFC 1122 requirement:  If an odd number of packets were to
		be sent, then send() will split the last even packet to guarantee
		that an even number of packets will be sent and the RFC 1122 host
		will ACK the final packet immediately.

if NET_TCP_SPLIT

config NET_TCP_SPLIT_SIZE
	int "Split size threshold"
	default 40
	---help---
		Packets of this size or smaller than this will not be split.

endif # NET_TCP_SPLIT

config NET_SENDFILE
	bool "Optimized network sendfile()"
	default n
	---help---
		Support larger, higher performance sendfile() for transferring
		files out a TCP connection.
