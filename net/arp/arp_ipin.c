 * Name: arp_ipin
 *
 * Description:
 *   The arp_ipin() function should be called by Ethernet device drivers
 *   whenever an IP packet arrives from the network.  The function will
 *   check if the address is in the ARP cache, and if so the ARP cache entry
 *   will be refreshed. If no ARP cache entry was found, a new one is
 *   created.
 *
 *   This function expects that an IP packet with an Ethernet header is
 *   present in the d_buf buffer and that the length of the packet is in the
 *   d_len field.
 *
