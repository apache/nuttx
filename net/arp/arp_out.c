/****************************************************************************
 * Name: arp_out
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function should be called before sending out an IP packet. The
 *   function checks the destination IP address of the IP packet to see
 *   what Ethernet MAC address that should be used as a destination MAC
 *   address on the Ethernet.
 *
 *   If the destination IP address is in the local network (determined
 *   by logical ANDing of netmask and our IP address), the function
 *   checks the ARP cache to see if an entry for the destination IP
 *   address is found.  If so, an Ethernet header is pre-pended at the
 *   beginning of the packet and the function returns.
 *
 *   If no ARP cache entry is found for the destination IP address, the
 *   packet in the d_buf is replaced by an ARP request packet for the
 *   IP address. The IP packet is dropped and it is assumed that the
 *   higher level protocols (e.g., TCP) eventually will retransmit the
 *   dropped packet.
 *
 *   Upon return in either the case, a packet to be sent is present in the
 *   d_buf buffer and the d_len field holds the length of the Ethernet
 *   frame that should be transmitted.
