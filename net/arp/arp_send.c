/****************************************************************************
 * Name: arp_send
 *
 * Description:
 *   The arp_send() call may be to send an ARP request to resolve an IP
 *   address.  This function first checks if the IP address is already in
 *   ARP table.  If so, then it returns success immediately.
 *
 *   If the requested IP address in not in the ARP table, then this function
 *   will send an ARP request, delay, then check if the IP address is now in
 *   the ARP table.  It will repeat this sequence until either (1) the IP
 *   address mapping is now in the ARP table, or (2) a configurable number
 *   of timeouts occur without receiving the ARP replay.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   ipaddr   The IP address to be queried (in network order).
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success and the IP address mapping can now be
 *   found in the ARP table.  On error a negated errno value is returned:
 *
 *     -ETIMEDOUT:    The number or retry counts has been exceed.
 *     -EHOSTUNREACH: Could not find a route to the host
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   This function is called from the normal tasking context.
