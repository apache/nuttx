 * Name: arp_arpin
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function should be called by the Ethernet device driver when an
 *   ARP packet has been received.   The function will act differently
 *   depending on the ARP packet type: if it is a reply for a request
 *   that we previously sent out, the ARP cache will be filled in with
 *   the values from the ARP reply.  If the incoming ARP packet is an ARP
 *   request for our IP address, an ARP reply packet is created and put
 *   into the d_buf buffer.
 *
 *   On entry, this function expects that an ARP packet with a prepended
 *   Ethernet header is present in the d_buf buffer and that the length of
 *   the packet is set in the d_len field.
 *
 *   When the function returns, the value of the field d_len indicates
 *   whether the device driver should send out the ARP reply packet or not.
 *   If d_len is zero, no packet should be sent; If d_len is non-zero, it
 *   contains the length of the outbound packet that is present in the
 *   d_buf buffer.
 *
