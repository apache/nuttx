config NET_NAT
	bool "Network Address Translation (NAT)"
	default n
	depends on NET_IPFORWARD && IOB_BUFSIZE >= 68
	---help---
		Enable or disable Network Address Translation (NAT) function.

		Note: When forwarding IPv4 packet and applying NAT, NAT may be
		applied directly on a single I/O buffer containing L3 packet header,
		and NAT may need a continuous buffer of at least 68 Bytes
		(IPv4 20B + ICMP 8B + IPv4 20B + TCP 20B).

config NET_NAT_TCP_EXPIRE_SEC
	int "TCP NAT entry expiration seconds"
	default 86400
	depends on NET_NAT
	---help---
		The expiration time for idle TCP entry in NAT.

		Note: The default value 86400 is suggested by RFC2663, Section 2.6,
		Page 5.

config NET_NAT_UDP_EXPIRE_SEC
	int "UDP NAT entry expiration seconds"
	default 240
	depends on NET_NAT
	---help---
		The expiration time for idle UDP entry in NAT.

		Note: RFC2663 (Section 2.6, Page 5) suggests that non-TCP sessions
		that have not been used for a couple of minutes can be assumed to be
		terminated.

config NET_NAT_ICMP_EXPIRE_SEC
	int "ICMP NAT entry expiration seconds"
	default 60
	depends on NET_NAT
	---help---
		The expiration time for idle ICMP entry in NAT.

		Note: The default value 60 is suggested by RFC5508, Section 3.2,
		Page 8.
