config NET_IPFORWARD
	bool "Enable L2 forwarding"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable forwarding of packets.  Packets received with IP addresses
		that are not supported by this platform will be forwarded to the
		appropriate network device.  Routing table support may be required.

config NET_IPFORWARD_BROADCAST
	bool "Forward broadcast/multicast packets"
	default n
	depends on NET_IPFORWARD
	---help---
		If selected, broadcast packets received on one network device will
		be forwarded though other network devices.

config NET_IPFORWARD_NSTRUCT
	int "Number of pre-allocated forwarding structures"
	default 4
	depends on NET_IPFORWARD
	---help---
		When packets are forwarded from on device to another, a structure
		must be allocated to hold the state of forwarding across several
		asynchronous events.  Those structures are pre-allocated for
		minimal, deterministic performance and to prevent hogging of memory
		(of course, that means that this value must be carefully selected
		for your application).  This setting defines the number of such pre-
		allocated structures.

		NOTE: This setting effectively puts a maximum on the number of
		packets that may be waiting to be forwarded from one network device
		to another.  CONFIG_IOB_NBUFFERS also limits the forward because the
		payload of the packet (up to the MSS) is retain in IOBs.

		WARNING: DO NOT set this setting to a value greater than or equal to
		CONFIG_IOB_NBUFFERS, otherwise it may consume all the IOB and let
		netdev fail to work.
