 * Description:
 *   Decrement the IPv4 TTL (time to live value).  TTL field is set by the

 * Input Parameters:
 *   ipv4  - A pointer to the IPv4 header in within the IPv4 packet to be
 *           forwarded.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   The new TTL value is returned.  A value <= 0 means the hop limit has
