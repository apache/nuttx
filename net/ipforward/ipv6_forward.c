 * Description:

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: ipv6_forward_broadcast
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is called from ipv6_input when a broadcast or multicast
 *   packet is received.  If CONFIG_NET_IPFORWARD_BROADCAST is enabled, this
 *   function will forward the broadcast packet to other networks through
 *   other network devices.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   dev   - The device on which the packet was received and which contains
 *           the IPv6 packet.
 *   ipv6  - A convenience pointer to the IPv6 header in within the IPv6
 *           packet
 *
 *   On input:
 *   - dev->d_buf holds the received packet.
 *   - dev->d_len holds the length of the received packet MINUS the
 *     size of the L1 header.  That was subtracted out by ipv6_input.
 *   - ipv6 points to the IPv6 header with dev->d_buf.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
 *
