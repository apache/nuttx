	---help---
		Enable support for raw, IEEE 802.15.4 sockets.

		Raw sockets allow receiving and transmitting IEEE 802.15.4 radio
		frames without a layer2 protocol such as 6LoWPAN in between. Frames
		received are copied into a IEEE 802.15.4 socket tap before they
		enter the network. Frames written into a IEEE 802.15.4 socket will
		bypass the network altogether and will be sent directly to the
		IEEE 802.15.4 MAC network interface driver outgoing frame queue.

	int "IEEE 802.15.4 Frame Length"
	default 127
	range 1 999999
	---help---
		For standard IEEE 802.15.4 radios, this should always be 127 bytes.
		However, some IEEE 802.15.4 radios may non-standard frame lengths.

		This setting is currently used only for detection data transfers
		that would exceed the radio frame length.

config NET_IEEE802154_NCONTAINERS
	int "Number of pre-allocated frame containers"
	default 8
	---help---
		This specifies the total number of preallocated frame containers.
		One must be allocated with each incoming frame.

config NET_IEEE802154_BACKLOG
	int "Maximum frame backlog"
	default 8
	range 0 255
	---help---
		As frames are received, then are help in an RX queue.  They remain
		in the RX queue until application logic reads the queue frames.  To
		prevent overrun, the maximum backlog may be set to a nonzero value.
		What the backlog of queue frames reaches that count, the olds frame
		will be freed, preventing overrun at the cost of losing the oldest
		frames.

		NOTE: The special value of zero will disable all backlog checkes.
