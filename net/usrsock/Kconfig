config NET_USRSOCK
	bool "User-space networking stack API"
	default n
	depends on NET
	---help---
		Enable or disable user-space networking stack support.

		User-space networking stack API allows user-space daemon to
		provide TCP/IP stack implementation for NuttX network.

		Main use for this is to allow use and integration of
		HW-provided TCP/IP stacks for NuttX.

		For example, user-space daemon can translate /dev/usrsock API
		requests to HW TCP/IP API requests while rest of the user-space
		can access standard socket API, with socket descriptors that
		can be used with NuttX system calls.

config NET_USRSOCK_PREALLOC_CONNS
	int "Preallocated usrsock connections"
	default 6
	---help---
		Number of usrsock connections (all tasks).

		This number of connections will be pre-allocated during system boot.
		If dynamic connections allocation is enabled, more connections may
		be allocated at a later time, as the system needs them. Else this
		will be the maximum number of connections available to the system
		at all times.

		Set to 0 to disable (and rely only on dynamic allocations).

		Note: Usrsock daemon can impose additional restrictions for
		maximum number of concurrent connections supported.

config NET_USRSOCK_ALLOC_CONNS
	int "Dynamic usrsock connections allocation"
	default 0
	---help---
		Dynamic memory allocations for usrsock.

		When set to 0 all dynamic allocations are disabled.

		When set to 1 a new connection will be allocated every time,
		and it will be free'd when no longer needed.

		Setting this to 2 or more will allocate the connections in
		batches (with batch size equal to this config). When a
		connection is no longer needed, it will be returned to the
		free connections pool, and it will never be deallocated!

config NET_USRSOCK_MAX_CONNS
	int "Maximum number of usrsock connections"
	default 0
	depends on NET_USRSOCK_ALLOC_CONNS > 0
	---help---
		If dynamic connections allocation is selected (NET_USRSOCK_ALLOC_CONNS > 0)
		this will limit the number of connections that can be allocated.

		This is useful in case the system is under very heavy load (or
		under attack), ensuring that the heap will not be exhausted.

config NET_USRSOCK_NPOLLWAITERS
	int "Number of usrsock poll waiters"
	default 1
