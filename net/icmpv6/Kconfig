config NET_ICMPv6
	bool "Enable ICMPv6 networking"
	default n
	depends on NET
	---help---
		Enable minimal ICMPv6 support. Includes built-in support
		for sending replies to received ECHO (ping) requests.

config NET_ICMPv6_PING
	bool "ICMPv6 ping interfaces"
	default n
	---help---
		Provide interfaces to support application level support for
		for sending ECHO (ping) requests and associating ECHO replies.

config NET_ICMPv6_NEIGHBOR
	bool "Solicit destination addresses"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable logic to send ICMPv6 neighbor solicitation requests if
		the target IPv6 address mapping does not appear in the Neighbor
		table.

if NET_ICMPv6_NEIGHBOR

config ICMPv6_NEIGHBOR_MAXTRIES
	int "ICMPv6 solicitation retries"
	default 5
	---help---
		Send the Neighbor solicitation this number of times before giving
		up and deciding that the target IP6 address is non reachable.

config ICMPv6_NEIGHBOR_DELAYMSEC
	int "ICMPv6 re-solicit delay"
	default 20
	---help---
		Wait this number of milliseconds after sending the Neighbor
		Solicitation before checking if the IPv6 address mapping is present
		in the Neighbor Table.  This time should be related to the maximum
		round trip time on the network since it is basically the time from
		when an Neighbor Solicitation is sent until the Neighbor
		Advertisement is received.
