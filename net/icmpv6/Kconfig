config NET_ICMPv6
	bool "Enable ICMPv6 networking"
	default n
	depends on NET
	---help---
		Enable minimal ICMPv6 support. Includes built-in support
		for sending replies to received ECHO (ping) requests.

config NET_ICMPv6_NO_STACK
	bool "Disable ICMPv6 stack"
	default n
	select NET_ICMPv6
	---help---
		Build without ICMPv6 stack even if ICMPv6 networking support enabled.

config NET_ICMPv6_SOCKET
	bool "IPPROTO_ICMP6 socket support"
	default n
	select MM_IOB
	---help---
		Enable support for IPPROTO_ICMP6 sockets.  These sockets are needed
		for application level support for sending ICMPv7 ECHO requests and
		receiving associated ICMPv6 ECHO replies.

config NET_ICMPv6_NEIGHBOR
	bool "Solicit destination addresses"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable logic to send ICMPv6 neighbor solicitation requests if
		the target IPv6 address mapping does not appear in the Neighbor
		table.

if NET_ICMPv6_NEIGHBOR

config ICMPv6_NEIGHBOR_MAXTRIES
	int "ICMPv6 neighbor solicitation retries"
	default 5
	---help---
		Send the Neighbor solicitation this number of times before giving
		up and deciding that the target IP6 address is non reachable.

config ICMPv6_NEIGHBOR_DELAYMSEC
	int "ICMPv6 neighbor re-solicit delay"
	default 20
	---help---
		Wait this number of milliseconds after sending the Neighbor
		Solicitation before checking if the IPv6 address mapping is present
		in the Neighbor Table.  This time should be related to the maximum
		round trip time on the network since it is basically the time from
		when an Neighbor Solicitation is sent until the Neighbor
		Advertisement is received.

endif # NET_ICMPv6_NEIGHBOR

config NET_ICMPv6_AUTOCONF
	bool "ICMPv6 auto-configuration"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable ioctl() logic that implements ICMPv6 auto configuration.
		ICMPv6 auto configuration is an alternative to DHCPv6 for obtaining
		an IPv6 address from a router.

if NET_ICMPv6_AUTOCONF

config ICMPv6_AUTOCONF_MAXTRIES
	int "ICMPv6 router solicitation retries"
	default 5
	---help---
		Send the Router solicitation this number of times before giving
		up and deciding that no router is going to provide an IP address.

config ICMPv6_AUTOCONF_DELAYMSEC
	int "ICMPv6 router re-solicit delay"
	default 20
	---help---
		Wait this number of milliseconds before re-sending the Router
		Solicitation.  This time should be related to the maximum
		round trip time on the network since it is basically the time from
		when an Router Solicitation is sent until the Router
		Advertisement is received.

endif # NET_ICMPv6_AUTOCONF

config NET_ICMPv6_ROUTER
	bool "Router Advertisement"
	default n
	---help---
		In a router-less environment, NuttX can be configured to provide a
		response to Router Solicitation messages and, hence, providing
		addressing to IPv6 nodes on the network.

if NET_ICMPv6_ROUTER

config NET_ICMPv6_ROUTER_MANUAL
	bool "Manual router prefix"
	default n
	---help---
		Select this to set the advertised router prefix manually. Otherwise, it
		will be derived from the device IPv6 address and prefix length set in
		the netdev structure.

if NET_ICMPv6_ROUTER_MANUAL

config NET_ICMPv6_PREFLEN
	int "Prefix length"
	default 64
	range 0 128
	---help---
		The length (in bits) of the IPv6 address prefix.  This is the number
		of MS bits under the network mask.  The default of 64 would
		correspond to a network mask of:

			0xffff:0xffff:0xffff:0xffff:0x0000:0x0000:0x0000:0x0000.
