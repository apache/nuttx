 *   Stateless auto-configuration exploits several other features in IPv6,
 *   including link-local addresses, multi-casting, the Neighbor Discovery

 *   address from the underlying link layer address. The general idea is
 *   to have a device generate a temporary address until it can determine
 *   the characteristics of the network it is on, and then create a permanent
 *   address it can use based on that information.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   dev   - The device driver structure to assign the address to
 *   psock - A pointer to a NuttX-specific, internal socket structure
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success; A negated errno value is returned on
 *   any failure.
