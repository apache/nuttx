 * Function: psock_local_sendto
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function implements the Unix domain-specific logic of the
 *   standard sendto() socket operation.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   psock    A pointer to a NuttX-specific, internal socket structure
 *   buf      Data to send
 *   len      Length of data to send
 *   flags    Send flags
 *   to       Address of recipient
 *   tolen    The length of the address structure
 *
 *   NOTE: All input parameters were verified by sendto() before this
 *   function was called.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, returns the number of characters sent.  On  error,
 *   a negated errno value is returned.  See the description in
 *   net/socket/sendto.c for the list of appropriate return value.
