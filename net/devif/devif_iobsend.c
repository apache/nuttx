 * Name: devif_iob_send
 *
 * Description:
 *   Called from socket logic in response to a xmit or poll request from the
 *   the network interface driver.
 *
 *   This is identical to calling devif_send() except that the data is
 *   in an I/O buffer chain, rather than a flat buffer.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   Called with the network locked.
