 * uIP provides the necessary protocols for Internet communication,
 * with a very small code footprint and RAM requirements - the uIP
 * code size is on the order of a few kilobytes and RAM usage is on
 * the order of a few hundred bytes.

/****************************************************************************
 * uIP is a small implementation of the IP, UDP and TCP protocols (as
 * well as some basic ICMP stuff). The implementation couples the IP,
 * UDP, TCP and the application layers very tightly. To keep the size
 * of the compiled code down, this code frequently uses the goto
 * statement. While it would be possible to break the ipv4_input()
 * function into many smaller functions, this would increase the code
 * size because of the overhead of parameter passing and the fact that
 * the optimizer would not be as efficient.
 *
 * The principle is that we have a small buffer, called the d_buf,
 * in which the device driver puts an incoming packet. The TCP/IP
 * stack parses the headers in the packet, and calls the
 * application. If the remote host has sent data to the application,
 * this data is present in the d_buf and the application read the
 * data from there. It is up to the application to put this data into
 * a byte stream if needed. The application will not be fed with data
 * that is out of sequence.
 *
 * If the application wishes to send data to the peer, it should put
 * its data into the d_buf. The d_appdata pointer points to the
 * first available byte. The TCP/IP stack will calculate the
 * checksums, and fill in the necessary header fields and finally send
 * the packet back to the peer.
