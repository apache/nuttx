	default n
	depends on WIRELESS_BLUETOOTH
	select NETDEV_IOCTL
	---help---
		Enable support for raw, Bluetooth sockets.

		Raw sockets allow receiving and transmitting Bluetooth radio
		frames without a layer2 protocol such as 6LoWPAN in between. Frames
		received are copied into a Bluetooth socket tap before they
		enter the network. Frames written into a Bluetooth socket will
		bypass the network altogether and will be sent directly to the
		Bluetooth MAC network interface driver outgoing frame queue.

	int "Max Bluetooth sockets"
	default 4

config NET_BLUETOOTH_NCONTAINERS
	int "Number of pre-allocated frame containers"
	default 8
	---help---
		This specifies the total number of preallocated frame containers.
		One must be allocated with each incoming frame.

config NET_BLUETOOTH_BACKLOG
	int "Maximum frame backlog"
	default 8
	range 0 255
	---help---
		As frames are received, then are help in an RX queue.  They remain
		in the RX queue until application logic reads the queue frames.  To
		prevent overrun, the maximum backlog may be set to a nonzero value.
		What the backlog of queue frames reaches that count, the olds frame
		will be freed, preventing overrun at the cost of losing the oldest
		frames.

		NOTE: The special value of zero will disable all backlog checks.
