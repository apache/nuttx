 * Name: neighbor_out
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function should be called before sending out an IPv6 packet. The
 *   function checks the destination IPv6 address of the IPv6 packet to see
 *   what L2 address that should be used as a destination L2 address.
 *
 *   If the destination IPv6 address is in the local network (determined
 *   by logical ANDing of netmask and our IPv6 address), the function
 *   checks the Neighbor Table to see if an entry for the destination IPv6
 *   address is found.  If so, an L2 header is pre-pended at the beginning
 *   of the packet and the function returns.
 *
 *   If no Neighbor Table entry is found for the destination IPv6 address,
 *   the packet in the d_buf is replaced by an ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicit
 *   request packet for the IPv6 address. The IPv6 packet is dropped and
 *   it is assumed that the higher level protocols (e.g., TCP) eventually
 *   will retransmit the dropped packet.
 *
 *   Upon return in either the case, a packet to be sent is present in the
 *   d_buf buffer and the d_len field holds the length of the L2 frame that
 *   should be transmitted.
