menuconfig NET_MLD
	bool "Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD)"
	default n
	select NET_MCASTGROUP
	select NETDEV_IFINDEX
	---help---
		Enable Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) support.

if NET_MLD

config NET_MLD_ROUTER
	bool "MLD Router support"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables a few hooks that will be needed for router support in the
		future. Use IPv6 multicast routers to discover the presence of multicast
		listeners (nodes configured to receive IPv6 multicast packets)
		on its directly attached links and to discover which multicast packets
		are of interest to neighboring nodes. All IPv6 multicast routers that
		run MLD on the same subnet can monitor MLD listener report messages
		(often called reports) from hosts. However, only one router can act as
		the MLD querier to send MLD query messages (often called queries).
		A querier election mechanism determines which router acts as the MLD
		querier on the subnet.

config NET_MLD_DEBUG
	bool "Force MLD debug"
	default n
	depends on DEBUG_ERROR
	---help---
		Normally, MLD debug output is controlled by CONFIG_DEBUG_NET_*.
		This option will force debug output from MLD files even if network
		debug is not enabled.  This feature does still depend on global
		debug output CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO, CONFIG_DEBUG_WARN, and
		CONFIG_DEBUG_ERROR.

config NET_MLD_TXDUMP
	bool "Enable TX Packet Dump"
	default n
	---help---
		Dump the content of all outgoing packets.
