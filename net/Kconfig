	bool
	default n

config NET
	bool "Networking support"
	default n
	select ARCH_HAVE_NET
	---help---
		Enable or disable all network features

if NET

config NET_NOINTS
	bool "Not interrupt driven"
	default n
	---help---
		NET_NOINT indicates that uIP is not called from the interrupt level.
		If NET_NOINTS is defined, critical sections will be managed with semaphores;
		Otherwise, it assumed that uIP will be called from interrupt level handling
		and critical sections will be managed by enabling and disabling interrupts.

config NET_MULTIBUFFER
	bool "Use multiple device-side I/O buffers"
	default n
	---help---
		Traditionally, uIP has used a single buffer for all incoming and
		outgoing traffic.  If this configuration is selected, then the
		driver can manage multiple I/O buffers and can, for example,
		be filling one input buffer while sending another output buffer.
		Or, as another example, the driver may support queuing of concurrent
		input/ouput and output transfers for better performance.

config NET_PROMISCUOUS
	bool "Promiscuous mode"
	default n
	---help---
		Force the Ethernet driver to operate in promiscuous mode (if supported
		by the Ethernet driver).

config NET_IPv6
	bool "IPv6"
	default n
	---help---
		Build in support for IPv6.  Not fully implemented.

config NSOCKET_DESCRIPTORS
	int "Number of socket descriptor"
	default 8
	---help---
		Maximum number of socket descriptors per task/thread.

config NET_NACTIVESOCKETS
	int "Max socket operations"
	default 16
	---help---
		Maximum number of concurrent socket operations (recv, send, etc.).
		Default: 16

config NET_SOCKOPTS
	bool "Socket options"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable or disable support for socket options

if NET_SOCKOPTS

config NET_SOLINGER
	bool "SO_LINGER socket option"

config NET_TCPURGDATA
	bool "Urgent data"

		compiled in. Urgent data (out-of-band data) is a rarely used TCP feature
		that is very seldom would be required.

	---help---
		Maximum number of listening TCP/IP ports (all tasks).  Default: 20

config NET_TCP_READAHEAD
	bool "Enabled TCP/IP read-ahead buffering"
	default y
	---help---
		Read-ahead buffers allows buffering of TCP/IP packets when there is no
		receive in place to catch the TCP packet.  In that case, the packet
		will be retained in the NuttX read-ahead buffers.

		You might want to disable TCP/IP read-ahead buffering on a highly
		memory constrained system that does not have any TCP/IP packet rate
		issues.

if NET_TCP_READAHEAD

config NET_TCP_READAHEAD_BUFSIZE
	int "TCP/IP read-ahead buffer size"
	default 562
	---help---
		Read-ahead buffers allows buffering of TCP/IP packets when there is no
		receive in place to catch the TCP packet.  In that case, the packet
		will be retained in the NuttX read-ahead buffers.

		This setting specifies the size of one TCP/IP read-ahead buffer.
		This should best be a equal to the maximum packet size (NET_BUFSIZE).

config NET_NTCP_READAHEAD_BUFFERS
	int "Number of TCP/IP read-ahead buffers"
	default 8
	---help---
		Read-ahead buffers allows buffering of TCP/IP packets when there is no
		receive in place to catch the TCP packet.  In that case, the packet
		will be retained in the NuttX read-ahead buffers.

		This setting specifies the number of TCP/IP read-ahead buffers.

config NET_TCP_WRITE_BUFFERS
	bool "Enabled TCP/IP write buffering"
	default n
	---help---
		Write buffers allows buffering of ongoing TCP/IP packets, providing
		for higher performance, streamed output.

		You might want to disable TCP/IP write buffering on a highly memory
		memory constrained system where there are no performance issues.

if NET_TCP_WRITE_BUFFERS

config NET_TCP_WRITE_BUFSIZE
	int "TCP/IP write buffer size"
	default 562
	---help---
		Write buffers allows buffering of ongoing TCP/IP packets, providing
		for higher performance, streamed output.

		This setting specifies the size of one TCP/IP write buffer. This
		should best be a equal to the maximum packet size (NET_BUFSIZE).

config NET_NTCP_WRITE_BUFFERS
	int "Number of TCP/IP write buffers"
	default 8
	---help---
		Write buffers allows buffering of ongoing TCP/IP packets, providing
		for higher performance, streamed output.

		This setting specifies the number of TCP/IP write buffers.

endif # NET_TCP_WRITE_BUFFERS

config NET_TCP_RECVDELAY
	int "TCP Rx delay"
	default 0
	---help---
		If NET_TCP_READAHEAD_BUFFERS is undefined, then there will be no buffering
		of TCP/IP packets:  Any TCP/IP packet received will be ACKed, but its contents
		will be dropped in the bit-bucket.

		One low-performance option is delay for a short period of time after a
		TCP/IP packet is received to see if another comes right behind it. Then
		the packet data from both can be combined.  This option only makes since
		if performance is not an issue and you need to handle short bursts of
		small, back-to-back packets.  The delay is in units of deciseconds.

config NET_TCPBACKLOG
	bool "TCP/IP backlog support"
	default n
	---help---
		Incoming connections pend in a backlog until accept() is called.
		The size of the backlog is selected when listen() is called.

config NET_TCP_SPLIT
	bool "Enable packet splitting"
	default n
	depends on !NET_TCP_WRITE_BUFFERS
	---help---
		send() will not return until the transfer has been ACKed by the
		recipient.  But under RFC 1122, the host need not ACK each packet
		immediately; the host may wait for 500 MS before ACKing.  This
		combination can cause very slow performance with small transfers are
		made to an RFC 1122 client.  However, the RFC 1122 must ACK at least
		every second (odd) packet.

		This option enables logic to trick the RFC 1122 host be exploiting
		this last RFC 1122 requirement:  If an odd number of packets were to
		be sent, then send() will split the last even packet to guarantee
		that an even number of packets will be sent and the RFC 1122 host
		will ACK the final packet immediately.

if NET_TCP_SPLIT

config NET_TCP_SPLIT_SIZE
	int "Split size threshold"
	default 40
	---help---
		Packets of this size or smaller than this will not be split.

config NET_BROADCAST
	bool "UDP broadcast Rx support"
	default n
	---help---
		Incoming UDP broadcast support

config NET_RXAVAIL
	bool "Driver-based UDP backlog"
	default n
	---help---
		One problem with UDP communications is that, unlike TCP/IP, there is
		no backlog of UDP packets.  So if you are listening at the precise
		moment that the UDP packet is sent, it will not be received.  This
		is not incompatible with the properties of UDP, but can result in
		bad performance if packets are missed, time out, and are resent.

		Some Ethernet controllers have built-in RAM and the drivers can
		support retention of UDP packets in that RAM.  If the drivers
		supports such a capability, this option may be enabled to use it.
		NOTE:  If this option is enabled, the driver must support the
		rxavail() method in the uip_driver_s structure.

config NET_ICMP
	bool "ICMP networking support"

	bool "Collect network statistics"
	default n
	---help---
		uIP statistics on or off

config NET_RECEIVE_WINDOW
	int "Receive window size"
	default 562
	---help---
		The size of the advertised receiver's window.   Should be set low
		(i.e., to the size of the NET_BUFSIZE) if the application is slow
		to process incoming data, or high (32768 bytes) if the application
		processes data quickly.

config NET_ARPTAB_SIZE
	int "ARP table size"
	default 16
	---help---
		The size of the ARP table (in entries).

config NET_ARP_IPIN
	bool "ARP address harvesting"

config NET_SLIP
	bool "SLIP support"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables building of the SLIP driver. SLIP requires
		at least one IP protocol selected and the following additional
		network settings: NET_NOINTS and NET_MULTIBUFFER.

		NET_BUFSIZE *must* be set to 296.  Other optional configuration
		settings that affect the SLIP driver: NET_STATISTICS.
		Default: Ethernet

		SLIP supports point-to-point IP communications over a serial port.
		The default data link layer for uIP is Ethernet. If NET_SLIP is
		defined in the NuttX configuration file, then SLIP will be supported.
		The basic differences between the SLIP and Ethernet configurations is
		that when SLIP is selected:
		
		* The link level header (that comes before the IP header) is omitted.
		* All MAC address processing is suppressed.
		* ARP is disabled.
		
		If NET_SLIP is not selected, then Ethernet will be used (there is
		no need to define anything special in the configuration file to use
		Ethernet -- it is the default).
