		Packet buffer size.  This size includes the TCP/UDP payload plus the
		size of TCP/UDP header, the IP header, and the Ethernet header.
		This value is related to the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit), except
		that it includes the size of the link layer header; the payload is
		the MSS (Maximum Segment Size).

		IPv4 hosts are required to be able to handle an MSS of at least
		536 octets, resulting in a minimum buffer size of 536+20+20+14 =
		590.

		IPv6 hosts are required to be able to handle an MSS of 1220 octets,
		resulting in a minimum buffer size of 1220+20+40+14 = 1294

		To get an MTU of 1500, for example, you would need packet buffer of
		size 1514.

config NET_SLIP_PKTSIZE
	int "SLIP packet buffer size"
	default 296
	depends on NET_SLIP
	range 296 1518
	---help---
		Provides the size of the SLIP packet buffers.  This size includes
		the TCP/UDP payload plus the size of TCP/UDP header and the IP header.
		This value is related to the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit), except
		that it includes the size of the link layer header; the payload is
		the MSS (Maximum Segment Size).  SLIP has no link layer header so for
		SLIP the MTU is the same as the PKTSIZE.

		SLIP is required to support at least 256+20+20 = 296.  Values other than
		296 are not recommended.

		The Linux slip module hard-codes its MTU size to 296 (40 bytes for
		the IP+TCP headers plus 256 bytes of data).  So you might as well
		set CONFIG_NET_SLIP_PKTSIZE to 296 as well.

		There may be an issue with this setting, however.  I see that Linux
		uses a MTU of 296 and window of 256, but actually only sends 168
		bytes of data: 40 + 128.  I believe that is to allow for the 2x
		worst cast packet expansion.  Ideally we would like to advertise the
		256 MSS, but restrict transfers to 128 bytes (possibly by modifying
		the MSS value in the TCP connection structure).

config NET_GUARDSIZE
	int "Driver I/O guard size"
	default 2
	---help---
		Network drivers often receive packets with garbage at the end and
		are longer than the size of packet in the TCP header.  The following
		"fudge" factor increases the size of the I/O buffering by a small
		amount to allocate slightly oversize packets.  After receipt, the
		packet size will be chopped down to the size indicated in the TCP
		header.

config NET_RECV_BUFSIZE
	int "Net Receive buffer size"
	default 0
	---help---
		This is the default value for receive buffer size.

	default y
	---help---
		If NET_SLIP is not selected, then Ethernet will be used (there is
		no need to define anything special in the configuration file to use
		Ethernet -- it is the default).

config NET_LOOPBACK
	bool "Local loopback"
	select ARCH_HAVE_NETDEV_STATISTICS
	default n
	---help---
		Add support for the local network loopback device, lo.

config NET_LOOPBACK_PKTSIZE
	int "Loopback packet buffer size"
	default 0
	depends on NET_LOOPBACK
	range 0 65535
	---help---
		The loopback driver packet buffer should be quite large.  The larger
		the loopback packet buffer, the better will be TCP performance of
		the loopback transfers.  The Linux loopback device historically used
		packet buffers of size 16Kb, but that was increased in recent Linux
		versions to 64Kb.  Those sizes may be excessive for resource
		constrained MCUs, however.

		The network enforces a lower limit that is the maximum packet size
		of all enabled link layer protocols.  The default value of
		CONFIG_NET_LOOPBACK_PKTSIZE is zero, meaning that this maximum
		packet size will be used by loopback driver.

menuconfig NET_MBIM

menuconfig NET_SLIP
	bool "SLIP support"
	select ARCH_HAVE_NETDEV_STATISTICS
	default n
	---help---
		Enables building of the SLIP driver. SLIP requires
		at least one IP protocol selected.

		SLIP supports point-to-point IP communications over a serial port.
		The default link layer for network layer is Ethernet. If NET_SLIP
		is defined in the NuttX configuration file, then SLIP will be
		supported.  The basic differences between the SLIP and Ethernet
		configurations is that when SLIP is selected:

			* The link level header (that comes before the IP header) is omitted.
			* All MAC address processing is suppressed.
			* ARP is disabled.

		If NET_SLIP is not selected, then Ethernet will be used (there is
		no need to define anything special in the configuration file to use
		Ethernet -- it is the default).

config NET_TUN_PKTSIZE

		Provides the size of the TUN packet buffers.  This size includes
		the TCP/UDP payload plus the size of TCP/UDP header and the IP header.
		This value is related to the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit), except
		that it includes the size of the link layer header; the payload is
		the MSS (Maximum Segment Size).  TUN has no link layer header so for
		TUN the MTU is the same as the PKTSIZE.

config NETDEV_LATEINIT
	bool "Late driver initialization"
	default n
	---help---
		Normally, networking initialization occur in the later phase of the
		boot process in the function up_initialize() when it calls the
		driver initialization function, up_netinitialize().  This
		initialization occurs after a sufficient about of the OS has been
		initialized so that driver registration can be performed, but
		before the completion of OS initialization and before the first
		application is started.

		In a few situations, however, you may want to suppress this early
		network driver initialization.  As examples:

			- If you are using SLIP or PPPD, then there will be no network
			  driver to be initialized,
			- Certain multi-network configurations where a simple call to
			  up_netinitialize() may be insufficient, and
			- Situations where there are other board-level hardware
			  dependencies so that the hardware is not in an appropriate
			  state for up_netinitialize() to be called.

		Examples of this latter situation includes such things as network
		drivers that required some setup via an I2C I/O expander, or network
		drivers that depend on USB, SPI, I2C, PCI, serial, or other
		interfaces that may not be ready when up_netinitialize() is normally
		called.
