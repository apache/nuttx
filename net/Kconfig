	---help---
		Packet buffer size.  This size includes the TCP/UDP payload plus the
		size of TCP/UDP header, the IP header, and the Ethernet header.
		This value is normally referred to as the MTU (Maximum Transmission
		Unit); the payload is the MSS (Maximum Segment Size).

		IPv4 hosts are required to be able to handle an MSS of at least
		536 octets, resulting in a minimum buffer size of 536+20+20+14 =
		590.

		IPv6 hosts are required to be able to handle an MSS of 1220 octets,
		resulting in a minimum buffer size of of 1220+20+40+14 = 1294

	default 1220 if NET_IPv6
	default 536 if !NET_IPv6
	depends on NET_ETHERNET && NET_TCP
	---help---
		The size of the advertised receiver's window.   Should be set low
		(i.e., to the size of the MSS) if the application is slow to process
		incoming data, or high (32768 bytes) if the application processes
		data quickly.

config NET_SLIP_MTU
	int # "SLIP packet buffer size (MTU)"
	default 296
	depends on NET_SLIP
	range 296 1518
	---help---
		Provides the size of the SLIP packet buffers.  This size includes
		the TCP/UDP payload plus the size of TCP/UDP header and the IP header.
		This value is normally referred to as the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit);
		the payload payload is the MSS (Maximum Segment Size).

		SLIP is required to support at lest 256+20+20 = 296.  Values other than
		296 are not recommended.

		The Linux slip module hard-codes its MTU size to 296 (40 bytes for
		the IP+TPC headers plus 256 bytes of data).  So you might as well
		set CONFIG_NET_SLIP_MTU to 296 as well.

		There may be an issue with this setting, however.  I see that Linux
		uses a MTU of 296 and window of 256, but actually only sends 168
		bytes of data: 40 + 128.  I believe that is to allow for the 2x
		worst cast packet expansion.  Ideally we would like to advertise the
		256 MSS, but restrict transfers to 128 bytes (possibly by modifying
		the MSS value in the TCP connection structure).


config NET_SLIP_TCP_RECVWNDO
	int "SLIP TCP receive window size"
	default 256
	depends on NET_SLIP && NET_TCP
	---help---
		The size of the advertised receiver's window.   Should be set low
		(i.e., to the size of the MSS) if the application is slow to process
		incoming data, or high (32768 bytes) if the application processes
		data quickly.

config NET_GUARDSIZE
	int "Driver I/O guard size"
	default 2
	---help---
		Network drivers often receive packets with garbage at the end and
		are longer than the size of packet in the TCP header.  The following
		"fudge" factor increases the size of the I/O buffering by a small
		amount to allocate slightly oversize packets.  After receipt, the
		packet size will be chopped down to the size indicated in the TCP
		header.

menuconfig NET_SLIP
	bool "SLIP support"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables building of the SLIP driver. SLIP requires
		at least one IP protocol selected.

		SLIP supports point-to-point IP communications over a serial port.
		The default data link layer for network layer is Ethernet. If
		NET_SLIP is defined in the NuttX configuration file, then SLIP will
		be supported.  The basic differences between the SLIP and Ethernet
		configurations is that when SLIP is selected:

			* The link level header (that comes before the IP header) is omitted.
			* All MAC address processing is suppressed.
			* ARP is disabled.

		If NET_SLIP is not selected, then Ethernet will be used (there is
		no need to define anything special in the configuration file to use
		Ethernet -- it is the default).

		Enable or disable user-space networking stack support.

		User-space networking stack API allows user-space daemon to
		provide TCP/IP stack implementation for NuttX network.

		Main use for this is to allow use and integration of
		HW-provided TCP/IP stacks for NuttX.

		For example, user-space daemon can translate /dev/usrsock API
		requests to HW TCP/IP API requests while rest of the user-space
		can access standard socket API, with socket descriptors that
		can be used with NuttX system calls.
