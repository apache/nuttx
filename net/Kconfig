config NET_NOINTS
	bool "Not interrupt driven"
	default n
	---help---
		NET_NOINT indicates that uIP is not called from the interrupt level.
		If NET_NOINTS is defined, critical sections will be managed with semaphores;
		Otherwise, it assumed that uIP will be called from interrupt level handling
		and critical sections will be managed by enabling and disabling interrupts.

config NET_MULTIBUFFER
	bool "Use multiple device-side I/O buffers"
	default n
	---help---
		Traditionally, uIP has used a single buffer for all incoming and
		outgoing traffic.  If this configuration is selected, then the
		driver can manage multiple I/O buffers and can, for example,
		be filling one input buffer while sending another output buffer.
		Or, as another example, the driver may support queuing of concurrent
		input/ouput and output transfers for better performance.

config NET_PROMISCUOUS
	bool "Promiscuous mode"
	default n
	---help---
		Force the Ethernet driver to operate in promiscuous mode (if supported
		by the Ethernet driver).

config NET_IPv6
	bool "IPv6"
	default n
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
		Build in support for IPv6.  Not fully implemented.

config NSOCKET_DESCRIPTORS
	int "Number of socket descriptor"
	default 8
	---help---
		Maximum number of socket descriptors per task/thread.

config NET_NACTIVESOCKETS
	int "Max socket operations"
	default 16
	---help---
		Maximum number of concurrent socket operations (recv, send, etc.).
		Default: 16

config NET_SOCKOPTS

	---help---
		Packet buffer size.  This size includes the TCP/UDP payload plus the
		size of TCP/UDP header, the IP header, and the Ethernet header
		(assuming that the Ethernet transport is used).  This value is
		normally referred to as the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit); the
		payload is the MSS (Maximum Segment Size).

		IPv4 hosts are required to be able to handle an MSS of at least
		536 octets, resulting in a minimum buffer size of 536+20+20+14 =
		590 (For SLIP 256+20+20 = 296).

		IPv6 hosts are required to be able to handle an MSS of 1220 octets,
		resulting in a minimum buffer size of of 1220+20+40+14 = 1294

config NET_TCPURGDATA
	bool "Urgent data"
	default n
	---help---
		Determines if support for TCP urgent data notification should be
		compiled in. Urgent data (out-of-band data) is a rarely used TCP feature
		that is very seldom would be required.

		Maximum number of TCP/IP connections (all tasks)

config NET_MAX_LISTENPORTS

	default 20
	---help---
		Maximum number of listening TCP/IP ports (all tasks).  Default: 20

config NET_TCP_READAHEAD
	bool "Enable TCP/IP read-ahead buffering"
	default y
	---help---
		Read-ahead buffers allows buffering of TCP/IP packets when there is no
		receive in place to catch the TCP packet.  In that case, the packet
		will be retained in the NuttX read-ahead buffers.

		You might want to disable TCP/IP read-ahead buffering on a highly
		memory constrained system that does not have any TCP/IP packet rate
		issues.

	default 256 if NET_SLIP && !NET_IPv6
	---help---
		Read-ahead buffers allows buffering of TCP/IP packets when there is no
		receive in place to catch the TCP packet.  In that case, the packet
		will be retained in the NuttX read-ahead buffers.

		This setting specifies the size of one TCP/IP read-ahead buffer.
		This should best be a equal to the maximum packet payload size (MSS).

		Optimally, the size of the read-ahead buffer will should the maximum
		size of an incoming TCP packet payload (MSS).  This MSS value is
		determined by NET_BUFSIZE minus the size of TCP, IP, and Ethernet
		headers (assuming you are using the Ethernet transport).  IPv4 hosts
		are required to be able to handle an MSS of 536 octets and IPv6 hosts
		are required to be able to handle an MSS of 1220 octets.

config NET_NTCP_READAHEAD_BUFFERS
	int "Number of TCP/IP read-ahead buffers"
	default 8
	---help---
		Read-ahead buffers allows buffering of TCP/IP packets when there is no

config NET_TCP_WRITE_BUFFERS
	bool "Enable TCP/IP write buffering"
	default n
	---help---
		Write buffers allows buffering of ongoing TCP/IP packets, providing

		memory constrained system where there are no performance issues.

	default 256 if NET_SLIP && !NET_IPv6
	---help---
		Write buffers allows buffering of ongoing TCP/IP packets, providing
		for higher performance, streamed output.

		The size of the write buffer will determine the maximum size of an
		outgoing TCP packet payload (MSS).  This value should NOT exceed the
		maximum MSS which is determined by NET_BUFSIZE minus the size of
		TCP, IP, and Ethernet headers (assuming you are using the Ethernet
		transport).   IPv4 hosts are required to be able to handle an MSS
		of 536 octets and IPv6 hosts are required to be able to handle an
		MSS of 1220 octets.

		This setting specifies the size of one TCP/IP write buffer. This
		should best be a equal to the maximum packet size (NET_BUFSIZE).

config NET_NTCP_WRITE_BUFFERS
	int "Number of TCP/IP write buffers"
	default 8
	---help---
		Write buffers allows buffering of ongoing TCP/IP packets, providing
		for higher performance, streamed output.

		This setting specifies the number of TCP/IP write buffers.

endif # NET_TCP_WRITE_BUFFERS

config NET_TCP_RECVDELAY
	int "TCP Rx delay"
	default 0
	---help---
		If NET_TCP_READAHEAD_BUFFERS is undefined, then there will be no buffering
		of TCP/IP packets:  Any TCP/IP packet received will be ACKed, but its contents
		will be dropped in the bit-bucket.

		One low-performance option is delay for a short period of time after a
		TCP/IP packet is received to see if another comes right behind it. Then
		the packet data from both can be combined.  This option only makes since
		if performance is not an issue and you need to handle short bursts of
		small, back-to-back packets.  The delay is in units of deciseconds.

config NET_TCPBACKLOG
	bool "TCP/IP backlog support"
	default n
	---help---
		Incoming connections pend in a backlog until accept() is called.
		The size of the backlog is selected when listen() is called.

config NET_TCP_SPLIT
	bool "Enable packet splitting"
	default n
	depends on !NET_TCP_WRITE_BUFFERS
	---help---
		send() will not return until the transfer has been ACKed by the
		recipient.  But under RFC 1122, the host need not ACK each packet
		immediately; the host may wait for 500 MS before ACKing.  This
		combination can cause very slow performance with small transfers are
		made to an RFC 1122 client.  However, the RFC 1122 must ACK at least
		every second (odd) packet.

		This option enables logic to trick the RFC 1122 host be exploiting
		this last RFC 1122 requirement:  If an odd number of packets were to
		be sent, then send() will split the last even packet to guarantee
		that an even number of packets will be sent and the RFC 1122 host
		will ACK the final packet immediately.

config NET_BROADCAST
	bool "UDP broadcast Rx support"
	default n
	---help---
		Incoming UDP broadcast support

config NET_RXAVAIL
	bool "Driver-based UDP backlog"
	default n
	---help---
		One problem with UDP communications is that, unlike TCP/IP, there is
		no backlog of UDP packets.  So if you are listening at the precise
		moment that the UDP packet is sent, it will not be received.  This
		is not incompatible with the properties of UDP, but can result in
		bad performance if packets are missed, time out, and are resent.

		Some Ethernet controllers have built-in RAM and the drivers can
		support retention of UDP packets in that RAM.  If the drivers
		supports such a capability, this option may be enabled to use it.
		NOTE:  If this option is enabled, the driver must support the
		rxavail() method in the uip_driver_s structure.

config NET_ICMP

		The size of the advertised receiver's window.   Should be set low
		(i.e., to the size of the MSS) if the application is slow to process
		incoming data, or high (32768 bytes) if the application processes
		data quickly.

	default n
	---help---

config NET_SLIP
	bool "SLIP support"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables building of the SLIP driver. SLIP requires
		at least one IP protocol selected and the following additional
		network settings: NET_NOINTS and NET_MULTIBUFFER.

		NET_BUFSIZE *must* be set to 296.  Other optional configuration
		settings that affect the SLIP driver: NET_STATISTICS.
		Default: Ethernet

		SLIP supports point-to-point IP communications over a serial port.
		The default data link layer for uIP is Ethernet. If NET_SLIP is
		defined in the NuttX configuration file, then SLIP will be supported.
		The basic differences between the SLIP and Ethernet configurations is
		that when SLIP is selected:

			* The link level header (that comes before the IP header) is omitted.
			* All MAC address processing is suppressed.
			* ARP is disabled.

		If NET_SLIP is not selected, then Ethernet will be used (there is
		no need to define anything special in the configuration file to use
		Ethernet -- it is the default).
