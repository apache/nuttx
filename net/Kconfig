		Enable or disable all network features

config NET_NOINTS
	bool "Not interrupt driven"
	default n
	---help---
		NET_NOINT indicates that uIP is not called from the interrupt level.
		If NET_NOINTS is defined, critical sections will be managed with semaphores;
		Otherwise, it assumed that uIP will be called from interrupt level handling
		and critical sections will be managed by enabling and disabling interrupts.

config NET_PROMISCUOUS
	bool "Promiscuous mode"
	default n
	---help---
		Force the Ethernet driver to operate in promiscuous mode (if supported
		by the Ethernet driver).

config NET_MULTIBUFFER
	bool "Use multiple device-side I/O buffers"
	default n
	---help---
		Traditionally, uIP has used a single buffer for all incoming and
		outgoing traffic.  If this configuration is selected, then the
		driver can manage multiple I/O buffers and can, for example,
		be filling one input buffer while sending another output buffer.
		Or, as another example, the driver may support queuing of concurrent
		input/ouput and output transfers for better performance.

config NET_ETH_MTU
	int "Ethernet packet buffer size (MTU)"
	default 1294 if NET_IPv6
	default 590 if !NET_IPv6
	depends on NET_ETHERNET
	range 590 1518
	---help---
		Packet buffer size.  This size includes the TCP/UDP payload plus the
		size of TCP/UDP header, the IP header, and the Ethernet header.
		This value is normally referred to as the MTU (Maximum Transmission
		Unit); the payload is the MSS (Maximum Segment Size).

		IPv4 hosts are required to be able to handle an MSS of at least
		536 octets, resulting in a minimum buffer size of 536+20+20+14 =
		590.

		IPv6 hosts are required to be able to handle an MSS of 1220 octets,
		resulting in a minimum buffer size of of 1220+20+40+14 = 1294

config NET_ETH_TCP_RECVWNDO
	int "Ethernet TCP receive window size"
	default 1220 if NET_IPv6
	default 536 if !NET_IPv6
	depends on NET_ETHERNET && NET_TCP
	---help---
		The size of the advertised receiver's window.   Should be set low
		(i.e., to the size of the MSS) if the application is slow to process
		incoming data, or high (32768 bytes) if the application processes
		data quickly.

config NET_SLIP_MTU
	int # "SLIP packet buffer size (MTU)"
	default 296
	depends on NET_SLIP
	range 296 1518
	---help---
		Packet buffer size.  This size includes the TCP/UDP payload plus the
		size of TCP/UDP header and the IP header.  This value is normally
		referred to as the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit); the payload
		payload is the MSS (Maximum Segment Size).  SLIP is required to
		support at lest 256+20+20 = 296.  Values other than 296 are not
		recommended.

config NET_SLIP_TCP_RECVWNDO
	int "SLIP TCP receive window size"
	default 256
	depends on NET_SLIP && NET_TCP
	---help---
		The size of the advertised receiver's window.   Should be set low
		(i.e., to the size of the MSS) if the application is slow to process
		incoming data, or high (32768 bytes) if the application processes
		data quickly.

config NET_GUARDSIZE
	int "Driver I/O guard size"
	default 2
	---help---
		Network drivers often receive packets with garbage at the end and
		are longer than the size of packet in the TCP header.  The following
		"fudge" factor increases the size of the I/O buffering by a small
		amount to allocate slightly oversize packets.  After receipt, the
		packet size will be chopped down to the size indicated in the TCP
		header.

	default n if NET_SLIP
	select NETDEV_MULTINIC if NET_SLIP
	select NET_MULTILINK if NET_SLIP
	---help---
		If NET_SLIP is not selected, then Ethernet will be used (there is
		no need to define anything special in the configuration file to use
		Ethernet -- it is the default).

config NET_SLIP
	bool "SLIP support"
	default n
	select NETDEV_MULTINIC if NET_ETHERNET
	select NET_MULTILINK if NET_ETHERNET
	---help---
		Enables building of the SLIP driver. SLIP requires
		at least one IP protocol selected and the following additional
		network settings: NET_NOINTS and NET_MULTIBUFFER.

		SLIP supports point-to-point IP communications over a serial port.
		The default data link layer for uIP is Ethernet. If NET_SLIP is
		defined in the NuttX configuration file, then SLIP will be supported.
		The basic differences between the SLIP and Ethernet configurations is
		that when SLIP is selected:

			* The link level header (that comes before the IP header) is omitted.
			* All MAC address processing is suppressed.
			* ARP is disabled.

		If NET_SLIP is not selected, then Ethernet will be used (there is
		no need to define anything special in the configuration file to use
		Ethernet -- it is the default).

config SLIP_NINTERFACES
	int "Number of SLIP interfaces"
	default 1
	---help---
		Selects the number of physical SLIP
		interfaces to support.

config SLIP_STACKSIZE
	int "SLIP stack size"
	default 2048
	---help---
		Select the stack size of the SLIP RX and TX tasks.  Default: 2048

	int "SLIP priority"
