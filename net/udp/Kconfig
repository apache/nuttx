config NET_UDP
	bool "UDP Networking"
	default n
	depends on NET
	---help---
		Enable or disable UDP networking support.

config NET_UDP_NO_STACK
	bool "Disable UDP/IP Stack"
	default n
	select NET_UDP
	---help---
		Build without UDP/IP stack even if UDP networking support enabled.

if NET_UDP && !NET_UDP_NO_STACK

config NET_UDP_BINDTODEVICE
	bool "UDP Bind-to-device support"
	default n
	select NET_UDPPROTO_OPTIONS
	select NETDEV_IFINDEX
	---help---
		Enable support for the UDP_BINDTODEVICE socket option.
		Linux has SO_BINDTODEVICE but in NuttX this option is instead
		specific to the UDP protocol.

config NET_UDP_CHECKSUMS
	bool "UDP checksums"
	default y if NET_IPv6
	default n if !NET_IPv6
	---help---
		Enable/disable UDP checksum support.  UDP checksum support is
		REQUIRED for IPv6.

config NET_UDP_CONNS
	int "Number of UDP sockets"
	default 8
	---help---
		The maximum amount of open concurrent UDP sockets

config NET_BROADCAST
	bool "UDP broadcast Rx support"
	default n
	---help---
		Incoming UDP broadcast support

config NET_UDP_READAHEAD
	bool "Enable UDP/IP read-ahead buffering"
	default y
	select NET_READAHEAD
	select MM_IOB

config NET_UDP_WRITE_BUFFERS
	bool "Enable UDP/IP write buffering"
	default n
	select NET_WRITE_BUFFERS
	select MM_IOB
	---help---
		Write buffers allows buffering of ongoing UDP/IP packets, providing
		for higher performance, streamed output.

		You might want to disable UDP/IP write buffering on a highly memory
		memory constrained system where there are no performance issues.

if NET_UDP_WRITE_BUFFERS

config NET_UDP_NWRBCHAINS
	int "Number of pre-allocated I/O buffer chain heads"
	default 8
	---help---
		These tiny nodes are used as "containers" to support queuing of
		UDP write buffers.  This setting will limit the number of UDP write
		operations that can be "in-flight" at any give time.  So a good
		choice for this value would be the same as the maximum number of
		UDP connections.

config NET_UDP_WRBUFFER_DEBUG
	bool "Force write buffer debug"
	default n
	depends on DEBUG_FEATURES
	select IOB_DEBUG
	---help---
		This option will force debug output from UDP write buffer logic,
		even without network debug output.  This is not normally something
		that would want to do but is convenient if you are debugging the
		write buffer logic and do not want to get overloaded with other
		network-related debug output.

config NET_UDP_WRBUFFER_DUMP
	bool "Force write buffer dump"
	default n
	depends on DEBUG_NET || NET_UDP_WRBUFFER_DEBUG
	select IOB_DEBUG
	---help---
		Dump the contents of the write buffers.  You do not want to do this
		unless you really want to analyze the write buffer transfers in
		detail.
