 * Description:
 *   Handle incoming UDP input
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   dev   - The device driver structure containing the received UDP packet
 *   udp   - A pointer to the UDP header in the packet
 *   iplen - Length of the IP and UDP headers
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK     - The packet has been processed  and can be deleted
 *  -EAGAIN - Hold the packet and try again later.  There is a listening
 *            socket but no receive in place to catch the packet yet.  The
 *            device's d_len will be set to zero in this case as there is
 *            no outgoing data.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   The network is locked.
