config NET_PREALLOC_DEVIF_CALLBACKS
	int "Preallocated socket callbacks"
	default 16 if !DEFAULT_SMALL
	default 4 if DEFAULT_SMALL
	---help---
		Number of preallocated socket callbacks (all tasks).

		This number of callbacks will be pre-allocated during system boot.
		If dynamic callbacks allocation is enabled, more callbacks may be
		allocated at a later time, as the system needs them. Else this
		will be the maximum number of callbacks available to the system
		at all times.

		Set to 0 to disable (and rely only on dynamic allocations).

config NET_ALLOC_DEVIF_CALLBACKS
	int "Dynamic socket callbacks allocation"
	default 0
	---help---
		Dynamic memory allocations for socket callbacks.

		When set to 0 all dynamic allocations are disabled.

		When set to 1 a new callback will be allocated every time, and
		it will be free'd when no longer needed.

		Setting this to 2 or more will allocate the callbacks in batches
		(with batch size equal to this config). When a callback is no
		longer needed, it will be returned to the free callbacks pool,
		and it will never be deallocated!

config NET_SOCKOPTS
	bool "Socket options"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable or disable support for socket options

config NET_TCPPROTO_OPTIONS
	bool "TCP proto socket options"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable or disable support for TCP protocol level socket options.

config NET_UDPPROTO_OPTIONS
	bool
	default n
	---help---
		Enable or disable support for UDP protocol level socket options.

config NET_CANPROTO_OPTIONS
	bool
	default n
	---help---
		Enable or disable support for CAN protocol level socket option

if NET_SOCKOPTS

config NET_SOLINGER
	bool "SO_LINGER socket option"
	default n
	depends on NET_TCP_WRITE_BUFFERS || NET_UDP_WRITE_BUFFERS
	select NET_UDP_NOTIFIER if NET_UDP && !NET_UDP_NO_STACK
	---help---
		Enable or disable support for the SO_LINGER socket option.  Requires
		write buffer support.

config NET_TIMESTAMP
	bool "SO_TIMESTAMP socket option"
	default n
	depends on NET_CAN
	---help---
		Enable or disable support for the SO_TIMESTAMP socket option. Currently only tested & implemented in SocketCAN but should work on all sockets

config NET_BINDTODEVICE
	bool "SO_BINDTODEVICE socket option Bind-to-device support"
	default n
	select NETDEV_IFINDEX
	---help---
		Enable support for the NET_BINDTODEVICE socket option.
		Linux has SO_BINDTODEVICE but in NuttX this option is instead
		specific to the UDP protocol.
