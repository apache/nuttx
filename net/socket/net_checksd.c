 * Description:
 *   Check if the socket descriptor is valid for the provided TCB and if it
 *   supports the requested access.  This trivial operation is part of the
 *   fdopen() operation when the fdopen() is performed on a socket descriptor.
 *   It simply performs some sanity checking before permitting the socket
 *   descriptor to be wrapped as a C FILE stream.
 *
