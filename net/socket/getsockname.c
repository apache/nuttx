 * Name: psock_getsockname
 *
 * Description:
 *   The psock_getsockname() function retrieves the locally-bound name of the
 *   specified socket, stores this address in the sockaddr structure pointed
 *   to by the 'addr' argument, and stores the length of this address in the
 *   object pointed to by the 'addrlen' argument.
 *
 *   If the actual length of the address is greater than the length of the
 *   supplied sockaddr structure, the stored address will be truncated.
 *
 *   If the socket has not been bound to a local name, the value stored in
 *   the object pointed to by address is unspecified.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   psock    Socket structure of socket to operate on
 *   addr     sockaddr structure to receive data [out]
 *   addrlen  Length of sockaddr structure [in/out]
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, 0 is returned, the 'addr' argument points to the address
 *   of the socket, and the 'addrlen' argument points to the length of the
 *   address. Otherwise, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the
 *   error. Possible errno values that may be returned include:
 *
 *   EBADF      - The socket argument is not a valid file descriptor.
 *   ENOTSOCK   - The socket argument does not refer to a socket.
 *   EOPNOTSUPP - The operation is not supported for this socket's protocol.
 *   EINVAL     - The socket has been shut down.
 *   ENOBUFS    - Insufficient resources were available in the system to
 *                complete the function.
