 * Name: psock_recvfrom
 *
 * Description:
 *   psock_recvfrom() receives messages from a socket, and may be used to
 *   receive data on a socket whether or not it is connection-oriented.
 *   This is an internal OS interface.  It is functionally equivalent to
 *   recvfrom() except that:
 *
 *   - It is not a cancellation point,
 *   - It does not modify the errno variable, and
 *   - I accepts the internal socket structure as an input rather than an
 *     task-specific socket descriptor.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   psock   - A pointer to a NuttX-specific, internal socket structure
 *   buf     - Buffer to receive data
 *   len     - Length of buffer
 *   flags   - Receive flags
 *   from    - Address of source (may be NULL)
 *   fromlen - The length of the address structure
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, returns the number of characters sent.  If no data is
 *   available to be received and the peer has performed an orderly shutdown,
 *   recv() will return 0.  Otherwise, on any failure, a negated errno value
 *   is returned (see comments with send() for a list of appropriate errno
 *   values).

 * Name: recvfrom
 *
 * Description:
 *   recvfrom() receives messages from a socket, and may be used to receive
 *   data on a socket whether or not it is connection-oriented.
 *
 *   If from is not NULL, and the underlying protocol provides the source
 *   address, this source address is filled in. The argument fromlen
 *   initialized to the size of the buffer associated with from, and modified
 *   on return to indicate the actual size of the address stored there.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   sockfd  - Socket descriptor of socket
 *   buf     - Buffer to receive data
 *   len     - Length of buffer
 *   flags   - Receive flags
 *   from    - Address of source (may be NULL)
 *   fromlen - The length of the address structure
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, returns the number of characters received.  On  error,
 *   -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately:
 *
 *   EAGAIN
 *     The socket is marked non-blocking and the receive operation would
 *     block, or a receive timeout had been set and the timeout expired
 *     before data was received.
 *   EBADF
 *     The argument sockfd is an invalid descriptor.
 *   ECONNREFUSED
 *     A remote host refused to allow the network connection (typically
 *     because it is not running the requested service).
 *   EFAULT
 *     The receive buffer pointer(s) point outside the process's address
 *     space.
 *   EINTR
 *     The receive was interrupted by delivery of a signal before any data
 *     were available.
 *   EINVAL
 *     Invalid argument passed.
 *   ENOMEM
 *     Could not allocate memory.
 *   ENOTCONN
 *     The socket is associated with a connection-oriented protocol and has
 *     not been connected.
 *   ENOTSOCK
 *     The argument sockfd does not refer to a socket.
