 * Name: psock_sendto
 *
 * Description:
 *   If sendto() is used on a connection-mode (SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_SEQPACKET)
 *   socket, the parameters to and 'tolen' are ignored (and the error EISCONN
 *   may be returned when they are not NULL and 0), and the error ENOTCONN is
 *   returned when the socket was not actually connected.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   psock    A pointer to a NuttX-specific, internal socket structure
 *   buf      Data to send
 *   len      Length of data to send
 *   flags    Send flags
 *   to       Address of recipient
 *   tolen    The length of the address structure
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, returns the number of characters sent.  On a negated errno
 *   value is returned.  One of:
 *
 *   EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK
 *     The socket is marked non-blocking and the requested operation
 *     would block.
 *   EBADF
 *     An invalid descriptor was specified.
 *   ECONNRESET
 *     Connection reset by peer.
 *   EDESTADDRREQ
 *     The socket is not connection-mode, and no peer address is set.
 *   EFAULT
 *      An invalid user space address was specified for a parameter.
 *   EINTR
 *      A signal occurred before any data was transmitted.
 *   EINVAL
 *      Invalid argument passed.
 *   EISCONN
 *     The connection-mode socket was connected already but a recipient
 *     was specified. (Now either this error is returned, or the recipient
 *     specification is ignored.)
 *   EMSGSIZE
 *     The socket type requires that message be sent atomically, and the
 *     size of the message to be sent made this impossible.
 *   ENOBUFS
 *     The output queue for a network interface was full. This generally
 *     indicates that the interface has stopped sending, but may be
 *     caused by transient congestion.
 *   ENOMEM
 *     No memory available.
 *   ENOTCONN
 *     The socket is not connected, and no target has been given.
 *   ENOTSOCK
 *     The argument s is not a socket.
 *   EOPNOTSUPP
 *     Some bit in the flags argument is inappropriate for the socket
 *     type.
 *   EPIPE
 *     The local end has been shut down on a connection oriented socket.
 *     In this case the process will also receive a SIGPIPE unless
 *     MSG_NOSIGNAL is set.
