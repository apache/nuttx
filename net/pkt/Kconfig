config NET_PKT
	bool "Socket packet socket support"
	default n
	select NETDEV_IFINDEX
	---help---
		Enable or disable support for packet sockets.

		Packet sockets allow receiving and transmitting frames without
		a transport protocol in between. Frames received are copied into
		a packet socket tap before they enter the network. Data written into
		a packet socket will bypass the network altogether and be placed in
		the transmission buffer of the network interface driver.

		REVISIT: Currently only implemented for Ethernet.

if NET_PKT

config NET_PKT_PREALLOC_CONNS
	int "Preallocated packet sockets"
	default 1
	---help---
		Number of packet connections (all tasks).
		
		This number of connections will be pre-allocated during system boot.
		If dynamic connections allocation is enabled, more connections may
		be allocated at a later time, as the system needs them. Else this
		will be the maximum number of connections available to the system
		at all times.

		Set to 0 to disable (and rely only on dynamic allocations).

config NET_PKT_ALLOC_CONNS
	int "Dynamic packet connections allocation"
	default 0
	---help---
		Dynamic memory allocations for packet sockets.

		When set to 0 all dynamic allocations are disabled.

		When set to 1 a new connection will be allocated every time,
		and it will be free'd when no longer needed.

		Setting this to 2 or more will allocate the connections in
		batches (with batch size equal to this config). When a
		connection is no longer needed, it will be returned to the
		free connections pool, and it will never be deallocated!

config NET_PKT_MAX_CONNS
	int "Maximum number of packet connections"
	default 0
	depends on NET_PKT_ALLOC_CONNS > 0
	---help---
		If dynamic connections allocation is selected (NET_PKT_ALLOC_CONNS > 0)
		this will limit the number of connections that can be allocated.
		
		This is useful in case the system is under very heavy load (or
		under attack), ensuring that the heap will not be exhausted.
