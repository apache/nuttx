 * Name: pkt_in
 *
 * Description:
 *   Handle incoming packet input
 *
 *   This is the iob buffer version of pkt_input(),
 *   this function will support send/receive iob vectors directly between
 *   the driver and l3/l4 stack to avoid unnecessary memory copies,
 *   especially on hardware that supports Scatter/gather, which can
 *   greatly improve performance
 *   this function will uses d_iob as packets input which used by some
 *   NICs such as celluler net driver.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   dev - The device driver structure containing the received packet
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK     The packet has been processed  and can be deleted
 *  -EAGAIN There is a matching connection, but could not dispatch the packet
 *          yet.  Useful when a packet arrives before a recv call is in
 *          place.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   The network is locked.
