 * Name: pkt_input

 * Description:
 *   Handle incoming packet input
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   dev - The device driver structure containing the received packet
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK     The packet has been processed  and can be deleted
 *  -EAGAIN There is a matching connection, but could not dispatch the packet
 *          yet.  Useful when a packet arrives before a recv call is in
 *          place.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   The network is locked.
