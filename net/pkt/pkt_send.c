 * Name: psock_pkt_send
 *
 * Description:
 *   The psock_pkt_send() call may be used only when the packet socket is in
 *   a connected state (so that the intended recipient is known).
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   psock    An instance of the internal socket structure.
 *   buf      Data to send
 *   len      Length of data to send
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, returns the number of characters sent.  On  error,
 *   a negated errno value is retruend.  See send() for the complete list
 *   of return values.
