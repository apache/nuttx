 * Name: netdev_default
 *
 * Description:
 *   Return the default network device.  REVISIT:  At present this function
 *   arbitrarily returns the first UP device at the head of the device
 *   list.  Perhaps the default device should be a device name
 *   configuration option?
 *
 *   So why is this here:  It represents my current though for what to do
 *   if a socket is connected with INADDY_ANY.  In this case, I suppose we
 *   should use the IP address associated with some default device???
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   NULL
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *  Pointer to default network driver on success; null on failure
 *
