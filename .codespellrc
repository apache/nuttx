# Example for ignoring all current occurrences of (verifiably correct) word usage:
#   grep -hirw "emac" | sort | uniq >>.codespell-ignore-lines
exclude-file = .codespell-ignore-lines

# Ignore complete files (e.g. legal text or other immutable material).

# Ignore seemingly misspelled words.
#   lowercase: case insensitive
#   uppercase: case sensitive
# (see https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell/issues/3638)

# Exotic word occurrences should be filtered with the "exclude-file" setting instead.
