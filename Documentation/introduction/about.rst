==================
About Apache NuttX
==================

NuttX is a real time embedded operating system (RTOS). Its goals are:

* **Small Footprint**
  Usable in all but the tightest micro-controller environments, the focus is on the
  tiny-to-small, deeply embedded environment.

* **Rich Feature OS Set**
  The goal is to provide implementations of most standard POSIX OS interfaces to support a
  rich, multi-threaded development environment for deeply embedded processors.

  NON-GOALS: It is not a goal to provide the level of OS features like those provided by Linux. In order to work with
  smaller MCUs, small footprint must be more important than an extensive feature set. But standard compliance is more
  important than small footprint. Surely a smaller RTOS could be produced by ignoring standards. Think of NuttX is a
  tiny Linux work-alike with a much reduced feature set.

* **Highly Scalable**
  Fully scalable from tiny (8-bit) to moderate embedded (64-bit). Scalability with rich feature set
  is accomplished with: Many tiny source files, link from static libraries, highly configurable,
  use of weak symbols when available.

* **Standards Compliance**
  NuttX strives to achieve a high degree of standards compliance. The primary governing standards
  are POSIX and ANSI standards. Additional standard APIs from Unix and other common RTOS's are
  adopted for functionality not available under these standards or for functionality that is not
  appropriate for the deeply-embedded RTOS (such as ``fork()``).

  Because of this standards conformance, software developed under other standard OSs (such as
  Linux) should port easily to NuttX.

* **Real-Time**
  Fully pre-emptible; fixed priority, round-robin, and "sporadic" scheduling.

* **Totally Open**
  Non-restrictive Apache license.

* **GNU Toolchains**
  Compatible GNU toolchains based on `buildroot <http://buildroot.uclibc.org/>`__ available for `download <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/buildroot/downloads/>`__
  to provide a complete development environment for many architectures.

It is pretty compatible to typical BASIC interpreters of the 1980s, unlike some other UNIX BASIC interpreters, that implement a different syntax, breaking compatibility to existing programs. Bas offers many ANSI BASIC statements for structured programming, such as procedures, local variables and various loop types. Further there are matrix operations, automatic LIST indentation and many statements and functions found in specific classic dialects. Line numbers are not required."

Look at all those files and features... How can it be a tiny OS?
================================================================

The NuttX feature list (above) is fairly long and if you
look at the NuttX source tree, you will see that there are hundreds of source files comprising NuttX. How can NuttX be a tiny
OS with all of that?

  * **Lots of Features -- More can be smaller!**

    The philosophy behind that NuttX is that lots of features are great... *BUT* also that if you
    don't use those features, then you should not have to pay a penalty for the unused features.
    And, with NuttX, you don't! If you don't use a feature, it will not be included in the final
    executable binary. You only have to pay the penalty of increased footprint for the features that
    you actually use.

    Using a variety of technologies, NuttX can scale from the very tiny to the moderate-size system.
    I have executed NuttX with some simple applications in as little as 32K *total* memory (code and
    data). On the other hand, typical, richly featured NuttX builds require more like 64K (and
    if all of the features are used, this can push 100K).

  * **Many, many files -- More really is smaller!**

   One may be intimidated by the size NuttX source tree. There are hundreds of source files! How can
   that be a tiny OS? Actually, the large number of files is one of the tricks to keep NuttX small
   and as scalable as possible. Most files contain only a single function. Sometimes just one tiny
   function with only a few lines of code. Why?

     - **Static Libraries**.
       Because in the NuttX build processed, objects are compiled and saved into *static libraries*
       (*archives*). Then, when the file executable is linked, only the object files that are
       needed are extracted from the archive and added to the final executable. By having many,
       many tiny source files, you can assure that no code that you do not execute is ever
       included in the link. And by having many, tiny source files you have better granularity --
       if you don't use that tiny function of even just a few lines of code, it will not be
       included in the binary.

* **Other Tricks**

  As mentioned above, the use of many, tiny source files and linking from static libraries
  keeps the size of NuttX down. Other tricks used in NuttX include:

  - **Configuration Files**.

    Before you build NuttX, you must provide a configuration file that specifies what features you plan to use and
    which features you do not. This configuration file contains a long list of settings that control what is
    built into NuttX and what is not. There are hundreds of such settings (see the
    `Configuration Variable Documentation <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NUTTX/Configuration+Variables?src=contextnavpagetreemode>`__
    for a partial list that excludes platform specific settings). These many, many configuration options allow
    NuttX to be highly tuned to meet size requirements. The downside to all of these configuration options is that
    it greatly complicates the maintenance of NuttX -- but that is my problem, not yours. -

  - **Weak Symbols**
    The GNU toolchain supports *weak* symbols and these also help to keep the size of NuttX down.
    Weak symbols prevent object files from being drawn into the link even if they are accessed from source code.
    Careful use of weak symbols is another trick for keep unused code out of the final binary.
