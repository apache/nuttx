Enabling Shell Logins
*********************

NuttShell sessions can be protected by requiring that the user supply
username and password credentials at the beginning of the session.
Logins can be enabled for standard USB or serial consoles with::

  CONFIG_NSH_CONSOLE_LOGIN=y

Logins for Telnet sessions can be enabled separately with::

  CONFIG_NSH_TELNET_LOGIN=y

Logins can be enabled for either or both session types. On a successful
login, the user will have access to the NSH session::

  login: admin
  password:
  User Logged-in!

  NuttShell (NSH)
  nsh>

After each failed login attempt, a delay can be set up. The purpose of
this delay is to discourage attempts to crack the password by brute
force. That delay is configured with::

  CONFIG_NSH_LOGIN_FAILDELAY=0

This setting provides the login failure delay in units of milliseconds.
The system will pause this amount of time after each failed login
attempt. After a certain number of failed login attempts, the session
will be closed. That number is controlled by::

  CONFIG_NSH_LOGIN_FAILCOUNT=3

Verification of Credentials
***************************

There are three ways that NSH can be configured to verify user
credentials at login time:

  #. The simplest implementation simply uses fixed login credentials and
     is selected with::

      CONFIG_NSH_LOGIN_FIXED=y

     The fixed login credentials are selected via::

      CONFIG_NSH_LOGIN_USERNAME=admin
      CONFIG_NSH_LOGIN_PASSWORD="Administrator"

     This is not very flexible since there can be only one user and the
     password is fixed in the FLASH image. This option is also not very
     secure because a malicious user could get the password by just
     looking at the ``.text`` stings in the flash image.

  #. NSH can also be configured to defer the entire user credential
     verification to platform-specific logic with this setting::

      CONFIG_NSH_LOGIN_PLATFORM=y

     In this case, NSH will call a platform-specific function to perform
     the verification of user credentials. The platform-specific logic
     must provide a function with the following prototype:

     .. code-block:: c

       int platform_user_verify(FAR const char *username, FAR const char *password);

     which is prototyped an described in ``apps/include/nsh.h`` and which
     may be included like:

     .. code-block:: c

      #include <apps/nsh.h>

     An appropriate place to implement this function might be in the
     directory ``apps/platform/<board>``.

  #. A final option is to use a password file contained encrypted password
     information. This final option is selected with the following and
     described in more detail in the following paragraph::

       CONFIG_NSH_LOGIN_PASSWD=y

Password Files
**************

NuttX can also be configured to support a password file, by default at
``/etc/passwd``. This option enables support for a password file::

  CONFIG_NSH_LOGIN_PASSWD=y

This options requires that you have selected ``CONFIG_FSUTILS_PASSWD=y``
to enable the access methods of ``apps/fsutils/passwd``::

  CONFIG_FSUTILS_PASSWD=y

And this determines the location of the password file in a mounted
volume::

  CONFIG_FSUTILS_PASSWD_PATH="/etc/passwd"

``/etc/passwd`` is a *standard* location, but you will need to locate
the password where ever you have a mounted volume.

The password file can be a fixed list of users in a ROMFS file system or
a modifiable list maintained in a file in some writable file system. If
the password file lies in a read-only file system like ROMFS, then you
should also indicate that the password file is read-only.

  CONFIG_FSUTILS_PASSWD_READONLY=y

If the password file is writable, then additional NSH commands will be
enabled to modify the password file: ```useradd`` <#cmduseradd>`__,
```userdel`` <#cmduserdel>`__, and ```passwd`` <#cmdpasswd>`__. If you
do not wish you have these commands available, then they should be
specifically disabled.

The password file logic requires a few additional settings:

  #. The size of dynamically allocated and freed buffer that is used for
     file access::

       CONFIG_FSUTILS_PASSWD_IOBUFFER_SIZE=512

  #. And the 128-bit encryption key. The password file currently uses the
     Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA), but could be extended to use
     something more powerful.

        CONFIG_FSUTILS_PASSWD_KEY1=0x12345678
        CONFIG_FSUTILS_PASSWD_KEY2=0x9abcdef0
        CONFIG_FSUTILS_PASSWD_KEY3=0x12345678
        CONFIG_FSUTILS_PASSWD_KEY4=0x9abcdef0

Password can only be decrypted with access to this key. Note that this
key could potentially be fished out of your FLASH image, but without any
symbolic information, that would be a difficult job since the TEA KEY is
binary data and not distinguishable from other binary data in the FLASH
image.

If the password file is enabled (``CONFIG_NSH_LOGIN_PASSWD=y``), then
the fixed user credentials will not be used for the NSH session login.
Instead, the password file will be consulted to verify the user
credentials.

Creating a Password File for a ROMFS File System
************************************************

What we want to accomplish is a ROMFS file system, mounted at ``/etc``
and containing the password file, ``passwd`` like::

  NuttShell (NSH)
  nsh> ls -Rl /etc
  /etc:
   dr-xr-xr-x       0 .
   dr-xr-xr-x       0 init.d/
   -r--r--r--      39 passwd
  /etc/init.d:
   dr-xr-xr-x       0 ..
   -r--r--r--     110 rcS
  nsh>

Where ``/etc/init.d/rcS`` is the start-up script; ``/etc/passwd`` is a
the password file. Note that here we assume that you are already using a
start-up script. We can then piggyback the passwd file into the ``/etc``
file system already mounted for the NSH start up file as described above
`above <#custinit>`__.

I use the sim/nsh configuration to create a new password file, but other
configurations could also be used. That configuration already supports a
ROMFS file system, passwords, and login prompts. First, I make these
changes to that configuration.

  #. Disable logins:

    .. code-block:: diff

      - CONFIG_NSH_CONSOLE_LOGIN=y
      + # CONFIG_NSH_CONSOLE_LOGIN is not set
        # CONFIG_NSH_TELNET_LOGIN is not set

  #. Move the password file to a write-able file system:

    .. code-block:: diff

      - CONFIG_FSUTILS_PASSWD_PATH="/etc/passwd"
      + CONFIG_FSUTILS_PASSWD_PATH="/tmp/passwd"

  #. Make the password file modifiable

    .. code-block:: diff

      - CONFIG_FSUTILS_PASSWD_READONLY=y
      # CONFIG_FSUTILS_PASSWD_READONLY is not set

Now rebuild the simulation. No login should be required to enter the
shell and you should find the ```useradd`` <#cmduseradd>`__,
```userdel`` <#cmduserdel>`__, and ```passwd`` <#cmdpasswd>`__ commands
available in the help summary, provided that they are enabled. Make
certain that the ``useradd`` command is not disabled::

  # CONFIG_NSH_DISABLE_USERADD is not set

Use the NSH ```useradd`` <#cmduseradd>`__ command to add new uses with
new user passwords like::

  nsh> useradd <username> <password>

Do this as many times as you would like. Each time that you do this a
new entry with an encrypted password will be added to the ``passwd``
file at ``/tmp/passwd``. You can see the content of the password file
like::

  nsh> cat /tmp/passwd

When you are finished, you can simply copy the ``/tmp/passwd`` content
from the ``cat`` command and paste it into an editor. Make sure to
remove any carriage returns that may have ended up on the file if you
are using Windows.

Then create/re-create the ``nsh_romfsimg.h`` file as described below.

  #. The content on the ``nsh_romfsimg.h`` header file is generated from a
     template directory structure. Create the directory structure::

      mkdir etc
      mkdir etc/init.d

     And copy your existing startup script into ``etc/init.c`` as ``rcS``.

  #. Save your new password file in the ``etc/`` directory as ``passwd``.

  #. Create the new ROMFS image::

      genromfs -f romfs_img -d etc -V MyVolName

  #. Convert the ROMFS image to a C header file::

      xxd -i romfs_img >nsh_romfsimg.h

  #. Edit ``nsh_romfsimg.h``: Mark both data definitions as ``const`` so
     that the data will be stored in FLASH.

  #. Edit nsh_romfsimg.h, mark both data definitions as ``const`` so that
     that will be stored in FLASH.

There is a good example of how to do this in the NSH simulation
configuration at
`boards/sim/sim/sim/configs/nsh <https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/blob/master/boards/sim/sim/sim/configs/nsh/>`__.
The ROMFS support files are provided at
`boards/sim/include <https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/blob/master/boards/sim/sim/sim/include/>`__
and the
`README.txt <https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/blob/master/boards/sim/sim/sim/README.txt>`__
file at the location provides detailed information about creating and
modifying the ROMFS file system.
