EEPROM
======

EEPROMs are a form of Memory
  Technology Device (MTD).  EEPROMs are non-volatile memory like FLASH, but
  differ in underlying memory technology and differ in usage in many respects:
  They may not be organized into blocks (at least from the standpoint of the
  user) and it is not necessary to erase the EEPROM memory before re-writing
  it.  In addition, EEPROMs tend to be much smaller than FLASH parts, usually
  only a few kilobytes vs megabytes for FLASH.  EEPROM tends to be used to
  retain a small amount of device configuration information; FLASH tends
  to be used for program or massive data storage. For these reasons, it may
  not be convenient to use the more complex MTD interface but instead use
  the simple character interface provided by the EEPROM drivers.

drivers/mtd/at24xx.c
--------------------

This is a driver for I2C-based at24cxx EEPROM (at24c32, at24c64, at24c128,
at24c256, at24c512).  This driver is currently provided as an MTD driver
but could easily be modified to support the character driver interface.

File Systems
============

Most EEPROM parts are too small to be candidates for use with a file
system.  The character driver interface is optimal for these small parts
because you can open and access the EEPROM part as if it were a single,
fixed size file.

It is also possible to use these character drivers with a file system.
The character driver can converted to a block device using the NuttX loop
device.  The loop device can be found the file drivers/loop.c.  Interface
function prototypes can be found in include/nuttx/fs/fs.h::

    int losetup(FAR const char *devname, FAR const char *filename,
                uint16_t sectsize, off_t offset, bool readonly);

Given a file or character devices at 'filename', losetup will create the
block device 'devname' using a bogus sector size of sectsize.  'offset' is
normally zero but can be used to provide an offset into the EEPROM where
the block driver data starts;  The EEPROM block driver can also be read-
only.

There is a corresponding function that will destroy the loop device::

    int loteardown(FAR const char *devname);
