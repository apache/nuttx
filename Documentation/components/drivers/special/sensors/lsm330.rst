LSM330_SPI
==========

Contributed by Bob Feretich

The LSM330 consists of a multi-range tri-axis accelerometer and a
multi-range tri-axis gyroscope. The tri-axis accelerometer features two
state machines that can be firmware programmed for event detection. The
tri-axis gyroscope features threshold and duration registers for event
detection.

This driver supports the LSM330 in SPI mode. In this mode, the LSM330
that can transfer data at 10 MHz. The data transfer performance of
this part permits the sensor to be sampled "on demand" rather than
periodically sampled by a worker task. See the description of the "Common
Sensor Register Interface" below for more details. It also implements the
"Sensor Cluster Driver Interface".
