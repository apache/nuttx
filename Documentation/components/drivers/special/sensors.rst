Currently in NuttX we have 3 different approaches to sensor interfaces:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    sensors/sensors_uorb.rst
    sensors/sensors_legacy.rst
    sensors/sensors_cluster.rst

The preferred way for implementing new sensors is
the :ref:`New sensor framework <new_sensor_framework>`, which provides the most
general interafce.
