GD25 NOR Flash
==============

NuttX provides support for SPI based NOR flashes from GD25
family. The supported capacity is up to 256 Mbit (32 MB).

The driver is enabled by option ``CONFIG_MTD_GD25``. It is possible
to select the SPI mode with ``CONFIG_GD25_SPIMODE`` option and
communication frequency with ``CONFIG_GD25_SPIFREQUENCY`` option. Another
important configuration is the setting of SPI delays. Unlike QSPI in memory
mode, where all delays are set to 0, SPI peripherals may have different
default delays. Delays for GD25 flash can be set by ``CONFIG_GD25_START_DELAY``,
``CONFIG_GD25_STOP_DELAY``, ``CONFIG_GD25_CS_DELAY`` and ``CONFIG_GD25_IFDELAY``
options. Default values are set to 5 us.

The size of the flash is set automatically during the device initialization.

The flash memory has to be initialized before used. This is typically done
from board support package layer during the board's bringup phase. This
operation is performed by following function.

.. code-block:: C

   #include <nuttx/mtd/mtd.h>

   FAR struct mtd_dev_s *gd25_initialize(FAR struct spi_dev_s *spi,
                                         uint32_t spi_devid)
