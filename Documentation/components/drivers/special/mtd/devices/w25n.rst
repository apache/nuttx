W25N NAND Flash
===============

NuttX provides support for NAND flashes from W25N family.
The only supported variant is currently 1 Gbit (128 MB) large flash.

The implementation doesn't support following functionalities at the moment.

- No bad block management (BBM). Factory bad blocks and runtime bad
  blocks are not tracked.
- No bad block table (BBT) scanning at initialization.
- No Quad SPI support (standard SPI only).
- No access to spare area (64 bytes/page) or OTP region.

The flash is enabled by option ``CONFIG_MTD_W25N``. It is possible
to select the SPI mode with ``CONFIG_W25N_SPIMODE`` option and
communication frequency with ``CONFIG_W25N_SPIFREQUENCY`` option.

The flash memory has to be initialized before used. This is typically done
from board support package layer during the board's bringup phase. This
operation is performed by following function.

.. code-block:: C

   #include <nuttx/mtd/mtd.h>

   FAR struct mtd_dev_s *w25n_initialize(FAR struct spi_dev_s *spi,
                                         uint32_t spi_devid)
