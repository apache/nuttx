AT25 EEPROM
===========

NuttX provides support for SPI based EEPROM AT25. The supported
capacity is 4 MB.

The driver is enabled by option ``CONFIG_MTD_AT25``. It is possible
to select the SPI mode with ``CONFIG_AT25_SPIMODE`` option and
communication frequency with ``CONFIG_AT25_SPIFREQUENCY`` option.

The memory has to be initialized before used. This is typically done
from board support package layer during the board's bringup phase. This
operation is performed by following function.

.. code-block:: C

   #include <nuttx/mtd/mtd.h>

   FAR struct mtd_dev_s *at25_initialize(FAR struct spi_dev_s *dev)
