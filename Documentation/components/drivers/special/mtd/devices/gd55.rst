GD55 NOR Flash
==============

NuttX provides support for QSPI based NOR flashes from GigaDevices GD55 family.
The supported capacity is up to 2 Gbit (256 MB).

The driver is enabled by option ``CONFIG_MTD_GD55``. It is possible
to select the QSPI mode with ``CONFIG_GD55_QSPIMODE`` option and
communication frequency with ``CONFIG_GD55_QSPI_FREQUENCY`` option.

The flash allows to simulate 512-byte large erase blocks if option
``CONFIG_GD55_SECTOR512`` is enabled. This is used to map the native
256 byte sectors to 512 byte sectors. It is useful if using a file
system that demands 512 byte sectors, such as FAT.

The size of the flash is set automatically during the device initialization.

The flash memory has to be initialized before used. This is typically done
from board support package layer during the board's bringup phase. This
operation is performed by following function.

.. code-block:: C

   #include <nuttx/mtd/mtd.h>

   FAR struct mtd_dev_s *gd55_initialize(FAR struct qspi_dev_s *qspi,
                                         bool unprotect)
