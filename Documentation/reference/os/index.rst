Architecture APIs
=================

The file ``include/nuttx/arch.h`` identifies by prototype all of
the APIs that must be provided by the architecture specific logic.
The internal OS APIs that architecture-specific logic must
interface with are also identified in ``include/nuttx/arch.h`` or
in other header files.
