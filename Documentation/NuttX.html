  <td>
    <p>
      The goal is to provide implementations of most standard POSIX OS interfaces
      to support a rich, multi-threaded development environment for deeply embedded
      processors.
    </p>
      NON-GOALS: It is not a goal to provide the level of OS features like those provided by Linux.
      In order to work with smaller MCUs, small footprint must be more important than an extensive feature set.
      But standard compliance is more important than small footprint.
      Surely a smaller RTOS could be produced by ignoring standards.
      Think of NuttX is a tiny Linux work-alike with a much reduced feature set.

      Fully scalable from tiny (8-bit) to moderate embedded (32-bit).

      Many tiny source files, link from static libraries, highly configurable, use of
      weak symbols when available.

    <p>
      NuttX strives to achieve a high degree of standards compliance.
      The primary governing standards are POSIX and ANSI standards.
      Additional standard APIs from Unix and other common RTOS's are
      adopted for functionality not available under these standards
      or for functionality that is not appropriate for the deeply-embedded
      RTOS (such as <code>fork()</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this standards conformance, software developed under other
      standard OSs (such as Linux) should port easily to NuttX.

  <b>Look at all those files and features... How can it be a tiny OS?</b>.
  The NuttX feature list (above) is fairly long and if you look at the NuttX

  NuttX.  How can NuttX be a tiny OS with all of that?

    <p>
      The philosophy behind that NuttX is that lots of features are great... <i>BUT</i>
      also that if you don't use those features, then you should not have to pay a penalty
      for the unused features.
      And, with NuttX, you don't!  If you don't use a feature, it will not
      be included in the final executable binary.
      You only have to pay the penalty of increased footprint for the features
      that you actually use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using a variety of technologies, NuttX can scale from the very tiny to
      the moderate-size system.  I have executed NuttX with some simple applications
      in as little as 32K <i>total</i> memory (code and data).
      On the other hand, typical, richly featured NuttX builds require more like 64K
      (and if all of the features are used, this can push 100K).

    <p>
      One may be intimidated by the size NuttX source tree.  There are hundreds of source files!
      How can that be a tiny OS?
      Actually, the large number of files is one of the tricks to keep NuttX small and
      as scalable as possible.
      Most files contain only a single function.
      Sometimes just one tiny function with only a few lines of code.
      Why?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Static Libraries</b>.
        Because in the NuttX build processed, objects are compiled and saved into
        <i>static libraries</i> (<i>archives</i>).
        Then, when the file executable is linked, only the object files that are needed
        are extracted from the archive and added to the final executable.
        By having many, many tiny source files, you can assure that no code that you do
        not execute is ever included in the link.
        And by having many, tiny source files you have better granularity --
        if you don't use that tiny function of even just a few lines of code, it will
        not be included in the binary.

    <p>
      As mentioned above, the use of many, tiny source files and linking from static
      libraries keeps the size of NuttX down.
      Other tricks used in NuttX include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
         <b>Configuration Files</b>.
         Before you build NuttX, you must provide a configuration file that specifies
         what features you plan to use and which features you do not.
         This configuration file contains a long list of settings that control
         what is built into NuttX and what is not.
         There are hundreds of such settings
         (see the <a href="NuttXConfigVariables.html">Configuration Variable Documentation</a>
         for a partial list that excludes platform specific settings).
         These many, many configuration options allow NuttX to be highly tuned to
         meet size requirements.
         The downside to all of these configuration options is that it greatly
         complicates the maintenance of NuttX -- but that is my problem, not yours.
      </li>
      <li>
         <b>Weak Symbols</b>
         The GNU toolchain supports <i>weak</i> symbols and these also help to keep
         the size of NuttX down.
         Weak symbols prevent object files from being drawn into the link even if they
         are accessed from source code.
         Careful use of weak symbols is another trick for keep unused code out of the
         final binary.

        <ul>
          <p>
            <b>STATUS:</b>
            The basic EA3131 port is complete and verified in NuttX-5.2.
            This basic port includes basic boot-up, serial console, and timer interrupts.
            This port was extended in NuttX 5.3 with a USB high speed driver contributed by David Hewson.
            David also contributed I2C and SPI drivers plus several important LPC313x USB bug fixes that appear in the NuttX 5.6 release.
            This port has been verified using the NuttX OS test, USB serial and mass storage tests and includes a working implementation of the NuttShell (<a href="NuttShell.html">NSH</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            Support for <a href="NuttXDemandPaging.html">on-demand paging</a> has been developed for the EA3131.
            That support would all execute of a program in SPI FLASH by paging code sections out of SPI flash as needed.

            The basic H3131 port is complete and verified in NuttX-6.3.
            It is similar to the EA3131 port except:  (1) I have not yet gotten the SDRAM to work, and (2) this board was used to develop and verify the USB 2.0, low-/full-/high-speed EHCI host controller driver.
            NOTE: That driver should work on the EA3131 as well.  However, the EA3131 uses a PCA9532 PWM part to controller the port power so the it would not quite be a simple drop-in.

          <b>Atmel SAMA5D3 Xplained development board</b>
          This is the  port of NuttX to the Atmel SAMA5D3 Xplained development board.
          The board features the Atmel SAMA5D36 microprocessor.
          See the <a href="http://www.atmel.com/devices/sama5d36.aspx">Atmel Website</a> for additional information about this board.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>STATUS</b>.
          This port is complete as of this writing and ready for general use.
          The basic port is expected to be simple because of the similarity to the SAMAD3<i>x</i>-EK boards and is available in the NuttX 7.2 release.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the drivers and capabilities of the SAMA5D3x-EK boards can be used with the SAMA5D3 Xplained board.
          The primary difference between the ports is that the SAMA5D3x-EK supports NOR FLASH and NuttX can be configured to boot directly from NOR FLASH.
          The SAMA5D3 Xplained board does not have NOR FLASH and, as a consequence NuttX must boot into SDRAM with the help of U-Boot.

        This is the  port of NuttX to the Atmel SAMA5D4-MB Rev C. development board (which should be compatible with the SAMA5D4-EK).
        These boards feature the Atmel SAMA5D44 microprocessors with compatibility with most of the SAMA5D3 peripherals.
      </p>
      <p><b>STATUS</b>.
        At the time of the release of NuttX-7.3, the basic port for the SAMA5D4-MB was complete.
        The board had basic functionality.
        But full functionality was not available until NuttX-7.4.
        In NuttX-7.4 support was added for the L2 cache, many security features, XDMAC, HSMCI and Ethernet integrated with XDMAC, the LCDC, TWI, SSC, and most of the existing SAMA5 drivers.
        Timers were added to support <i>Tickless</i> operation.
        The TM7000 LCDC with the maXTouch multi-touch controller are also fully support in a special NxWM configuration for that larger display.
        Support for a graphics media player is included (although there were issues with the WM8904 audio CODEC on my board).
        An SRAM bootloader was also included.

        <b>STATUS</b>.
        Initial support for the NUC120 was released in NuttX-6.26.
        This initial support is very minimal:
        There is a NuttShell (<a href="NuttShell.html">NSH</a>) configuration that might be the basis for an application development.
        As of this writing, more device drivers are needed to make this a more complete port.
        Refer to the NuttX board <a href="https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/arm/nuc1xx/nutiny-nuc120/README.txt" target="_blank">README</a> file for further information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Memory Usage</b>.
        For a full-featured RTOS such as NuttX, providing support in a usable and meaningful way within the tiny memories of the NUC120 demonstrates the scalability of NuttX.  The NUC120LE2AN comes in a 48-pin package and has 128KB FLASH and 16KB of SRAM.
        When running the NSH configuration (itself a full up application), there is still more than 90KB of FLASH and 10KB or SRAM available for further application development).
      </p>
      <p>
        Static memory usage can be shown with <code>size</code> command:
      </p>
      <ul><pre>
$ size nuttx
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  35037     106    1092   36235    8d8b nuttx
</pre></ul>
      <p>
        NuttX, the NSH application, and GCC libraries use 34.2KB of FLASH leaving 93.8KB of FLASH (72%) free from additional application development.
        Static SRAM usage is about 1.2KB (&lt;4%) and leaves 14.8KB (86%) available for heap at runtime.
        SRAM usage at run-time can be shown with the NSH <code>free</code> command:
      </p>
      <ul><pre>
NuttShell (NSH) NuttX-6.26
nsh> free
             total       used       free    largest
Mem:         14160       3944      10216       10216
nsh>
</pre></ul>
    <p>
      You can see that 10.0KB (62%) is available for further application development.

      Two boards are supported:
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>STM32L-Discovery</b>.
          This is a port of NuttX to the STMicro STM32L-Discovery development board.
          The STM32L-Discovery board is based on the STM32L152RBT6 MCU (128KB FLASH and 16KB of SRAM).
        </p>
        <p>
          The STM32L-Discovery and STM32L152C DISCOVERY kits are functionally equivalent.
          The difference is the internal Flash memory size (STM32L152RBT6 with 128 Kbytes or STM32L152RCT6 with 256 Kbytes).
          Both boards feature:
        </p>

        Board support for the Nucleo-L152RE was contributed by Mateusz Szafoni in NuttX-7.28.
        Available configurations include NSH, ADC, and PWM.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>STATUS</b>.
      Initial support for the STM32L-Discovery was released in NuttX-6.28.
      Addition (architecture-only) support for the STM32L152xC family was added in NuttX-7.21.
      Support for the Nucleo-L152RE was added in NuttX-7.28.
    </p>
    <p>
      That initial STM32L-Discovery support included a configuration using the NuttShell (<a href="NuttShell.html">NSH</a>) that might be the basis for an application development.
      A driver for the on-board segment LCD is included as well as an option to drive the segment LCD from an NSH &quot;built-in&quot; command.
      Refer to the STM32L-Discovery board <a href="https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/arm/stm32/stm32ldiscovery/README.txt" target="_blank">README</a> file for further information.

    <p>
      <b>Memory Usage</b>.
      <blockquote><small>
      REVISIT:  These numbers are out of date.  Current NuttX sizing might be somewhat larger.
      </small></blockquote>
      For a full-featured RTOS such as NuttX, providing support in a usable and meaningful way within the tiny memories of the STM32L152RBT6 demonstrates the scalability of NuttX.  The STM32L152RBT6 comes in a 64-pin package and has 128KB FLASH and 16KB of SRAM.
    </p>
    <p>
      Static memory usage can be shown with <code>size</code> command:
    </p>
    <ul><pre>
$ size nuttx
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  39664     132    1124   40920    9fd8 nuttx
</pre></ul>
    <p>
      NuttX, the NSH application, and GCC libraries use 38.7KB of FLASH leaving 89.3B of FLASH (70%) free from additional application development.
      Static SRAM usage is about 1.2KB (&lt;4%) and leaves 14.8KB (86%) available for heap at runtime.
    </p>
      SRAM usage at run-time can be shown with the NSH <code>free</code> command:
    <ul><pre>
NuttShell (NSH) NuttX-6.27
nsh> free
             total       used       free    largest
Mem:         14096       3928      10168      10168
nsh>
</pre></ul>
    <p>
      You can see that 9.9KB (62%) of SRAM heap is still available for further application development while NSH is running.

        The basic SAM3U-EK port was released in NuttX version 5.1. The basic port includes boot-up
        logic, interrupt driven serial console, and system timer interrupts.
        That release passes the NuttX OS test and is proven to have a valid OS implementation.
        A configuration to support the NuttShell is also included.
        NuttX version 5.4 adds support for the HX8347 LCD on the SAM3U-EK board.
        This LCD support includes an example using the

        That initial, 5.6, basic release included <i>timer</i> interrupts and a <i>serial console</i> and was
        verified using the NuttX OS test (<code>apps/examples/ostest</code>).
        Configurations available include include a verified NuttShell (NSH) configuration

        The NSH configuration supports the Nucleus2G's microSD slot and additional configurations
        are available to exercise the USB serial and USB mass storage devices.
        However, due to some technical reasons, neither the SPI nor the USB device drivers are fully verified.
        (Although they have since been verified on other platforms; this needs to be revisited on the Nucleus2G).
      </p>
      <p><b>Obsoleted</b>.

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The LC823450XGEVK is an audio processing system Evaluation Board Kit used to demonstrate the LC823450.  This part can record and playback, and offers High-Resolution 32-bit & 192 kHz audio processing capability.  It is possible to cover most of the functions necessary for a portable audio with only this LSI as follows.  It has Dual CPU and DSP with High processing capability, and internal 1656K-Byte SRAM, which make it possible to implement large scale program.  And it has integrated analog functions (low-power Class D HP amplifier, PLL, ADC etc.) so that PCB space and cost is reduced, and it has various interface (USB, SD, SPI, UART, etc.) to make extensibility high.  Also it is provided with various function including SBC/AAC codec by DSP and UART and ASRC (Asynchronous Sample Rate Converter) for Bluetooth® audio. It is very small chip size in spite of the multi-funciton as described above and it realizes the low power consumption. Therefore, it is applicable to portable audio markets such as Wireless headsets and will show high performance.

      <b>OmnibusF4</b>.
      Initial support for the OmnibusF4 family of flight management units was contributed by Bill Gatliff in NuttX-7.29.
      &quot;OmnibusF4&quot; is not a product name <i>per se</i>, but rather a design specification that many product vendors adhere to.
      The specification defines the major components, and how those components are wired into the microcontroller.
      <i>Airbot</i> is one such vendor.  They publish a <a href="http://bit.ly/obf4pro">schematic</a>.
      Other software that supports the OmnibusF4 family include Betaflight, iNAV, and many others.
      PX4 recently added support as well, also based on NuttX.
      No code from those resources is included in this port.
      The OmnibusF4 specifcation mandates the InvenSense MPU6000 which is included in NuttX-7.29 along with a driver for the MAX7546 OSD.

      <b>Driver Status</b>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b>NuttX-6.20</b>
          Several drivers have been copied from the related LPC17xx port but require integration into the LPC43xx:  ADC, DAC, GPDMA, I2C, SPI, and SSP.
          The registers for these blocks are the same in both the LPC43xx and the LPC17xx and they should integrate into the LPC43xx very easily by simply adapting the clocking and pin configuration logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other LPC17xx drivers were not brought into the LPC43xx port because these peripherals have been completely redesigned:  CAN, Ethernet, USB device, and USB host.
        </p>
        <p>
          So then there is no support for the following LPC43xx peripherals: SD/MMC, EMC, USB0,USB1, Ethernet, LCD, SCT, Timers 0-3, MCPWM, QEI, Alarm timer, WWDT, RTC, Event monitor, and CAN.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these can be leveraged from other MCUs that appear to support the same peripheral IP:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The LPC43xx USB0 peripheral appears to be the same as the USB OTG peripheral for the LPC31xx.
            The LPC31xx USB0 device-side driver has been copied from the LPC31xx port but also integration into the LPC43xx (clocking and pin configuration).
            It should be possible to complete porting of this LPC31xx driver with a small porting effort.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Ethernet block looks to be based on the same IP as the STM32 Ethernet and, as a result, it should be possible to leverage the NuttX STM32 Ethernet driver with a little more effort.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>NuttX-6.21</b>
        Added support for a SPIFI block driver and for RS-485 option to the serial driver.

      <li>

          <li>
            A mature port to the DK-TM4C129X was implemented and was released in NuttX 7.7.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the initial release, verified drivers were available for Ethernet interface, I2C, and timers as well as board LEDs and push buttons.
            Other Tiva/Stellaris drivers should port to the TM4C129X without major difficulty.
          </li>
          <li>
            This board supports included two configurations for the NuttShell (<a href="http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttShell.html">NSH</a>).
            Both are networked enabled:  One configured to support IPv4 and one configured to supported IPv6.
            Instructions are included in the board <a href="https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/src/master/boards/arm/tiva/dk-tm4c129x/README.txt" target="_blank">README</a> file for configuring both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tiva PWM and Quadrature Encoder drivers were contributed to NuttX in 7.18 by Young.

      Basic, unverified architectural support for the CC13x2 was added in NuttX-7.28.
      Fragmentary support for very similar CC26x2 family is included.
      This is a work in progress and, with any luck, a fully verified port will be available in NuttX-7.29.
      It is currently code complete (minus some ROM <i>DriverLib</i> hooks) but untested.

      Basic board support for the TI LaunchXL-CC1312R1 board is in place.

        <b>STATUS:</b>
        The basic port is nearly code complete but unverified in NuttX-7.28;  The NSH configuration was fully functional in NuttX-7.29.
        This effort is stalled on further radio development.
        The plan was to integrate the IEEE 802.15.4 radio provided by the co-resident Cortex-M0.  The Cortex-M0 interface, however, is not available with an open license that would permit redistribution.

        <b>STATUS:</b>
        As of this writing, the basic port is code complete and a fully verified configuration exists for the NuttShell <a href="http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttShell.html">NSH</a>).
        The first fully functional SAM4L Xplained Pro port was released in NuttX-6.28.
        Support for the SAM4L Xplained modules was added in NuttX-6.29:
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Memory Usage</b>.
        The ATSAM4LC4C comes in a 100-pin package and has 256KB FLASH and 32KB of SRAM.
        Below is the current memory usage for the NSH configuration (June 9, 2013).
        This is <i>not</i> a minimal implementation, but a full-featured NSH configuration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Static memory usage can be shown with <code>size</code> command:
      </p>
      <ul><pre>
$ size nuttx
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  43572     122    2380   46074    b3fa nuttx
</pre></ul>
      <p>
        NuttX, the NSH application, and GCC libraries use 42.6KB of FLASH leaving 213.4B of FLASH (83.4%) free from additional application development.
        Static SRAM usage is about 2.3KB (&lt;7%) and leaves 29.7KB (92.7%) available for heap at runtime.
      </p>
        SRAM usage at run-time can be shown with the NSH <code>free</code> command.
        This runtime memory usage includes the static memory usage <i>plus</i> all dynamic memory allocation for things like stacks and I/O buffers:
      <ul><pre>
NuttShell (NSH) NuttX-6.28
nsh> free
             total       used       free    largest
Mem:         29232       5920      23312      23312
</pre></ul>
    <p>
      You can see that 22.8KB (71.1%) of the SRAM heap is still available for further application development while NSH is running.

    <p><b>AVR-Specific Issues</b>.
      The basic AVR port is solid.
      The biggest issue for using AVR is its tiny SRAM memory and its Harvard architecture.
      Because of the Harvard architecture, constant data that resides to flash is inaccessible using &quot;normal&quot; memory reads and writes (only SRAM data can be accessed &quot;normally&quot;).
      Special AVR instructions are available for accessing data in FLASH, but these have not been integrated into the normal, general purpose OS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most NuttX test applications are console-oriented with lots of strings used for <code>printf()</code> and debug output.
      These strings are all stored in SRAM now due to these data accessing issues and even the smallest console-oriented applications can quickly fill a 4-8K memory.
      So, in order for the AVR port to be useful, one of two things would need to be done:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Don't use console applications that required lots of strings.
        The basic AVR port is solid and your typical deeply embedded application should work fine.
        Or,
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a special version of printf that knows how to access strings that reside in FLASH (or EEPROM).

          Current Status: I think I have a hardware problem with my serial port setup.
          There is a good chance that the NSH port is complete and functional, but I am not yet able to demonstrate that.
          At present, I get nothing coming in the serial RXD line (probably because the pins are configured wrong or I have the MAX232 connected wrong).

        problem, some pipeline issue that is not handled properly by the gcc 3.4.5 toolchain
        (which has very limit SH-1 support to begin with), or perhaps with the CMON debugger.

      Basic support for the RISC-V architecture was contributed by Ken Pettit in NuttX-7.19.
      This support is for a custom NEXT RISC-V NR5Mxx (RV32IM).
      The initial release is <i>thin</i> but a great starting point for anyone interested in RISC-V development with NuttX.

    <p>
      This is a tougher environment.
      In this case, the Windows native toolchain is unaware of the
      Cygwin <i>sandbox</i> and, instead, operates in the native Windows environment.
      The primary difficulties with this are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Paths</b>.
        Full paths for the native toolchain must follow Windows standards.
        For example, the path <code>/home/my\ name/nuttx/include</code> my have to be
        converted to something like <code>'C:\cygwin\home\my name\nuttx\include'</code>
        to be usable by the toolchain.
      </li>
      <p>
        Fortunately, this conversion is done simply using the <code>cygpath</code> utility.
      </p>
      <li>
        <b>Symbolic Links</b>
        NuttX depends on symbolic links to install platform-specific directories in the build system.
        On Linux, true symbolic links are used.
        On Cygwin, emulated symbolic links are used.
        Unfortunately, for native Windows applications that operate outside of the
        Cygwin <i>sandbox</i>, these symbolic links cannot be used.
      </li>
      <p>
        The NuttX make system works around this limitation by copying the platform
        specific directories in place.
        These copied directories make work a little more complex, but otherwise work well.
      </p>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: In this environment, it should be possible to use the NTFS <code>mklink</code> command to create links.
        This should only require a minor modification to the build scripts (see <code>tools/copydir.sh</code> script).
      </small></p>
      <li>
        <b>Dependencies</b>
        NuttX uses the GCC compiler's <code>-M</code> option to generate make dependencies.  These
        dependencies are retained in files called <code>Make.deps</code> throughout the system.
        For compilers other than GCC, there is no support for making dependencies in this way.
      </li>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: dependencies may be suppressed by setting the make variable <code>MKDEPS</code> to point
        to the do-nothing dependency script, <code>tools/mknulldeps.sh</code>.
      </small></p>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Supported Windows Native Toolchains</b>.
      At present, the following Windows native toolchains are in use:
      <ol>
        <li>GCC built for Windows (such as CodeSourcery, Atollic, devkitARM, etc.),</li>

        The build must be performed in a Windows console window.
        This may be using the standard <code>CMD.exe</code> terminal that comes with Windows.
        I prefer the ConEmu terminal which can be downloaded from:
        http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>GNUWin32</b>.
        The build still relies on some Unix-like commands.
        I usethe GNUWin32 tools that can be downloaded from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/.
        See the top-level <code>nuttx/README.txt</code> file for some download, build, and installation notes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>MinGW-GCC</b>.
        MinGW-GCC is used to compiler the C tools in the <code>nuttx/tools</code> directory that are neede by the build.
        MinGW-GCC can be downloaded from http://www.mingw.org/.
        If you are using GNUWin32, then it is recommended that you not install the optional MSYS components as there may be conflicts.

         &quot;I've installed ZDS-II 5.1.1 (IDE for ez80-based boards) on wine (windows emulator for UNIX) and to my surprise, not many changes were needed to make GIT snapshot of NuttX buildable...

         One remark is necessary: NuttX makefiles for ez80 are referencing <code>cygpath</code> utility.
         Wine provides similar thing called <code>winepath</code> which is compatible and offers compatible syntax.
         To use that, <code>winepath</code> (which itself is a shell script) has to be copied as <code>cygpath</code> somewhere in <code>$PATH</code>, and edited as in following patch:

      utilities that are compatible with GNU make, then it is very
      likely that NuttX would work in that environment as well (with some
      porting effort). If GNU make is not supported, then some significant
      modification of the Make system would be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MSYS</b>.
      I have not used MSYS but what I gather from talking with NuttX users is that MSYS can be used as an alternative to Cygwin in any of the above Cygwin environments.
      This is not surprising since MSYS is based on an older version of Cygwin (cygwin-1.3).
      MSYS has been modified, however, to interoperate in the Windows environment better than Cygwin and that may be of value to some users.
    </p>
    <p>
      MSYS, however, cannot be used with the native Windows NuttX build because it will invoke the MSYS bash shell instead of the <code>CMD.exe</code> shell.
      Use GNUWin32 in the native Windows build envionment.
