<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  Nuttx is a real timed embedded operating system (RTOS).
  Its goals are:
<p>
<ol>
  <li>A very small footprint usable in all but the tightest micro-controller environments,</li>
  <li>Fully scalable from tiny (8-bit) to moderate embedded (32-bit),</li>
  <li>High degree of standards compliance.</li>
  <li>Totally open.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Supported Platforms</h1>

<ul>
<li><b>x86 Linux Simulation</b>.  Fully functional.</li>
<li>TI <b>TMS320C5471</b> (also called <b>TMS320DM180</b>).
    NuttX operates on the ARM7 of this dual core processor.
    This port uses the <a href="http://www.spectrumdigital.com/">Spectrum Digital</a>
    evaluation board with a GNU arm-elf toolchain*.
    This port is in progress and partially functional (However,
    my board is dead at the moment so it will be awhile before I fix it)</li>
<li><b>8051 Microcontroller</b>.
    This port uses the <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/">PJRC</a> 87C52 development system
    and the <a href="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/">SDCC</a> toolchain.
    This port will require a few more weeks before it is ready for time prime.</li>
<li><b>Motorola (Freescale) MC68HC908GP32 Microcontroller</b>.
    Using the Axiom CMS8GP32 development board.
    This is next in the queue.</li?
<li><b>Other ports</b>.
    I also have partial ports for the TI TMS320DM270 and for MIPS. 
</ul>

<blockquote>* A highly modified <a href="http://buildroot.uclibc.org/">buildroot</a>
is available that be used to build a NuttX-compatible arm-elf toolchain.</blockquote>

<h1>Memory Footprint</h1>

<p>Details to be provided</p>

<p>
  I have a complete build for an ARM7 target that includes most of the OS
  features and a broad range of OS tests.
  That builds to an executable that requires about 85Kb for .text, .data., and .bss.
</p>
<p>
  I have a stripped down OS test for the 8051 target that requires only
  24Kb.

<p>NuttX is available under the highly permissive
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license">BSD license</a>.
  Other than some fine print that you agree to respect my copyright
  you should feel absolutely free to use NuttX in any environment and
  without any concern for jeopardizing any proprietary software that
