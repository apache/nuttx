NuttX-6.17
----------

The 84th release of NuttX, Version 6.17, was made on April 14, 2012,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website. Note
that release consists of two tarballs: nuttx-6.17.tar.gz and
apps-6.17.tar.gz. Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

This release corresponds with SVN release number: r4607

New features and extended functionality:

* Networking: Additional low-level, thread-independent socket
interfaces (for NFS client support).

* RTC: Added a new interface call clock_synchronize(). This function
will reload the system time from an RTC and is required when the
system re-awakens from certain deep-sleep modes.

* Graphics: Add NxConsole. This is a character device driver that
wraps an NX window and can be re-directed for stdout. This allows,
for example, a pop-up graphics window that contains a NuttShell (NSH)
session. A test of NxConsole is available at apps/examples/nxconsole.

* Watchdog Drivers: Added an interface definition an "upper half"
driver to support watchdog timers.

* Calypso: Support for TI Calypso-based cellphones (as supported by
the Osmocom-BB project) was contributed by members of the Osmocom-BB
team. This includes configurations for the Compal e88 and e99 phones.

* USB Device Interface: Needed to extend the USB device interface
because there was no mechanism for passing endpoint OUT data that
may need to accompany a setup request.

* STM32 drivers: Added some power management controls for entering
reduced power consumption states. An OTG FS driver was completed
and partially verified (this driver seems to be functional but since
it has been test so lightly, it might better be listed in the
next section "Work in progress").

* PIC32 drivers: The PIC32 Ethernet driver is now stable. The PIC32
USB device controller driver is now functional (but not yet stable).

* PIC32 boards: Added support for the Sure DB-DP11212 PIC32 General
Purpose Demo Board. There is now a PIC32 Starter Kit that
provides NSH only through a Telnet connection.

* Build System: Some header files were moved into include/nuttx.
The goal is to move any non-standard header files to include/nuttx
or include/arch. Moved include/math.h to include/nuttx/math.h;
this file is now only instantiated as the 'system' math.h if
CONFIG_ARCH_MATH_H=y is defined.

* Tools: Added tools/cmpconfig.c, a tool for comparing two
configuration files.

Work in progress. This release includes some partially completed
work that is still not ready for prime time.

* NFS Client: Work is progressing on support for an NFS client
file system. This is a port of the BSD NFS client file system
that is being done by Jose Pablo Rojas V.

* Automated Configuration: Automated configuration based on the
kconfig-frontends tool is being incorporated into the build
system. The configuration is still not complete enough for
general use in this release.

* STM32 Drivers: Added files that will (eventually) hold an STM32
OTG FS host driver. This is still a work in progress.

Bugfixes:

* Networking: Corrected a deadlock that only occurred when
executing the NSH 'ifconfig' command over Telnet.

* File system: Fix incorrect return errno value from read() when
the file is opened write-only.

* Graphics: Fix several compilation errors that have crept into the
multi-user NX server because of lack of use.

* STM32: In order to use CAN2, both CAN1 and CAN2 clocking must be
enabled. Fixed a troublesome bug in the STM32 F4 I2C driver that
resulting in timeouts.

* LPC17xx: Fixes for errors the crept in the LPC17xx DAC logic
Contributed by Lzyy).

* Build System: Reordered the link command line to account for new
versions of libgcc.a that require symbols from the application
(abort()).
