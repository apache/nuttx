NuttX-6.3
---------

The 70th release of NuttX follows only a nines days after the release
of version 6.2. It was released on May 15, 2011. This special
back-to-back release was made so that the current released version
of NuttX will correspond to the initial release from the RGMP
project.

This release adds architecture support and build configuration for
RGMP. RGMP is a project for running GPOS and RTOS simultaneously
on multi-processor platforms. See
http://rgmp.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page for further
information about RGMP.

This release also includes support for STM32 FLASH, build improvements,
and initial, incomplete support for the MicroChip PIC32MX MCU. Bug
fixes are included for some build problems, USB host class driver
error handling, NX graphics color mapping, and problems with C
standard I/O buffer flushing. See the ChangeLog for further details.
