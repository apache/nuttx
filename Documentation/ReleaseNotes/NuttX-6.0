NuttX-6.0
---------

The 67th release of NuttX, Version 6.0, was made on March 21, 2011
and is available for download from the SourceForge website. The
version number of this release was bumped from 5.19 to 6.0. A
change in the major revision number is used to reflect an incompatibility
with previous versions. In this release, the NuttX core OS
functionality has been separated from NuttX application-related
functionality. These are provided as separate tarballs:

* nuttx-6.0.tar.gz, and
* apps-6.0.tar.gz

The purpose of this separation is both to better organize and
modularize the NuttX source tree, but also to provide better support
for incorporation of end-user applications with NuttX.

The incompatibility results from the changes to the board configuration
logic needed to supported the separable application. The major
changes to the configuration include:

* CONFIG_APPS_DIR - This should not be set. The default is
../apps. This should only be set if you have a custom,
product-specific application directory in some different location.

* appconfig - Each board configuration now requires a new file
called 'appconfig.' As its name suggests, this file provides
new configuration information needed by the logic in ../apps.

In addition to this major reorganization in the directory structure,
this release also includes some important extensions to existing
features and some important bugfixes. These include:

* The SLIP driver was been well debugged and significantly
re-designed. Now you can have an Ethernet connection to you
board even if you have no Ethernet hardware. How cool is that?

* The QEMU i486 port is now functional. It has also been reported
to work on the Bifferboard (see http://bifferos.bizhat.com/).

* And extensions to the uIP driver interface, and

* Bug fixes to fopen() and STM32 GPIO configuration

Please see the ChangeLog for details.
