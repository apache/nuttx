NuttX-6.15
----------

The 82nd release of NuttX, Version 6.15, was made on February 12, 2012,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website. Note
that release consists of two tarballs: nuttx-6.15.tar.gz and
apps-6.15.tar.gz. Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

This release corresponds with SVN release number: r4387

New features and extended functionality:

* General Drivers: Add support for (29-bit) extended CAN IDs. Add an
infrastructure to support battery drivers. Add a driver for MAX17040x
battery "fuel gauge". Add support for Composite USB drivers (in
particular for a CDC/ACM with MSC USB composite driver).

Added a new RAM logging driver. This will allow debug output into
a RAM buffer associated with a character driver at /dev/ramlog.
Added the new command 'dmesg' to NSH that can be used to dump the
current contents of the log. This is useful for systems that do not
have the usual serial console (for example, if you only have a
Telnet console with NSH).

* Networking: Add a lower level, primitive socket interface. Telnet
driver:

A New Telnet daemon was created. It wraps a Telnet session within a
character driver that can serve as a "controlling terminal." The
Telnet session will then be inherited by tasks created from the
Telnet session and the stdin/stdout from the created task will
still go through the same Telnet connection.

* STM32 Drivers. PWM driver pulse count was limited to 128; now is
(essentially) unlimited. Add support for (29-bit) extended CAN IDs.
Add support for I2C3. The SDIO driver is (mostly) verified on the
STM32 F4 platforms.

* LPC17xx Drivers. Extended the CAN driver so that the TSEG1 and TSEG2
bit times can be set via the NuttX configuration. Add support for
(29-bit) extended CAN IDs.

* PIC32 Drivers. The PIC32 Ethernet driver is code complete (but still
untested).

* FTPD. Add a new FTP server daemon. This is based loosely on
the hwport_ftpd library provided by Jaehyuk Cho.

* Library: Add support for on_exit(). Implemented tcsetattr() and
tcgetattr(). Moved the old, too-smart fgets() to a new application
library function called readline(). Dumbed down the original fgets().
Add strcasestr(), avsprintf(), inet_ntop(), and inet_pton().
Add support to enable or disable debug output.

* Build system: Support for building a 32-bit simulation executable on
a 64-bit Linux machine. Correct a dependency issue in the arch/*/src/board
directory.

Bugfixes:

* System: Correct PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER

* FAT: Fix an error in the FAT statfs() reported by David Sidrane.

* STM32: Fix clock frequencies for APB2 timers. Correct AFIO register
offset.

* PIC32. Correct GPIOs used for LEDs on the Sure PIC32MX board.

* NSH. Wait for a USB connection if a USB serial class is used to
interface with the host.

Additional bugfixes, name changes, and other differences as detailed in the
ChangeLog.
