NuttX-6.19
----------

The 86th release of NuttX, Version 6.19, was made on June 15, 2012,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website. Note
that release consists of two tarballs: nuttx-6.19.tar.gz and
apps-6.19.tar.gz. Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

This release corresponds with SVN release number: r4847

This release features new support for a Network File System (NFS) client.
This feature allows a tiny, embedded MCU to mount a remote file system
exported by an NFS server and then to access the file system as it would
any local file system. Then the tiny MCU can effectively have terabytes
of storage!

This might be useful for data collection, for MCU configuration information,
for software updates, for providing modular, loadable code modes, controlling
a "farm" of MCUs, ... there are many possibilities and opportunities for
innovation!

The NuttShell (NSH) now supports the following command:

nfsmount <server-address> <mount-point> <remote-path>

That command will mount the remote NFS server directory <remote-path> at
<mount-point> on the target machine. <server-address> is the IP address of
the remote server.

The NFS development was the graduation project of Jose Pablo Rojas V. who
is a student at the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Costa Rica (ITCR, or TEC).
A lot of effort went into understanding what a tiny, embedded NFS client should
do and getting the target resource usage to a bare minimum. Only around a
kilobyte or so of memory is required to run the NFS client (and most of that
for I/O buffers). Jose Pablo has spent several months living with NFS and
should be congratulated.

Additional new features and extended functionality:

* Drivers: SSD1289 LCD driver, MIO283QT2 LCD driver

* LM3S: Additional register definition header files (contributed by Max
Neklyudov).

* STM32 Boards: The STM32F4Discovery will now support an SSD1289 LCD,
The STM3220G-EVAL board support is now equivalent to the STM3240G-EVAL
board support.

* PIC32 Boards: The Mikroelektronika PIC32MX7 MMB board port is now
functional, very complete, and stable.

* Graphics: The NxConsole will now take keyboard input from the NX graphics
subsystem. This means that if there are multiple NxConsole windows, only
the top instance that has focus will receive the keyboard input.

* apps/: Add the capability to use an arbitrary USB device as the console
(not necessarily /dev/console). Additional enhancements for USB consoles.
Added the 'mv' command.

Work in progress. This release includes some partially completed
work that is still not ready for prime time.

* Automated Configuration. Automated configuration based on the
kconfig-frontends tool is being incorporated into the build
system. The configuration is still not complete enough for
general use in this release.

* STM32 Drivers. Added files that will (eventually) hold an STM32
OTG FS host driver. This is still a work in progress.

Bugfixes (see the change log for details) :

* General: sleep() and usleep() return values, sig_timedwait() errno setting
on timeout.
* Drivers: STMPE811 touchscreen driver, USB PLC2303, USB CDC/ACM
* STM32: Several USB device controller driver fixes, F4 interrupt priorities
(contributed by Mike Smith).
* Graphics: Keyboard input, fill trapezoid bug

As well as other, less critical bugs (see the ChangeLog for details)
