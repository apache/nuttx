NuttX-0.4.2
-----------

This is the 34th release of NuttX. This release adds no new OS
features but does include support for two new architectures:

* ez80Acclaim! Basic support has been integrated and verified
for the ez80f910200zcog-d board (eZ80F91-based). That basic
support includes timer interrupts and serial console. Ongoing
work includes an EMAC driver that should be integrated for the
next release nuttx-0.4.2. eZ80Acclaim! support has been in the
code base for some time, but has only just been integrated due
to toolchain issues.

* Renesas M16C/20. Support for the Renesas SKP16C20 board has
been included in the NuttX source tree. However, as the
eZ80Acclaim!, testing and integration of that port is stalled
due to toolchain issues.

These changes were verified only on the ZiLOG eZ80910200zcog-d
board. Please report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from February 28, 2009.
