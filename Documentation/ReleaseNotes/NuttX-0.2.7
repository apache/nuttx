NuttX-0.2.7
-----------

This is the 10th release of NuttX. This is primarily a bugfix
release to correct a number of problems reported to me (thanks
Didier!). This release does include the final changes complete the
FAT filesystem logic including stat(), statfs(), and non-standard
APIs to manage FAT attributes. At present, FAT long file names and
file truncate() are still not supported.

See the ChangeLog for a complete list of changes.

This release has been verified only on the Linux user-mode platform.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from June 9, 2007.
