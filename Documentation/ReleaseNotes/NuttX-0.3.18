NuttX-0.3.18
------------

This is the 30th release of NuttX. This release includes two
partially completed ports, several new features, and a couple of
important bug fixes. The two partially completed ports are:

* The STMicro STR71x processor and configuration for the Olimex
STR-P711 board.
* The Hitachi SH-1 using the SH1_LCEVB1 (SH-1/US7032EVB1) board

Progress on these ports is stalled (as detailed in the ChangeLog).

The new features focus primarily on management of block devices and
extensions of the NuttShell (NSH). These include:

* A loop device that converts a file into a block device.
* A block to character (BCH) driver that allow access a block device as
if it were character device.
* Added strcasecmp() and strncasecmp() libc functions.
* Added the 'dd' and 'losetup' commands to NSH. These commands
(along with mkfatfs and mount), give good management of filesystems
on the target.

Several bugs were fixed, the most important of which are:

* Fixed a race condition workaround delay in LPC214X SPI logic.
This was also the cause of some bad MMC/SD performance on that
platform.

* Fixed a recently introduced FAT file system problem: It would
mount a (invalid) FAT file system even if the medium is not formatted!

* Corrected two other important errors in the FAT lseek() implementation:
1 - The sectors-per-cluster value was being reset to "1".
2 - Important lseek logic was omitted when the seek position was zero.

The FAT filesystem has had many bugs fixed in it and, I think, is
now maturing and becoming stable.

These changes were verified only on the mcu123.com NXP LPC2148
board, the Hitachi SH1_LCEVB1 board, and the Linux simulator, all
using a Linux development environment. Please report any errors
to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from November 16, 2008.
