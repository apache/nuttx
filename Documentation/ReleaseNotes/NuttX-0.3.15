NuttX-0.3.15
-----------

This is the 27th release of NuttX. This release includes some new features:

* Adds support for the ROMFS filesystem
* ROMFS supports mmap() to provide eXecute In Place (XIP) capability
* NuttShell (NSH) can be configured to use ROMFS to provide a tiny read-only
filesystem with a startup script in /etc.
* Completed the basic port of the NXP LPC2148 on the mcu123.com board.
The basic port includes successful booting, timer interrupts,
serial console, successfully passing the examples/ostest, and a
NuttShell (NSH) configuration.

These changes were verified only on the mcu123.com NXP LPC2148
board. Please report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from September 20, 2008.
