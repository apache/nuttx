NuttX-5.19
----------

The 66th release of NuttX, Version 5.19, was made on March 12, 2011
and is available for download from the SourceForge website. This
release includes several new features in various states of integration
and maturity:

* 486SX QEMU port. This port supports the Intel 486SX architecture
using the QEMU simulator. Initial functionality is in place a
partially tested. There are still some outstanding issues with
timer interrupts.
* Platform specific application support. A new apps/ directory
appears in this port. This apps/ directory provides a mechanism
for applications using NuttX to have a highly customized
initialization process. It supports a set of end-user applications
than can be executed (1) standalone so you can have a fully
customized application startup, or (2) on top of NSH. Think
of it this way: In a buckled-up embedded application, your
end-user programs will probably have their own dedicated start-up
logic. But, during development, you might want to have you
applications available and executable from the NSH command line.
This apps/ add-on (and NSH hooks) was contributed by Uros to
accomplish just that.
* NSH was also extended to support application specific ROMFS
/etc/init.d/rcS start-up scripts. This feature, as well, as
all of the above-mentioned apps/ directory support was contributed
by Uros Platise
* Additional NSH improvements and bug fixes. See the Changelog
for details.
* This release also provides a new SLIP network driver. This
driver should support point-to-point network communications to
a host using TCP/IP or UDP. This driver is code complete, but
not tested in this release.
* New RAMTRON FRAM driver (contributed by Uros Platise)
* New generic 16550 UART driver.
* Cortex-M3 Power improvements: Waits for Interrupt (WFI) in idle
loop for reduced power consumption (LPC17xx and STM32 only -
contributed by Uros Platise))
* New waitpid() system interface.
* Additional bugfixes: pipes, stdint.h, STM32 SDIO and SPI drivers
