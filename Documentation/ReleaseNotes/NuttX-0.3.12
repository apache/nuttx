NuttX-0.3.12
------------

This is the 24th release of NuttX. This release includes some minor
bugfixes as well as a few new features. Bugs fixed include:

* Corrected an error in recursive mutex implementation.
* task_create() was only dup()ing the first three file descriptors.
* Fixed driver open reference counting errors in dup(), dup2(), and exit().
* Fixed error handling logic in fflush().

New features were also added:

* Pipes and pipe() API
* FIFOs and mkfifo() API
* mkfatfs() API can be used to format FAT file systems.

These changes were verified only on the Host simulator under Cygwin.
Please report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from August 10, 2008.
