NuttX-0.4.3
-----------

This is the 35th release of NuttX. This release one important new
OS feature and corrects and extends the eZ80 port:

* Priority Inheritance. The basic NuttX waiting logic was extended
to support priority inheritance. See the NuttX User Manual for
further information:
http://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/reference/user/05_counting_semaphore.html.

* ez80Acclaim! Corrected several critical, show-stopping bugs on that
platform including:
- Errors in the serial driver interrupts.
- An error in the eZ80 table.
* eZ80Acclaim!: Completed integration of the eZ80F91 EMAC driver.

These changes were verified only on the ZiLOG eZ80910200zcog-d board
and on Cygwin-based simulation platform in various configurations.
Please report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from March 13, 2009.
