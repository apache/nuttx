- Semaphores: Fix a bad assertion in priority inheritance logic.
The comments state correctly that we cannot make any assumptions
about the number of holders of the semaphore, yet the code
asserts if there are any holders. This makes the code behave
closer to what the comments say. From Gregory Nutt.
- Memory Manager: Fix error that occurs when CONFIG_CPP_HAVE_VARARGS
is not defined. In that case, the arguments to the debug macro will
all be evaluated even though they are not used any variables that
are references must at least be defined. From Gregory Nutt.
- System Calls: Adapt the conditional compile logic on when to
include the vfork() syscall proxy and stub to the logic used for
vfork() itself. From Michael Jung.
- System Calls: Fixed SYS_mount syscall define when CONFIG_FS_READABLE
is undefined. From Joao Matos.
- waitpid(): In waitpid, remember to grab the exited child ptr. After
being unblocked in waitpid, the child pointer might be NULL. Modify
to use group_exitchild to get the pointer of recent exited child.
From Yang ChungFan.

* File System/Block and MTD Drivers:

- MMC/SD: Fixes bug where thread gets deadlocked due to recursive call
and addresses comment regarding events. When initializing the
MMCSD, if we are being told there is a card, but we fail to
initialize it, we should not re-register for an insertion event as
this will immediately cause us to call in again. Instead, we should
register for a removal event and wait for the card to be removed and
re-inserted. From Anthony Merlino.

* Networking/Network Drivers:

- UsrSock: Fix debug logs and remove DEBUGASSERT from
usrsockdev_do_request(). In a client mode, socket() will be the
first request for usrsockdev_do_request(). However, in a server
mode, the first request to accepted sockets will be recv() or other
which depend on applications. So I think we should remove thi
DEBUGASSERT from usrsockdev_do_request(). From Masayuki Ishikawa.
- ICMPV6 Autoconfig: Use ntohs() to convert IPv6 address from
network to host order int network debug output. From Bernd Walter.
- TCP Buffering: Fix TCP buffer send deadlock in iob_copyin() when
IOB buffers are exhausted and network lock is taken. From
Valmantas Paliksa.
- TCP Close: Fix TCP active close in inet_close.c. In previous
implementation, FIN packet was not sent when a socket is actively
closed (e.g. telnetd or webserver) without SO_LINGER. This issue
happens because the socket closing sequence waits for the
status.cl_sem only if lingering timeout is set. However, in many
server use-cases, SO_LINGER is not usually set and even in these
cases, FIN packet must be sent correctly. This changes the logic
in inet_close.c so that it can wait for status.cl_sem regardless
of SO_LINGER. Instead, if SO_LINGERis set, it waits for the
semaphore with timeout option. From Masayuki Ishikawa.
- UDP: Fix C89 compatibility problem. Empty initializers are not
permitted. Caused eZ80 build failure. From Gregory Nutt.
- Telnet: Fix a C89 non-compliance that was breaking the eZ80 build.
From Gregory Nutt.

* Wireless/Wireless Drivers:

- NRF24L01: Fix NRF24L01_NCMDS in ioctl.h. The last one in
nrf24l01.h is _WLCIOC(NRF24L01_FIRST + 15) From Masayuki Ishikawa.
- NRF24L01: Fix PIPENO/PKTLEN bitmask in RX FIFO header. In RX FIFO
header, the first byte should use 5 lsb to store PKTLEN and 3 msb
to store PIPENO. However, FIFO_PIPENO_SHIFT was set to 4 which
causes the lsb of pipe number to interfere with the received packet
size stored in the FIFO. This fix RX corruption when using pipe
number > 0. From Federico Braghiroli.

* Graphics/Display Drivers:

- Raising Windows: Fix a critical list handling bug in the graphics
system. When a lower-level window was raised while a model window
was in place, then list corruption could occur. From Gregory Nutt.

* Common Drivers:

- Serial: Limit the number of times that the poll semaphore is
incremented. From Dave Marples.
- USB Host: Remove duplicate const in USB Host files. From Adam
Porter.
- USB Host Composite: Class-specific descriptors were not available
if the interface is part of a composite device, since only interface
and endpoint descriptors are copied by usbhost_copyinterface().
This change will copy any class-specific interface descriptors for
use in downstream class drivers. The loop was aborting due to
finding two interface descriptors back-to-back. From Adam Porter.
- USB Host Composite: The cfgdesc pointer was initialized after the
buffer had been advanced, so it was not pointing where it should.
The totallen operations at the end of the function ended up
overwriting memory belonging to the first copied interface
descriptor. From Adam Porter.
- USB MSC: Fix usbmsc_exportluns declaration. Fixes the following
error "...undefined reference to `usbmsc_exportluns'". From Alin
Jerpelea.

* Architecture Common:

- Rename all arch/<family>/src/<chip>/chip directories to
arch/<family>/src/<chip>/hardware. This eliminates a name collision
that is usually harmless but does cause problems at the time. The
problem is because the include path includes '.' and 'chip/.',
therefore an inclusion like '#include <chip/mcu_header.h' can be
ambiguous if a file named mcu_header.h exists in both at both
arch/<family>/src/<chip>/chip and at arch/<family>/src/chip/chip.
From Gregory Nutt.

* Board Common:

- Default Configurations: Update configurations for changes to
apps/netutils/netinit configuration. MAC address configuration
was represented by type long long. That is a problem for
architectures that do not support type long long. Replaces by
two long configuration items. From
Gregory Nutt.
- Default Configurations: Change CONFIG_NSH_MACADDR to
CONFIG_NETINIT_MACADDR From Masayuki Ishikawa.
- Default Configurations: Fix mac address settings for RNDIS.
Recently CONFIG_NETINIT_MACADDR_2 and CONFIG_NETINIT_MACADDR_1 were
newly introduced instead of CONFIG_NETINIT_MACADDR. This change
conforms to this change. From Masayuki Ishikawa.
- Default Configurations: Kconfig files should not select
SCHED_WORKQUEUE since that is really only is only the logical OR if
SCHED_LPWORK and SCHED_HPWORK. Selecting it has no effect other
than to produce an erroneous configuration. From Gregory Nutt.
- Linker Scripts: Make sure sections are aligned to 32-bits in all LD
linker scripts. This fixes and issues noted specifically for the
SAMD21 by Bernd Walter, but should be applicable to all other LD
scripts as well.
- Linker Scripts: Add . = ALIGN(4); before every .data section,
add . = ALIGN(4); before every ARM.extab section, add . = ALIGN(4);
before every definition of __exidx_start, add . = ALIGN(4); before
every .init_section. Convert TABs to spaces in all ld linker
scripts. This just makes things easier to modify with scripts
because the files are more consistent. From Gregory Nutt.
- configs/Board.mk: Cannot call $(AR) directly. That works only with
GCC. It must, instead use the ARCHIVE command from Config.mk as do
other Makefiles. From Gregory Nutt.

* MIPS32:

- Fix a copy-paste error. On vfork, the GP register was being set to
the new SP value vs. the context GP value. NOTED in Bitbucket issue
155. From Gregory Nutt.
- An older commit used CP0 register definitions that were not defined
in the NuttX cp0.h header file. Probably these were from the
Microchip hacked up GCC toolchain but are not generally available
outside that toolchain. Fix: Add definitions to NuttX cp0.h header
file. From Gregory Nutt.

* Microchip PIC32MZ Drivers:

- PIC32MZ GPIO: Use LAT instead of PORT when writing. From Ouss4.

* Microchip/Atmal SAM3/SAM4 Drivers:

- SAMD2/L2: Correct TC register bit field definitions used with
TC_CTRLBCLR and TC_CTRLSET registers. From Bernd Walter.

* NXP LPC17xx Boards:

- LPC17xx PROTECTED: On the LPC1769 there are two 16 KiB AHB SRAM
blocks, which are mapped back to back at physical address 0x2007C000
and 0x20080000 (i.e. right below and right above a 512 KiB boundary).
Memory from those two blocks is considered continuous when assigned
to a heap. In the protected build mode, when the memory protection
unit is used, though, it must be split into two MPU regions. This
is because MPU regions must be naturally aligned, and the 32KiB
continuous address space of the two 16KiB AHB SRAM blocks does not
start at an address divisible by 32KiB. The only other
configurations that use protected build mode on lpc17xx are
currently open1788/knsh and open1788/knxterm. The LPC1788 has the
AHB SRAM blocks mapped more sanely (from an MPU region point of
view), which is probably why no problems emerged here. Both still
compile with my change and other than wasting an MPU region (which
would otherwise remain unused) should work fine. That said, I
have no hardware to confirm. From Michael Jung.

* NXP LPC54xx Boards:

- LPCXpresso-LPC54628: Modify the TWM configurations to properly
inject keyboard data. This way, in the case of multiple NxTERMs,
only the NxTerm at the top of the hierarchy gets the keyboard input.
Otherwise, it is not possible to use multiple NxTerms with each the
keyboard input going to a different NxTerm window. From Gregory
Nutt.

* NXP i.MXRT Drivers:

- i.MXRT Serial: Fix serial TIOCSINVERT From David Sidrane.
- i.MXRT USDHC: USDHC Stopgap Fix for build breakage From David
Sidrane.
- i.MXRT USDHC: Fix compiler error for CONFIG_IMXRT_USDHC1 &&
!CONFIG_IMXRT_USDHC2 From David Sidrane.

* On Semiconductor LC823450:

- LC823450-XGEVK: Remove CPU assignment for LPWORK. This change will
reduce audio under-run when running dvfs auto mode. From Masayuki
Ishikawa.

* SiLabs EFM32 Drivers:

- EFM32 USB Host: Apply Adam Porter's STM32 fix to EFM32 which has
the same IP. From Gregory Nutt.

* STMicro STM32:

- STM32F1 Pinmap: Fix names for complementary PWM outputs From
Mateusz Szafoni.
- STM32L4: If SRAM3 is used as heap, do not power it off in stop 2
mode. From Juha Niskanen.

* STMicro STM32 Drivers:

- STM32 ADC: Fix a compilation error when verbose analog debugging is
enabled for the STM32 ADC. not all STM32s have an SQR4 register.
From rajan gill.
- STM32 PWM: Fix pulse count for the number of counts greater than 128.
From Mateusz Szafoni.
- STM32 USB OTG FS/HS Host: In stm32_ctrlout() in the HS and FS host
drivers, the data buffer isn't sent. This patch passes the buffer
and buflen to the stm32_ctrl_senddata() function. With this change,
I am able to send MBIM control messages to my USB modem, and read the
response. From Adam Porter.
- STM32L4 USB: Fix USB device PMA accesses. USB PMA accesses are
done as 16-bit words on STM32L4 instead of 32-bit words on STM32L1.
From Jussi Kivilinna.
- STM32L4 OTG FS/HS: Fix constant using in comparison to determine
endpoint is interrupt type. From Adam Porter.
- STM32F7 OTG FS/HS: Fix constant using in comparison to determine
endpoint is interrupt type. From Adam Porter.
- STM32H7 PWM: Fix pulse count for the number of counts greater than 128.
From Mateusz Szafoni.
- STM32H7 Serial: Fix error when SINGLEWIRE or
CONFIG_STM32H7_SERIALBRK_BSDCOMPAT defined. From David Sidrane.
- STM32H7 SPI: Correct a typo in condition compilation. From
Jonathan Richner.
- STM32H7 Timer: Fixed compile errors with TIM13, TIM14, TIM7. From
David Sidrane.
- STM32H7 USB OTG FS/HS: Fix constant using in comparison to determine
endpoint is interrupt type. From Adam Porter.
- STM32G0 Serial: Fix STM32G0 error when SINGLEWIRE or SERIALBRK_BSDCOMPAT
defined (it reflects previous changes in STM32H7). From Mateusz Szafoni.

* STMicro STM32 Boards:

- Nucleo-L432KC: Shorten some long lines, fix i2c pinout. From
Sebastien Lorquet.
- STM32L476VG-Disco: Fix an error in defconfig files because a line
in the rcS file was longer than the configured NSH command line.
From Juha Niskanen.
- STM32L4R9AI-Disco: Fix an error in defconfig files because a line
in the rcS file was longer than the configured NSH command line.
From Juha Niskanen.
- OmnibusF4: Correct naming of a configuration variable for ROMFS.
From Phil Coval.
- Olimex-STM32-E407: Change initialization to match the way it is
done with other boards. From Gregory Nutt.
- Olimex-STM32-E407 SPI: Add SPI initialization logic. From Juan
Flores.
- STM32F4-Discovery ROMFS: Missing colon in declaration of local
variable. From Phil Coval.
- STM32F4-Discovery ROMFS: Correct naming of a configuration variable
for ROMFS. From Phil Coval.
- STM32F4-Discovery Build: Fix .ARM.exidx section overlap Source:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30778614/arm-none-eabi-ld-section-arm-exidx-overlaps-section-data.
From Alan Carvalho de Assis.
- STM32F4-Discovery PROTECTED: Fix a problem with undefined symbol
'abort' from GCC library in PROTECTED build. Fix by moving libgcc
into recursive archive group between --start-group and --end-group.
Other kernel/Makefiles suffer from this same issue From Gregory
Nutt.
- Nucleo-H743ZI SPI: Correct typos in function naming. From Jonathan
Richner.

* TI AM335x:

- AM335x SYSCLK: Add a function to return a frequency of the system
clock. From Gregory Nutt.
- AM355x CM: Fix a typo in a macro name. From Gregory Nutt.
- AM355x LCD: Fix a few typos. Add things needed by the LCDC driver.
From Gregory Nutt.

* TI Tiva Drivers:

- Tiva Ethernet: Add a workaround for tiva with qemu. With qemu,
tiva_ifup() hangs because Ethernet link status can not be set
correctly. This change is a workaround to avoid this issue. From
Masayuki Ishikawa.

* TI Tiva Boards:

- TM4C1294-Launchpad: Fix syntax error in oocd.sh script. From
Nathan Hartman.

* ZiLOG Common:

- z80: up_addregion() must be prototyped in nuttx/mm/mm.h, not
up_internal.h. Various name changes to better conform to the coding
standard, naming conventions, and use by other architectures. From
Gregory Nutt.

* ZiLOG Z80 Boards:

- z80sim: Remove unused function up_earlyserialinit() from serial
driver. From Gregory Nutt.

* ZiLOG z16f ZNeo:

- z16f ZNeo: Replicate build changes make for eZ80 and z8 for ZNeo.
From Gregory Nutt.
- ZNeo compile fixes: Fix misuse of FAR which makes a difference on
this platform. Be consistent in use of WDOG_ID type. ZDS-II doesn't
like auto-conversions of struct wdog_s * to WDOG_ID (which is type
struct wdog_s *). From Gregory Nutt.

* ZiLOG eZ80Acclaim!:

- eZ80: Fix eZ80 compile problems due to New ZDS-II toolchain and
ongoing bit rot due to non-C89 code creeping into the core OS. From
Gregory Nutt.
- eZ80: Fix some backward conditional logic in Make.defs. From
Gregory Nutt.
- eZ80: Fix a logic error in vector initialization. From Gregory Nutt.

* C Library/Header Files:

- signal.h: Fix a C89 compliance problem that cause the eZ80 build to
fail. Empty structure and unions are not accepted by the compiler.
From Gregory Nutt.
- wqueue.h: Allow definitions even if work queues are not enabled.
This solves build failures when work queues are not enabled. From
Gregory Nutt.
- fixedmath.h: Regarding the single precision float to/from fixed
point conversions in fixedmath.h, I believe the floating point
literals should be appended with the letter 'f' to avoid (expensive)
conversions from single to double precision, and thereby also avoid
(expensive if done in SW) double point arithmetic (which is what is
happening upon inspection of my disassembly). From rajan gill.

- stdio: Fix long long usage in all of the newer printf-related
logic: The selection CONFIG_LIBC_LONG_LONG must be ignored if the
architecture does not support long long types. From Gregory Nutt.
- gm_time_r(): Spurious reorganization of a loop in gm_time_r() to
work around and ZDD-II internal compiler error. Might be a little
bigger now, but is also probably a more structured use of C. From
Gregory Nutt.
- Debug: For platforms whose CPP tool does not support a variable
number arguments to pre-processor macros, we may still need to build
the debug functions even when CONFIG_DEBUG_FEATURES is not selected.
For example, __alert() may be needed if CONFIG_ARCH_STACKDUMP is
set. From Gregory Nutt.

* Tools:

- tools/nxstyle.c: Fix error in conditional logic that was preventing
detection bad brace alignment. Add logic to handle alignment of
braces in data initializers which following slightly different
indentation rules. From Gregory Nutt.
- tools/mkexport.sh: The mcu sub-directory chip/ was renamed to
hardware/ in late May of 2019. The mkexport.sh script that copies
these files was not updated, however, until now. Noted by Alin
Jerpelea. From Gregory Nutt.

* NSH Library: apps/nshlib:

- apps/nshlib: Fix all places where cle() and readline() are used.
readline() returns EOF on a failure. cle() returns a negated errno
value. Checking only for EOF causes failures to be missed (and
infinite loops ensuing). From Valmantas Paliksa.
- nshlib/nsh_parse.c: Fix a warning about an uninitialized variable
from the ZDS-II compiler. From Gregory Nutt.
- apps/nshlib/nsh_ddcmd.c: Seemingly nonsense change but somehow
works around a compilation error using the ZDS-II toolchain. It
was claiming that vtbl was undefined indd_outfopen(). From Gregory
Nutt.

* Network Utilities: apps/netutils:

- apps/netutils/netinit: MAC address configuration was represented
by type long long. That is a problem for architectures that do not
support type long long. Replaces by two long configuration items.
From Gregory Nutt.
- apps/netutils/telnetd/telnetd_daemon.c: Fix a C89 violation that
caused the eZ80 build to fail. From Gregory Nutt.
- apps/netutils/json: Removed. Replaced with apps/netutils/cjson.
From Gregory Nutt.

* Graphics Utilities: apps/graphics:

- apps/graphics/twm4nx: Fix an uninitialized variable that was
causing toolbar buttons to randomly come up enabled or disabled.
Remove some unused event definitions. From Gregory Nutt.
- apps/graphics/twm4nx: Fix a calibration screen startup issue.
Make an initial calibration screen optional. From Gregory Nutt.
- apps/graphics/twm4nx: Revise logic to detect clicks on the
background image. The original implementation had some side
effects. From Gregory Nutt.
- apps/graphics/twm4nx: Remove some remaining stuff from TWM that
was never used. Menus need to close after the 'terminal' selection
is made. Otherwise, the menu can become buried under a newly open
menu and not easily recovered. From Gregory Nutt.
- apps/graphics/twm4ndx: Add a 'critical' bit to the eventID. While
resizing, all events will be ignore except those marked critical.
From Gregory Nutt
- apps/graphics/twm4nx: CBackground now brings up the main menu if
the background image is clicked. This makes the behavior the same
across all of the background except when an icon is clicked. From
Gregory Nutt.
- apps/graphics/twm4nx: Fix a bug in placement of icons on the
desktop. When many windows are displayed, a bug in the looping logic
could cause an infinite loop. From Gregory Nutt.
- apps/graphics/twm4nx: Fix some errors found when enabling NX
keyboard support. The most important being that the mouse and
keyboard drivers need to be opened non-blocking. From Gregory Nutt.
