NuttX-0.3.14
-----------

This is the 26th release of NuttX. This release includes some
important bugfixes as well as a few new features. Critical bugs
fixed include:

FAT FS:
* Fixed several critical bugs with regard to fat reading and
writing and FAT12 accesses. Basically the FAT FS only worked
with my tiny test files and test cases. A lot of stronger FAT
tested is still needed!
* Fixed another FAT bug in implementation of FAT lseek();
this prohibited correct random access to large files.

Network:
* Corrected a critical bug that may prevent recvfrom from receiving
packets from most remote UDP port numbers.
* Corrected an error in multi-threaded socket handling in send() and
sendto(). Outgoing data could overwrite incoming data.
* Corrected IP checksum calculation in ICMP and UDP message send logic.
* Corrected an error in send() timeout logic.

New features were also added:

Network:
* Added support for application access to ICMP protocol stacks
* Added ping request logic (net/uip).
* Added basic TFTP client logic (netutils/tftpc).

NuttShell (NSH):
* New commands: 'test', '[', 'ping', 'mkrd', 'xd', and TFTP 'get' and 'put'
See the new NuttShell User Guide for additional information.

Other less critical bugs were also fixed and other less important
features were were added. See the ChangeLog for details.

These changes were verified only on the Neuros OSD (ARM9). Please
report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from September 8, 2008.
