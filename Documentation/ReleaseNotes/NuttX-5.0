NuttX-5.0
---------

This is 47th release of NuttX and the successor to nuttx-4.14. This
major revision number has been incremented to indicate that an
incompatibility with previous nuttx releases has been introduced.
This version adopts standard fixed width integer names as specified
by the ANSI C99 standard. The core logic of NuttX is older than
that standard and did not conform to it.

If you have applications running on NuttX-4.14, those applications
should continue to build and execute without problem on NuttX-5.0.
However, if you have device drivers or other OS-internal logic, you
will probably have to make some minor changes to your code to use
this version. Below is a summary of those changes:

* If you include sys/types.h to get the non-standard, fixed width
integer types (uint32, uint16, ubyte, etc.), that is no longer
necessary.
* Instead, you will need to include stdint.h where the new fixed
width integer types are defined (uint32_t, uint16_t, uint8_t, etc).
* You will have to change all occurrences of the following types:

uint32 -> uint32_t
uint16 -> uint16_t
ubyte -> uint8_t
uint8 -> uint8_t
sint32 -> int32_t
sint16 -> int16_t
sint8 -> int8_t

* In addition, the non-standard type 'boolean' must replaced with
the standard type 'bool'. The type definition for 'bool' is in
stdbool.h

This change in typing caused small changes to many, many files. It
was verified that all configurations in the release still build
correctly (other than the SDCC-based configurations). Regression
testing was performed on a few configurations, but it is possible
that minor build issues still exist. (If you encounter any, please
let me know and I will help you to fix them.)

In the course of the regression testing, several important bugs
unrelated to the type changes were found and corrected.

* Fixed an important error in the RX FIFO handling logic of the
LM3S6918 Ethernet driver.
* Corrected the handling of TCP sequence numbers in the TCP stack.
* And other less important bugs as detailed in the ChangeLog.

The primary focus of this release was standards compatibility, but
a few new features were added including a (1) Flash Translation
Layer (FTL) that will support filesystems on a FLASH device and (2)
partial ports for the STM32F107VC and HCS12 C9S12NE64 MCUs. Those
ports are very incomplete as of this writing.
