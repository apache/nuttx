NuttX-0.3.6
-----------

This is the 18th release of NuttX. This release contains on a few
changes. The primary purpose of this release is to synchronize with
the release of the pascal-0.1.0 add-on package.

This release of NuttX includes the following changes:

* Fixes for use with SDCC compiler
* Added a simulated z80 target (arch/z80)
* Fix deadlock errors when using stdio but with no buffering
* Add support for the add-on Pascal P-Code interpreter (pcode/)
(see the pascal-0.1.0 package)

This release were verified only on the simulated Z80 and host
simulation targets. As usual, any feedback about bugs or suggestions
for improvement would be greatly appreciated.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from January 6, 2007.

====

There was an error in the initial 0.3.6 release that prevented
a successful build unless the Pascal add-on was present. The
tarball was patched to include the fix. Make sure that you download
the nuttx-0.3.6.1.tar.gz version to avoid this problem.
