NuttX-7.22
----------

The 122nd release of NuttX, Version 7.22, was made on September 9, 2017,
and is available for download from the Bitbucket.org website. Note
that release consists of two tarballs: nuttx-7.22.tar.gz and
apps-7.22.tar.gz. These are available from:

https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/downloads
https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/apps/downloads

Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt file for build
information).

Additional new features and extended functionality:

* Core OS:

- pthreads: Move functions from sched/pthreads to libc/pthreads. These
functions just coordinate other OS interface calls but are not a
fundamental OS interfaces and, hence, do not belong within the OS:
pthread_yield(), pthread_once(), pthread_cond_init(),
pthread_cond_destroy(), pthread_barrier_init(),
pthread_barrier_destroy(), and pthread_barrier_wait().
- Add power-related debug output.

* File Systems/Block and MTD Drivers

- RAMTRON: Add support for splitting block writes in chunks. Some
Re-RAMs like MB85AS4MT have a write buffer size limitation. From
Boris Astardzhiev.
- MTD: Add driver for Macronix QuadSPI flash memory. From Simon Piriou.

* Graphics/Display Drivers:

- SSD1306 LCD Driver: (1) Separate lcd_dev_s setup to separate object.
g_oleddev takes 1 KiB because framebuffer and was allocated to .data
section because of lcd_dev_s function pointer setup. Move lcd_dev_s
setup out, so that g_oleddev goes to .bss and avoid wasting ROM. (2)
Fix memory corruption caused by ssd1306_getrun(). ssd1306_getrun was
writing one extra byte (with value 0) past target buffer when pixlen
is multiple of 8. When pixlen was not multiple of 8, last byte of
buffer was fully cleared, instead of modifying only the (pixlen % 8)
bits of last byte. (3) Add support for board power control.
ThingseeOne has regulator for controlling display power on/off. Patch
adds support for board based power control to SSD1306 driver. (4) Add
DD-12864WO-4A/SSD1309 support to SSD1306 driver. From Jussi Kivilinna.

* Networking/Network Drivers:

- Sockets: Support listening sockets in the getsockname() function.
From Roland Takacs.
- IP Forwarding: At the IP level, network may be configured to forward
IP packets that are not destined for the target through a different
network device, decrementing the packet TTL.
- IP forwarding: Add optional support to forward broadcast and
multicast packets. Add missing ICMP support.
- ICMPv6: Add 6LoWPAN and IP forwarding support.
- ICMPv6: Support source link-layer address option in RA. From
Masayuki Ishikawa.
- TUN Driver: Add definitions that will permit TUN-only networking.
- Socket I/F: Created a socket interface used to provide socket support.
Each address family has an interface that describes how to perform
socket operations on that address family. Currently only a couple of
methods are defined in the socket interface call table
- Remove CONFIG_NET_MULTILINK. This increases code size by a little,
but greatly reduces the complexity of the network code.
- Network procfs: Add support for routing tables at proc/net/route.
- Network procfs: Add support for network procfs statistics for the
PF_IEEE802154 address family.
- Network Driver Backlog: Remove driver based backlog support. This
affects the entire network, but is used by only one driver. The only
supported RX backlog is now via common read-ahead buffering.

* Wireless Networking/Wireless Drivers:

- IEEE 802.15.4 MAC / MRF24J60 Driver: Extensive updates for
association/beacon-enabled networks. From Anthony Merlino.
- IEEE 802.15.4 MAC / MRF24J60 Driver: Hook in setdevmode from newly
added radio attribute setting. From Anthony Merlino.
- IEEE 802.15.4 MAC: Supports get request for coordinator address. From
Anthony Merlino.
- IEEE 802.15.4 MAC: Notify radio layer of changes in devmode. From
Anthony Merlino.
- IEEE 802.15.4: Add special attribute that can be used to perform a
regdump of the radio. From Anthony Merlino.
- IEEE 802.15.4 loopback driver: Better simulation addressing: short
and extended addresses, panid, and IP address conversion.
- IEEE 802.15.4 Network Driver: Add logic to setup the network mask,
update the MAC-based IPv6 addressing when the network is brought up.
The idea is that addressing changes are supposed to occur only while
the network is down but won't take effect until the network is up
again.
- PktRadio: Add an infrastructure to support networking on generic
(non-IEEE 802.15.4) packet radios.
- PktRadio Loopback Driver: Add a PktRadio loopback network driver to
testing testing with 6LoWPAN and PktRadios on the simulator.
- Spirit Network Driver: The Spirit1 radio (SPSGRF-915) is the first
generic PktRadio Network driver. Based on STMicros STack packets
with 8-bit addressing. We need to use the STack packets in order to
provide the source address and automatic ACKing.
- Network procfs: Fix so that PktRadio address are shown correctly.
- Networking: Add support for some packet radio IOCTL commands.
- 6LoWPAN: Added handling for TCP and ICMPv6 packets.
- 6LoWPAN: Add configurable support for 6LoWPAN star topology. With
this change, the endpoints which are the 'points' of the star will
forward all traffic to the coordinator. The coordinator is assumed to
be the 'hub' of the star. This function also used IPv6 forwarding.
- 6LoWPAN: The original, Contiki-based design used only a single buffer
for reassemblying larger packets. This could be a problem issue for
hub configurations which really need the capability concurrently
reassemble multiple incoming streams concurrently. These was also a
design issue in that the reassembly buffer could be corrupted by
outgoing packets. The design was extended to support multiple
reassembly buffers, each associated with the reassembly tag and source
address. This assures that there can be be no corruption of the
reassembly once it has started.
- 6LoWPAN PktRadio: Now radio agnostic. All IEEE 802.15.4 dependencies
have been removed or isolated so that 6LoWPAN can be used with any
kind of packet radio. This involved things like: (1) generalizing
the representation of radio MAC meta-data, (2) changes to handle
variable-length radio addresses, (3) removal of all explicit IEEE
802.15.4 types, references, and interfaces, (4) a new radio driver
interface to return 'capabilities' of the driver.
- ICMPv6: Update so that ICMPv6 can be used with 6LoWPAN.
- IPv6 Neighbor: Update table format to support IEEE 802.15.4 MAC
addresses.
- PF_IEEE802154 Address Family: Add support for the PF_IEEE802154
address family socket type. This socket is similar to the PF_PACKET,
"raw" packet address family except that: (1) it supports only
SOCK_DRAM, not SOCK_RAW, and (2) works only with IEEE 802.15.4
MAC-based radios. This address family permits simple access to IEEE
802.15.4 IOCTLs and frame-level network transfers.

* Other Common Device Drivers:

- Dynamically configurable USB composite devices: We developed a huge
Changeset over a year ago to make USB Composite configuration
dynamical and be able to instantiate the CDC/ACM multiple times inside

local register access operations to allow more than 16-bit registers.
From Sebastien Lorquet .
- STM32 F4: Add support for STM32F433RC. From Alan Carvalho de Assis.
- STM32 F7: Add new configuration option for enabling flash ART

- STM32 F4 FLASH: Enable/disable the flash write protection on any
sector. I have verified it to work on the STM32 F427. From Sebastien
Lorquet.
- STM32 F4 Clocking: To use an external oscillator module (not just a
crystal) with the STM32F4, one needs to enable the HSEBYP bit in the
RCC_CR register. This change allows an integrator to define
STM32_RCC_CR_HSEBYP in their board.h file if they want this
configuration. From Jeff.
- STM32 F4 USB: I'm working on bringing up USB full-speed support on
STM32F405. My board does not include a USB power switch, VBus
sensing, over current detection, or ID pin. This commit add a
config STM32_OTGFS_VBUS_ CONTROL which lets us selectively disable
VBus sensing and control. I also sneaked in a change to disable the
configgpio call for the ID pin, which is only used in OTG mode which
isn't supported yet. The only pins that need to be initialized should
be OTGFS_DP and OTGFS_DM. From Jeff.
- STM32 FLASH: Add CONFIG_STM32_STM32F469 support. From David Sidrane.
- STM32 COMP: Add default INM configuration and some missing COMP
1,3,5,7 code. From Mateusz Szafoni.

- STM32 F7: Definitions for I2C4, SDMMC2. Adapted RAM start / size to
internal SRAM. From Titus von Boxberg.
- STM32 F7 I2C4: I2C4_SDA can also be on GPIO PB7. From Titus von
Boxberg.
- STM32 F7 LTDC: Option for DSI output, inconsistency: the stm32f746
does not feature a DSI interface. compilable with LTDC_INTERFACE and
LTDC_USE_DSI. From Titus von Boxberg.
- STM32 F7 Clocking: Added functions for DSI clock source selection.
From Titus von Boxberg.
- STM32 F7 Clocking: Enable APB2 DSI clock. From Titus von Boxberg.

dithering init. Corrected LIPOS/LIPCR calculation. Change only
polarity bits in LTDC_GCR. From Titus von Boxberg.
- STM32 F7 Reset: Added function for reset. From Titus von Boxberg.
- STM32 F7 DMA: DMA add dcache alignment check in stm32_dmacapable. In
the case dcache write-buffed mode is used (not write-through) buffer
alignment is required for DMA transfers because a)
arch_invalidate_dcache could lose buffered writes data and b)
arch_flush_dcache could corrupt adjacent memory if the maddr and the
mend+1, the next next address are not on ARMV7M_DCACHE_LINESIZE
boundaries. From David Sidrane.
- STM32 F7 SDMMC: SDMMC remove widebus limitation on DMA. There is no
documentation for the STM32F7 that limits DMA on 1 bit vrs 4 bit
mode. From David Sidrane.
- STM32 F7 SDMMC: SDMMC add dcache alignment check in
dma{recv|send}setup. In the case where CONFIG_SDIO_PREFLIGHT is not
used.

Boxberg.

* C Library/Header Files:

- Move TUN ioctl command to include/nuttx/net/ioctl.h so that it will
always be unique.
- Math Library: Port gamma() and lgamma() from FreeBSD to NuttX. From
Alan Carvalho de Assis.
- C++: Compilation with recent C++ compiler needs an overloaded delete
operator that includes a size_t size argument. New sized delete
operators are only for C++14 and above.

* Build/Configuration System:

- Initial clang compile. From Goran Mekic.
- Add CLANG definitions in Kconfig and Toolchain.defs.
- drivers/wireless/ieee802154: Moved radios to individual
sub-directories. From Anthony Merlino.
- Makefile.unix: Add savedefconfig target. From Gwenhael Goavec-Merou.
- Add Gwenhael's change to Makefile.win and update README.txt to
described the new make target.
- All defconfig files are now in the compressed format created with
'make savedefconfig.' The original .config file can be reconstituted
using 'make olddefconfig.'
- Build System: It is no longer necessary to have a unique Make.defs
file for each configuration. A board may share a common Make.defs
file in the scripts directory. Duplicate Make.defs files removed;
common Make.defs file moved to the scripts/ sub-directory for each
board.
- Networking: Move INET socket interface out of net/sockets to its own
directory net/inet.

* Tools:

- testbuild.sh: Added -x to fail build on errors for continuous
integration (CI). On CI we want to know ASAP of a failure. From
David Sidrane.
- Improve configure.sh behavior: (1) enable to call from top directory.
(2) enable to designate direct path for config. (3) install .gdbinit
if the target has. From Hidetaka Takano.
- Update tools/configure.c to same functionality as configure.sh. Add
an array of optional file names. Currently, .gdbinit is the only
optional file but other things like IDE-specific project files might
need to be copied as well.
- tools/configure.sh will now copy Eclipse project files if they are
present in the board directory file.
- Update configure.sh, configure.bat, configure.c: With compressed
format, part of the installation requires that we run 'make
olddefconfig' to restore the uncompressed defconfig format. Also,
while I was at it, I also added options to select host platform on
configure command line.
- tools/refresh.sh: Now runs make savedefconfig before copying the new
defconfig file in place; Also, added a new option --defaults. Since
the number of defaults that you now have to answer is so large, the
option lets you just accept the default values. So it works just like
--silent but still prompts you for the decision to save or discard the
new defconfig file.
- tools/refresh.sh: Update so that it can find the Make.defs file in
the new location.

* NSH: apps/nshlib:

- NSH Library: Add a Telnetd command. This is needed when network
initialization is deferred. In that case, telnet daemon cannot be
started until the network is finally initialized. The telnetd command
was added just for that case: So that the telnet daemon can be
started from the NSH command line after the network is configured.
- NSH Library: Misc changes needed for PktRadio support.
- NSH Library: Extend ifconfig command so that it can set variable
length packet radio address.
- NSH Library: Update addroute and delroute command. The would support either
IPv4 or IPv6, but not both. Allow expression of the netmask in IPv4 CIDR or
IPv6 slash notation. This really reduces the pain of using the commands,
especially for IPv6.
- NSH Library: Add a route command that will dump the content of routing table.

* Examples/Tests: apps/examples:

- examples/udp: Add configurable network device name; Add option to
suppress network initialization which is not needed if started by NSH
or for 6LoWPAN.
- examples/udp: Fix registration as a built-in program; Change some
naming to make room for a second target. Current one endpoint is the
target and one is the host. This will (eventually) allow two targets
to be both endpoints of the test. Change build so that both server
and client can be on a target, rather than one on the target one on
the host PC. Server IP address may not be provided on the command line.
- examples/udp: Port numbers need to be configurable to work with
6LoWPAN. Need to bind the client socket to a port number. This was
not required before so is a apparently a change in the UDP packet
dispatch logic.
- examples/udp: Enable testing with the broadcast address.
- examples/nettest: Support target boards on both ends of the test.
Separate out network initialization so that it may be used by both a
target server and a target client. Fix client/server naming
confusion; Add command line option to select the server address on the
target. Add support for both endpoints on target boards vs. one on a
target and one on the host PC.
- examples/nettest: The send buffer size is now a configuration option.
- examples/nettest: Loopback option should be available in Kconfig for
PktRadio.
- examples/keypadtest: REMOVED and warehoused in the Obsoleted
repository. This was just a bad clone of apps/examples/hidkbd for a
keypad driver that was removed years ago. It also uses illegal
function calls into the OS. So it has no purpose: It is redundant, it
uses illegal interfaces, and is a test for non-existent code.
- examples/ipforward: Add an IP forwarding example using only TUN
devices. Test extended to test forwarding of ICMPv6 multicast messages.
- Implement powermonitor example for ltc4151 current and voltage
monitor. From Giorgio Groß.
- examples/pf_ieee802154: Add for testing PF_IEEE802154 sockets. Add
PANID to command line options; Cannot bind to address zero... There is
no counterpart to INADDR_ANY for these radios (not now at least).
- examples/dac: Add DAC example. From Juha Niskanen.

* Network Utilities: apps/netutils:

- netutils/telnetc: This a port of libtelnet to NuttX.
- netutils/telnetd and users of telnetd: Add support for IPv6.
- netutils/thttpd: Remove the netstats demo. This depends on an
illegal function call and cannot be supported. That example could be
replaced with logic that uses the procfs network entries as was done
for NSH which had the same issue. But I am too lazy to implement that.
- netutils/netlib: Add support for PktRadio IOCTL commands.
- netutils/netlib: Add a helper to decode short addresses.

* Wireless Utilities: apps/wireless:

- wireless/ieee802154/i8sak: Rewrote i8sak to be test CLI for IEEE
802.15.4 MAC layer. From Anthony Merlino.
- wireless/ieee802154/i8sak: Updates to i8sak for
association/beacon-enabled changes to IEEE 802.15.4. From Anthony
Merlino.
- wireless/ieee802154/i8sak: Add option to make it easy to send large
frame for testing purposes. From Anthony Merlino.
- wireless/ieee802154/i8sak: Add scan command. From Anthony Merlino.
- wireless/ieee802154/i8sak: Add coordinfo command allowing you to
poll various attributes related to the coordinator. From Anthony
Merlino.
- wireless/ieee802154/i8sak: Add a option to retry on failures to the
assoc command (usually meaning tht the coordinator is not yet up).
- iwireless/ieee802154/8sak: Add reset command to reset the MAC layer.
Adds option to assoc command -t to specify how long to wait for a
response from the Coordinator. From Anthony Merlino.
- ieee802154/i8sak: Adds command to trigger regdump of radio. From
Anthony Merlino.

* System Utilities (apps/system)

- apps/system/composite: Update to apps/system/composite associated with
big changes to the composite device logic. From Frank Benkert.
- apps/system/composite: Remove CDC/ACM and MSC configuration logic.
This belongs in the OS composite initialization. Add and argument so
that you can select the USB composite configuration to be attached.
Restore USB tracing; remove unused field in a structure. Remove
configuration settings that are no longer used. Fix configuration
selecting.. was setting the port number, not the configure ID. Also
add a configuration option to select the default configuration.
- apps/system/composite: Add a configuration option to the boardctl()
calls to support multiple composite device configurations dynamically.
- apps/system/composite: Remove references to USBMSC. There still
dependencies on CDC/ACM in the serial USB trace output.
- apps/system/telnet: Add Telnet Chat daemon and client from
libtelent.

* Platform-Specific Support (apps/platform)

Bugfixes. Only the most critical bugfixes are listed here (see the
ChangeLog for the complete list of bugfixes and for additional, more
detailed bugfix information):

* Core OS:

- Fix ELF loader up_checkarch on ARM arch. From Cristian Condurache.
- pthread_mutex_unlock(): Missing check for the case where
pthread_mutex_lock() is called when the mutex is not locked. In that
case, it would increment the underlying semaphore above 1. This is
the fix for a problem noted by initialkjc@yahoo.com.
- sig_timedwait(): Pending signal structure used after it has been
releasd. From anonymous Bitbucket Issue 59.
- mm_mallinfo: do heap end debug assert check with heap semaphore held.
From Jussi Kivilinna.
- sched/: Fix return value in sched_setaffinity(). From Masayuki
Ishikawa.
- Work Queues: work_queue() must cancel existing work prior to queuing
new work, otherwise the work queue list structure can become
corrupted. Problem noted by Pascal Speck.
- waitpid(): Corrects two problems when CONFIG_SCHED_HAVE_PARENT +
CONFIG_SCHED_CHILD_STATUS are enabled: (1) Was erroring out if the
waited for task had already exited, and (2) was not freeing resources
when a wait was completed. From Boris Astardzhiev.

* File System/Block and MTD Drivers:

- VFS poll(): Fix timeout calculation. From Jim Paris.
- VFS poll(): Fix poll for regular files and block devices. Open Group
documentation says that poll (and select) support regular files and
that 'Regular files shall always poll TRUE for reading and writing'.
From Jussi Kivilinna.
- VFS epoll(): Fix epoll_wait function. From Simon Piriou.
- Smart FS: Fix wrong freeing of device structure and use-after-free
issues on error paths. From Jussi Kivilinna.
- MTD FLASH drivers: The byte write method of several drivers had a
cloned error: It was not locking the bus while performing byte write
operations.
- MTD M2PX: If we READ while a write/erase is pending, the command is
ignored and the write/erase continues. If we don't catch this situation
we will return garbage to the user because the flash will not execute
the command. So READ MUST wait for write completion, and before that,
the bus must be locked since it's a precondition to calling
waitwritecomplete(). From Sebastien Lorquet.
- MTD FLASH drivers: Clone Sebastien Lorquet's m25px change to at25,
is25xp, ramtron, and sst25xx.
- MTD W25: Add missing locking and fix SPI_SELECT usage for
w25_unprotect. From Jussi Kivilinna.
- MTD W25: Wait for BUSY flag to clear in w25_readid and
w25_unprotect. W25Q128 datasheet says that all instructions expect
'Read Status Register' and 'Erase/Program Suspend' are ignored when
BUSY flag in status register is '1'. Therefore wait for busy flag to
clear in w25_readid() and w25_unprotect(). From Jussi Kivilinna.
- Automounter: FS_AUTOMOUNTER should depend on SCHED_LPWORK. From
Nickolay Semyonov.

* Networking/Network Drivers:

- TCP Listen: Throw error when error happens in the tcp_listen
function. From Roland Takacs.
- Network Device Management: Do not search net device when all-zeros
address is used. From Roland Takacs.
- Network Device Management: Fix a error in netdev_register(); it was
not handling device names properly when TUN is the only network device.
- Network Device Management: Fix netdev_dev_lladdrsize(). In some
configurations, it could return the wrong size for the address of a
packet radio.
- Network Device Management: Fix typo for 802.11 devices in
netdev_register(). Was being masked before because depended on
CONFIG_NET_MULTLINK.
- TUN Driver: Use critical section instead of semaphore in
tun_ifdown(). From Masayuki Ishikawa.
- TUN Driver: Do all polling on worker thread. Otherwise, the stack
gets very deep.
- TUN Driver: Currently cannot support TAP mode unless Ethenet is
enabled.
- netdb: Fixed buffer size used for sending DNS queries should depend
on the configured DNS name size. From Ritjaina.
- UDP networking: The TTL (time to live) was not being set in the IPv4
or IPv6 header unless the UDP socket was bound.
- UDP Networking: Fix a copy-paste error that could effect networking
when both IPv4 and IPv6 are enabled.
- UDP Networking: When upd_input() cannot process a packet, it returns
ERROR so that network drivers may try calling ipv4_input() later. In
this case, it must also set d_len to zero. Otherwise, all network
drivers will assume tht there is also an outgoing packet. This
results in a gratuitous ARP.
- TCP Networking: Correct some issues that prevent TCP from working
correctly when both IPv4 and IPv6 are enabled.
- TCP Networking: TCP disconnection callbacks are not retained in a
list. This will support multiple callbacks per lower-level TCP
connection structure. That is necessary for the cae where a socket is
dup'ed and shares the same lower-level connection structure. NOTE:
There still needs to be a call to tcp_start_monitor() when the socket
is dup'ed.
- TCP Networking: Start the network monitor for a socket when a TCP
socket is dup'ed.
- TCP Networking: If one of the dup'ed socket's is closed, then network
monitor resources associated with that one socket must be recovered.
Also, in the event that socket is being used on one thread, but then
closed on another, any threads waiting for events from the socket
should be informed of the closure. That latter requirement is not
implemented because current data structures do not support it.
- TCP Networking: Fix a race condition. The accept() operation is
performed with the network locked. However, the network is unlocked
BEFORE the connected state is set. Therefore, a context switch may
occur and the socket may no longer be connected when it is marked so.
Noted by Pascal Speck.
- Network routing tables: Fix a compilation error when IPv6 and
routing are enabled.
- Network procfs: Fix some spacing when both IPv6 and IPv4 are enabled.
- Network Local Sockets: Fix accept for local stream sockets. From
Jussi Kivilinna.
- Network Local Sockets: Fix server lc_waitsem overflow. From Jussi
Kivilinna.
- IPv6 Networking: Remove comparisons to the address with all ones
set. IPv6 does not support broadcast addresses and certainly not in
that form. Replace with multicast addresses beginning with 0xff02.
- ICMPv6 Networking: Fix a compilation issue with
CONFIG_NET_ICMPv6_AUTOCONF=y. From Masayuki Ishikawa.
- Networking: Fix net_lock returning ERROR when instead of real error
code on failure. From Jussi Kivilinna.
- IGMPv2 Networking: Remove special support for interrupt level
processing (there is none) and fix some timer cancellation logic. In
many files, correct comments. There is no interrupt level processing
in the networking layer.

* Wireless/Wireless Drivers:

- IEEE 802.15.4 MAC: Need counting protection on the logic that
releases the notification resources. Otherwise, notification handlers
may be operating with a stale pointer.
- IEEE 802.15.4 MAC: Improves internal timer logic to handle work
serially. Before, the MAC timer used a watchdog to schedule work with
the high priority worker queue. However, since everything in the MAC
is supposed to be serialized through the use of the high priority work
queue, but the timer uses a watchdog, there are some unintended
consequences. To simplify, we now use the delayed work feature of the
work queue. From Anthony Merlino.
- IEEE 802.15.4 Network Driver: Update RX statistics in network driver.
- IEEE 802.15.4 MRF24J40 Driver: Minor timing fix. Matches recommended
value in datasheet. Splits up driver into multiple files to make it
easier to navigate. Fixes issue with non-beacon enabled mode. From
Anthony Merlino.
- IEEE 802.15.4 MRF24J40 Driver: Fix a bug causing radio to cease
transmitting. From Anthony Merlino.
- IEEE 802.15.4 MRF24J40 Driver: Fixes issues with sleeping for beacon
enabled networking. From Anthony Merlino.
- EEE 802.15.4 MRF24J40 Driver: Fix math error for calculating sleep
count values. From Anthony Merlino.
- IEEE 802.15.4: Fix timing issues for beacon enabled coordinators and
endpoints. From Anthony Merlino.
- iIEEE 802.15.4: Fix issue with association on beacon-enabled
networking. From Anthony Merlino.
- 6LoWPAN: Correct a few addressing issues. Also reserve two bytes at
the end of the frame for the FCS.
- 6LoWPAN: Fixes needed when extended addressing is enabled; broke short
addressing. Loopback driver needs to initialize the MAC meta data;
Address decompression logic must have the MAC address to handle the
most common compression cases. Fix a src/dest address confusion and
other addressing problems.
- 6LoWPAN: Add missing IPv6 address creation to HC1 decode logic. Fix a
typo in an index that prevented use with HC1 and extended addresses.
- 6LoWPAN: TCP logic was not obeying MTU packet size limitations.
- 6LoWPAN: Major re-architecting of TCP logic to properly handle TCP
stuff like ACKs and TDP windowing which were not properly covered in
the initial design.
- 6LoWPAN: HC06, copy TCP header as though it were data. TCP packet
reassembly now seems to work OK.
- 6LoWPAN: Fix duplicate and bad memcpy in loopback driver.
- 6LoWPAN: Fix a misconception about HC06 16-bit IPv6 address
compression.
- 6LoWPAN: TCP send logic was returning a failure in one case when, in
fact, the send was successful.

* Common Drivers:

- USB MSC: Use struct instead of pointer to the struct as sizeof
argument in memset in usbmsc.c. Otherwise it leads to error: argument
to sizeof in memset call is the same pointer type struct usbmsc_lun_s
* as the destination. From Oleg Evseev.
- USB MSC: Add missing logic to define endpoints. The composite
changes broke the the non-composite, USB MSC only case because it omitted the critical setup when USB MSC was not part of the composite.
- USB CDC/ACM. Fix several known problems resulting from merge of USB
composite device. That merge now breaks some of the non-composite USB
devices.
- Button Driver: Interrupts weren't enabled since nothing updates them
after btn_poll() marks the file descriptor structure as being polling.
From Jan Pobrislo.
- ADC Driver: Fix some data alignment issues in the ADC driver.
- I2C Drivers: Handle I2C_TRANSFER return value consistently. Some I2C
peripherals transfers return zero on success, others number of
completed transfers. Make drivers robust against this. From Juha
Niskanen.
- COMP Driver: Fix compilation errors when poll disabled. From Mateusz
Szafoni.

* Simulation:

- Simulation: Fix mkdir issue in GNU target. From Simon Piriou.
- Simulation: x86 stack needs to be aligned to 16-byte boundaries.
- Simulation: Fix building 32-bit simulation on 32-bit X86. From Jussi
Kivilinna.

* ARM:

- ARM: The older ARM7 and ARM9 configurations were determining CFLAGS
based on the GCC version 4.x.x or not. That needx to be extended for
5.x.x and 6.x.x which also behave like 4.x.x.

* ARMv7-M:

- Fixed ARMv7-M Toolchain setting. Cortex-M4 only have Single
Precision FPU. From Hidetaka Takano.
- ARMv7-M syscall logic: Clear bit 0 in PC settings. Bit 0 is the
thumb mode indication and should not be set in the PC. This extra bit
has not caused problems in the past, but seeing it set in the PC is
unnerving.

* Espressif ESP32:

- Fix ESP32 gpio enable reg and default UART pin. Modify default UART
pin for ESP-WROOM-32. Fix gpio enable reg. From Sungki Kim.

* Microchip/Atmel SAMD21 Drivers:

- SAMD21: Fix some SPI-related issues. From Matt Thompson.
- SAMD21 SPI: I was having issues with the bus freezing up .. slaves
holding SDL low.. so I rewrote a good portion of the interrupt logic
based on the application notes from Atmel. One major improvement is
using the RXNACK flag in the STATUS register, which indicates that no
device responded to an address packet. Assuming that the chip will
always give an interrupt status, I believe it's possible to eliminate
the timer as well. From Matt Thompson.
- SAMD/L21: Need to preserve errno value across syslog() call.
- SAMD21: Changes needed to get USB working. From Matt Thompson.

* Microchip/Atmel SAMv7 Drivers:

- SAMv7 TWIHS: TWIHS driver add reference counting. From David Sidrane.
- SAMv7 CAN: We discovered a problem with the samv7 mcan driver which
results, under some circumstances, in a very high CPU load. The
problem occurs, and is easily reproducible, if the device is connected
to a CAN network with a wrongly configured CAN speed (baud rate). In
our tests we set the CAN speed of the device to 1000000 and the speed
of the other CAN nodes to 500000. The device is restarted and sends a
CANopen "bootup message" to the CAN network. This results in huge
amount of errors messages on the CAN bus, probably because of the CAN
feature for acknowledging error messages. The error messages can't be
read by the device because of the misconfigured CAN speed, instead the
CAN chip reports lots of errors, which are reported to the application
which uses the CAN driver (CONFIG_CAN_ERRORS is enabled). The CAN
errors are reported from the CAN chip via interrupts and thus the
interrupt load is very high in this scenario. To fix the problem the
driver now disables each RX error interrupt after it is occurred. The
RX error interrupts are turned back on if at least one CAN message is
received successfully. From Stefan Kolb.
- SAMv7 CAN: I discovered while working on the SAMV7 mcan driver that
the implementation of the CAN error handling is suboptimal. In the
current implementation the many errors are implemented as pending
errors. But those errors are not pending, the errors occurred and are
gone directly afterwards. This commit changes the described behavior
and simplifies the handling of CAN errors. From Stefan Kolb.

* Microchip/Atmel SAMv7 Boards:

- SAMv71-XULT: Fix MRF24J40 interrupt GPIO number.

* NXP/Freescale Kinetis:

- Kinetis MPU: Disable MPU when not in protected mode. The hardware
reset state of the the MPU precludes any bus masters other than DMA
access to memory. Unfortunately USB and SDHC have their own DMA and
will not have access to memory in the default reset state. This change
disabled the MPU if present on system startup. From David Sidrane.
- Kinetis MPU: Fixed warning for kinetis_mpudisable. Missing header
file added. From David Sidrane.
- Kinetis SIM: Ensure isolation of clock dividers for 0 value case.
This fixes a bug were a SoC does not have a clockdivN register and
passes a 0 for the init value. This prevents overflow of the 0
decremented to -1 (0xffffffff) spilling over to other clockdivN
fields. From David Sidrane.

* NXP/Freescale i.MX6 Drivers:

- i.MX6: Fix a wrong parameter passed when calling irq_attach() in
imx_serial.c. From Masayuki Ishikawa.
- Based on Masayuki's change, I review all serial driver vector
attachment. I Found one additional error and updated all relevant
drivers to current interrupt parameter passing.

* STMicro STM32:

- STM32 F410 Kconfig: Fix peripherals available on the STM32 F410.
This also adds a select for STM32_HAVE_DAC1 present on this STM32
flavor. From Gwenhael Goavec-Merou.
- STM32 L4 DMA: Correct USART3_RX bad channel definition. From Juha
Niskanen.
- STM32 L4 PWR: Correct PWR_SR2 REGLPS and REGLPF bits, add port I
registers. Also remove duplicate section from Kconfig. From Juha
Niskanen.
- STM32 F7: do not enable read-modify-write on DTCM. "AN 4667 - STM32F7
Series system architecture and performance" recommends to disable
read-modify-write on DTCM: "If the DTCM-RAM is used as data location
and the variables used are byte or/and halfword types, since there is
no ECC management in this RAM on the STM32F7 Series, it is recommended
to disable the read-modify-write of the DTCM-RAM in the DTCM interface
(in the DTCMCR register) to increase the performance." From Jussi
Kivilinna.

* STMicro STM32 Drivers:

- STM32 TIM3/4 are always 16-bits; never 32-bits. Noted by Eetu
Nevalainen..
- STM32 ADC: Invalidate dma buffer before use. Missing invalidation
caused old samples being fetched from cache. From Jussi Kivilinna.
- STM32, STM32L4, STM32F7 ADC: Fix channel 18 sample time. From Juha
Niskanen.
- STM32 DAC: Fix some configuration logic. When STM32_NDAC is greater
than 1, then second channel is always DAC1OUT2. From Mateusz Szafoni.
- STM32 DAC: Fix compilation when DMA disabled for channel. From
Mateusz Szafoni.
- STM32 F0: Fix some funny shifts in DAC header files. From Juha
Niskanen.
- STM32 F1 RTC fixes: (1) Compile issues because of missing RTC_MAGIC
#defines, (2) missing functionality based on RTC_MAGIC in RTC based on
stm32_rtcounter.c, (3) IRQ setup from up_rtc_initialize was later
reset in up_irqinitialize, (4) write access to backup registers
without enabling access to backup domain, (5) possible races in
set/cancel alarm. tested with STM32F103C8 only. device now wakes up
from forced STANDBY mode by alarm. From Leif Jakob.
- STM32/STM32 L4 PWM: While attempting to output a 70 MHz square wave
from the timer output of a STM32 clocked at 140 MHz, found that the
reload calculation was off by one. This correction does allow the
output up to 70 MHz. I am not sure this affects most users
generating slow PWM but for frequencies close to the PCLK, the
difference becomes significant. From JM.
- STM32 L4 I2C: Set I2C SDA and SCL pins to open drain mode. From Pekka
Ervasti.
- STM32 L4 I2C: I2C4 was writing to wrong RCC registers. From Juha
Niskanen.
- STM32 L4 DAC: Report transfer as completed in DMA callback. Without
this even O_NONBLOCK writes block the calling task if DAC was using
DMA. From Juha Niskanen.
- STM32 L4 COMP: comparators share RCC enable bit with SYSCFG. From
Juha Niskanen.
- STM32 L4 ADC: Correct EXTSEL macros. From Juha Niskanen.
- STM32 L4 TIM: TIM15,16,17 are always in APB2. From Juha Niskanen.
- STM32 F7 I2C: Set I2C4 SDA and SCL pins to open drain mode. From Juha
Niskanen.
- STM32 F4 RTCC: ISR register and write protection fix. From Eetu
Nevalainen.
- STM32 F7 Ethernet: Fix typo in header; Add memory sync barrier
between writing to DMA TX descriptor and restarting DMA TX. Avoid
calling work_queue on pollwork if it's already queued, just skip a
poll cycle instead. Nucleo-144: Fix RMII TXD1 signal, connected to
PB13 not to PG14. From savinz.
- STM32 F7: Added missing config option for register value debugging.
From Titus von Boxberg.
- STM32 F7: No FSMC, only FMC for STM32F7. From Titus von Boxberg.
- STM32 F7: HEAP2 depends on CONFIG_ARCH_HAVE_HEAP2, not on particular
FMC RAM type. From Titus von Boxberg.
- STM32 F7: STM32_RCC_DCKCFGR2 has nothing to do with PLLI2S; PLLI2S is
not dependent on LTDC, instead on SAICLK1/2 generated from PLLI2S.
From Titus von Boxberg.
- STM32F7: Some STM32F7 builds failed in build testing due to undefined
STM32_SRAM1_BASE. I think that is because stm32_allocateheap.c was
not including chip/stm32_memorymap.h.
- STM32 F7: dcache write-buffed mode is used (not write-through) buffer
alignment is required for DMA transfers because a)
arch_invalidate_dcache could lose buffered writes data and b)
arch_flush_dcache could corrupt adjacent memory if the buffer and the
bufflen, are not on ARMV7M_DCACHE_LINESIZE boundaries. From David
Sidrane.

* STMicro STM32 Boards:

- STM32F103-Minumum SPI: SPIDEV_WIRELESS used when this has
changed to SPIDEV_CONTACTLESS. From Nicolas Estibals.
- configs/: a few more places where SPIDEV_WIRELELSS should be
SPIDEV_CONTACTLESS.
- STM32F103-Minumum: Fix a BUG when reading from output pin. We need
a different read_ops to read from output pin. This patch fixes the
issue. From Alan Carvalho de Assis.
- STM32F103-Minumum: Use separated read_ops for GPIO interrupt pins.
From Alan Carvalho de Assis.
- STM32F103-Minumum: Fix compiler error in MCP2415 logic.
- STM32F746G-DISCO: Fix for compilation of STM32F746G-DISCO. From Ivan
Ucherdzhiev.
- STM32F746G-DISCO: Fix for stm32f746g-disco board for button support
with interrupt. This change is tested with buttons app example and it
is working with interrupts (signals). I tried the test with polling
but at this point it doesn't work. From Ivan Ucherdzhiev.

* Build System

- Fix -Werror=implicit-fallthrough on gcc7. From Julien Lecoeur.
- configs/Board.mk: Remove comment form end of line. In windows native
build, it appears to be trying to make that an extra parameter to the
AR command. From Jeff.
- configs/Board.mk: Remove quotes from CONFIG_ARCH_FAMILY. Causes
problems with Windows native build. From Jeff.
- Makefile.win would only create uboot images for ARM. MIPS support
also needed. From Lwazi Dube.

* C Library/Header Files:

- C++: Fix C++ __guard implementation for ARM. The standard C++ ABI
that most platforms follow defines __guard to be 64 bits. The existing
implementation of libxx_cxa_guard.cxx follows this. However, the
32-bit ARM C++ ABI defines it as 32 bits instead, and changes the
meaning slightly so only the lowest bit is used. This matters because
GCC creates guard symbols without regards to what libxx_cxa_guard.cxx
says. So on ARM, gcc allocates 4 bytes, but __cxa_guard_release
writes 8 bytes, zeroing out another unlucky variable nearby. Fix it
by special-casing 32-bit ARM in libxx_cxa_guard. From Jim Paris.
- C++: In cwchar it uses CONFIG_LIBC_WCHAR to only export the wc/mb
functions. When a build does not want to use wide or multibyte char
CONFIG_LIBC_WCHAR is not set. Therefore we should to only export the
wc/mb functions when defined. Regardless of the stat of
CONFIG_LIBC_WCHAR the non mb/wc definitions such as mbstate_t,
wint_t, wctype_t need to be exported. From David Sidrane.
- C Library: Fix an error in mkstemp() the could result in an infinite
loop. From Alan Carvalho de Assis.
- C Library: (1) Fix an error in mkstemp() the could result in an
infinite loop. (2) Fix for wrong output in some cases. For Example:
(a) input: "FILEXX", output: "FILE00" and repeats same output for
further invocations of mkstemp(). But, the output has to be FILE01,
FILE02, ...., FILEZZ. (b) input: "FILEXXXXXX", output: "FILE100000",
for next invocation "FILE200000" and so on. But it's good, if the
output goes like FILE000001, FILE000002, ..., FILE000101, ... From
Lokesh B V.
- C Library: gethostbyname_r: Fix check for space in buffer.
- C Library: inet_ntop() was printing negative values for fields >127.
- Math Library: Fix wrong output in modf() API. The sign of integral
part given by the modf() should be same as sign of input. But for
inputs between 0 and 1, the sign of integral part was not same as
sign of input. From Lokesh B V.
- Math Library: Fix wrong output in ceil() API. Ex:for input x = 1.0,
the output should be 1.0, but the output was 2.0. From Lokesh B V.

* Tools

- tools/testbuild.sh: Fix missing $ before variable name.
- tools/mkdeps.c: Eliminate a warning. MAX_PATH may already be defined
in included system files. From Jeff.

* Applications: apps/

- All apps/ Makefiles: Add .PRECIOUS: apps/libapps.a to every
Makefile. Hopefully this will end awkward problems when you Control-C
out of a build and libapps.a is deleted.
- platform/Makefile: More attempts to fix for Windows native build.
Backslash as a delimiter causes problems in pattern subsitutions.

* NSH: apps/nshlib:

- NSH network initialization: Fix some ieee 802.15.4 initialization
logic. It should not set the saddr or panid; those cannot be
hard-coded but must come from the coordinator. Re-factor a function
that has gotten too big and too complex. Do not set the IP address
for 6loWPAN. The 6loWPAN stack uses IP address that derive from the
ieee 802.15.4 addressing and cannot be (safely) configured by the user.
- NSH Library: Fix copy-paste typo in nsh_usbconsole.c. From Oleg
Evseev.
- NSH Library: fix size of 6LoWPAN extended address.
- NSH Library: Fix build break in nsh_command.c with IPv4/IPv6 dual
stack. From Masayuki Ishikawa.

libapps.a. Fix naming of a configuration setting.
- examples/nettest: Renaming some files to prevent name collision in
libapps.a
- examples/nximage: Remove unused global variable.
- examples/nsh: Remove APPNAME, PRIORITY, and STACKSIZE settings from
Makefile to avoid showing nsh in Builtin Apps. From Masayuki Ishikawa.

* Network Utilities: apps/netutils:

- netutils/tftpc: Missing header file causes errors in some
configurations.
- netutils/tftpc: TFTPC depends on CONFIG_NET_IPv4.
- netutils/netlib: Fixes to work when only USRSOCK is enabled.
- netutils/netlib: Fix netlib_nodaddrconv() so that its return type is
the same as other address conversion functions.
- netutils/netlib: If only PF_IEEE802154 socket family is enabled, then
must use SOCK_DGRAM.
- netutils/ftpc: Fix some memory leaks. From Boris Astardzhiev.
- netutils/thttpd: Fix a malformed if condition detected by GCC 6.x.x.
- netutils/dhcpd: Prevent buffer overflow in dhcpd_addoption. offset
represents distance from start of option buffer. So this should be
changed current option pointer minus start of buffer. From EunBong
Song.

* Wireless Utilities: apps/wireless:

- wireless/ieee802154/i8sak: Need to increment the next_saddr after
each successful association.

* System Utilities (apps/system)

- correct copy-paste typo in comments in composite_main.c From Oleg
Evseev.
- system/dhcpc: The DHCPC renew command did not build correctly due to
naming problems. Noted by Masayuki Ishikawa.
- system/dhcpc: Fix warning about renew_main.o appear twice in rule.

* Tools (apps/tools):

- tools/mkkconfig.bat: Use %cd% instead of %~dp0 for usage of APPSDIR
in this batch file.
- tools/mkkconfig.bat: Remove quotes in echo. These were begin
Echo'ed and generating double quots in the output. From Jeff.
- Windows build fixes: tools/mkkconfig.bat - switch APPSDIR path to
use forward slashes for kconfig-frontends. interpreters/ficl -
Reorder some targets that causes GNUwin32 make to behave badly. From
Jeff.
