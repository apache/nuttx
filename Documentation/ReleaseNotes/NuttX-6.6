NuttX-6.6
---------

The 73rd release of NuttX, Version 6.6, was made on July 11, 2011
and is available for download from the SourceForge website. The
6.6 release adds several smaller features but is mostly a bugfix
release.

Bugfixes include

* Fixed several NX Graphics bugs: Rendering fonts at >8 bits-per-pixel,
graphics move logic, and display artifacts that appear when a
window is closed.
* Corrections to the USB host mass storage class driver
* STM32 bugfixes: serial driver, GPIO interrupt handling
* LPC17xx: Changes for a success compilation with no console.
* Corrections to the Teensy AT90USB SD driver
* Changes for a clean compilation under the ZDS-II toolchain.

Minor features:

* Add logic to extract printf strings from FLASH (but there are
still printf issues for that target)
* Added a configuration for the Sure Electronics PIC32MX board.
However, higher priority tasks have stopped work on that
configuration.
* Added several new configurations for the STMicro STM3210E-EVAL
board.
* Added support for the STM3210E-EVAL board: (1) LCD in either
landscape or portrait mode, and (2) interrupting buttons.
* Added a configuration option to use different serial ports for
debug and for the NSH serial console (there are some issues
with CR-LF expansion and character echo if NSH is not run on
the console).
* Standardized the button press and button interrupt interfaces
so that they are common across all boards.
* Added a new graphics example that focuses on placing text on
the background while pop-up windows occur. Text should continue
to update normally with or without the popup windows present.
* Added ARM stack checking logic.

See the ChangeLog for a detailed description of these changes.
