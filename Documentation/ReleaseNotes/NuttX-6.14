NuttX-6.14
----------

The 81st release of NuttX, Version 6.14, was made on January 15, 2012,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website. Note
that release consists of two tarballs: nuttx-6.14.tar.gz and
apps-6.14.tar.gz. Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

This release corresponds with SVN release number: r4301

New features in this release include:

* Drivers. The upper-half PWM driver will now support a pulse count (as
would be needed to control a stepper motor).

* STM32. The CAN driver has been verified in loopback mode. ADC driver
support for the STM32 F4. Add support for UART4-5 and USART6
(Contributed by Mike Smith). The PWM driver now supports a pulse
count for TIM1 and TIM8. Timer driver now supports the F4's 32-bit
timers (Contributed by Mikhail Bychek)

* STM32F4Discovery. Support for the STM32F4-Discovery board contributed
by Mike Smith.

* STM3240G-EVAL. Add support for user control of LEDs.

* LPC17xx. Add support for loopback mode to CAN driver. CAN TX done
perations are now interrupt driver. Now supports configurable CAN bit
rate.

* LPC1766-STK. Add support for on-board buttons. Add support for user
control of LEDs.

* LM3S. Add support for the LM3S6432S2E on the TI RDK-S2E (Contributed
by Mike Smith)

* PIC32MX. USB device-side driver (needs further testing). A partial
Ethernet driver is also in place.

* Library. Support added for fixed floating point fieldwidths in output
formatting (Contributed by Mikhail Bychek)

* Build. New targets apps_clean and apps_distclean to simplify working
with application directories.

Bugfixes include:

* Drivers. Fixed a buffer-full test in the upper-half CAN driver.

* STM32. GPIO initialize logic (submitted by Mike Smith). Fix the
debug logic that dumps the GPIO configuration.

* LPC17xxx. Correct an integer overflow in GPIO interrupt setup
(prevented pins > 15 from being used as interrupt sources). Correct
a value used in GPIO interrupt number range test.

* FAT. Now returns the correct error value when it is unable to
recognize the file system.

* Build. macOS build fixes (submitted by Mike Smith)

And several others. See the ChangeLog for more details.
