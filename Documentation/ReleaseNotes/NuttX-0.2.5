NuttX-0.2.5
------------

This is the 8th release of NuttX. This release includes:

(1) Several bug fixes
(2) Initial support for FAT filesystems. Testing has not
been exhaustive and some functionality is missing
(mkdir, stat, unlink chmod, and rename functionality is
not yet implemented).
(3) Support for the NXP lpc2148 processor is included but
is untested as of this writing. The current
implementation includes only support for serial console
and timer interrupt.

See the ChangeLog for a complete list of changes.

This release has been verified only on the Linux user-mode
platform.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from May 19,
2007.
