NuttX-0.3.11
------------

This is the 23rd release of NuttX. This is another important bugfix
release. This releases fixes several bugs:

* Two POSIX timer bugs: a memory leak as well a fatal sequencing error.
* Several FAT filesystem errors.
* A deadlock that can occur in opendir()

A few new features were also added:

* Support for recursive mutexes
* Added a RAM disk block driver
* The host simulator no longer uses direct Linux system calls and
now also works on Cygwin.
* The OS test was strengthen and now runs as an endurance test

These changes were verified only on the Host simulator under Cygwin.
Please report any errors to me.
