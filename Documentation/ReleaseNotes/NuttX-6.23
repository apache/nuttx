NuttX-6.23
----------

The 90th release of NuttX, Version 6.23, was made on November 5, 2012,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website. Note
that release consists of two tarballs: nuttx-6.23.tar.gz and
apps-6.23.tar.gz. Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

This release corresponds with SVN release number: r5313

Note that all SVN information has been stripped from the tarballs. If you
need the SVN configuration, you should check out directly from SVN. Revision
r5313 should equivalent to release 6.23 of NuttX 6.23:

svn checkout -r5313 svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/nuttx/code/trunk nuttx-code

Or

svn checkout -r5313 http://svn.code.sf.net/p/nuttx/code/trunk nuttx-code

Additional new features and extended functionality:

* RTOS: If both atexit() and on_exit() are enabled, use on_exit() to
implement atexit(). Updates for RGMP 4.0.

a file system.

* Drivers: Maxim MAX11802 touchscreen controller (Petteri Aimonen)

* STM32 Driver: Implementation of /dev/random using the STM32 Random Number
Generator (RNG).

* STM32 Boards: ADC support for the Shenzhou IV board. Relay support for
the Shenzhou IV board.

* C Library: Support is now included for the add-on uClibc++ C++
standard library support. This includes support for iostreams, strings,
STL, RTTI, exceptions -- the complete C++ environment. (uClibc++ is
provided as a separate add-on package due to licensing issues).
