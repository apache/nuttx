NuttX-0.3.4
-----------

This is the 16th release of NuttX and the 5th release containing
the integration of a network subsystem and the uIP TCP/IP, UDP, and
ICMP stacks into NuttX (see http://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/index.php/Main_Page).

This release is primarily a bug-fix release. New features include
only:

o TELNET front-end to NSH,
o DHCPC server functionality, and
o C5471 Ethernet driver.

Numerous network related problems were fixed related to DHCPC, UDP
input processing, UDP broadcast, send timeouts, and bad compilation when
uIP is compiled at high levels of optimization.

The level of network reliability is at a strong beta release level. The
baseline functionality of NuttX continues to mature and remains at
post-beta or production level.

Parts of this release were verified only on the Neuros OSD (DM320 ARM9)
platform using the DM90x0 Ethernet driver and other parts on the Spectrum
Digital C5471 EVM using the C5471 Ethernet driver. Any feedback about bugs
or suggestions for improving the network reliability/performance would be
greatly appreciated.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from December 10, 2007.
