NuttX-0.4.6
-----------

This is the 38th release of NuttX. The release features support
for the Micromint Eagle-100 development board. This board is based
around, the Luminary LM3S6918 MCU. This is the first ARM Cortex-M3
architecture supported by NuttX. This initial, basic port includes
timer and serial console with configurations to execute the NuttX
OS test and to run the NuttShell (NSH). Work is still underway on
this port and current plans are to have I2C, SSI, MMC/SD, and
Ethernet driver in the 0.4.7 release.

Additional work was done on the MXADS i.MX1 port, however, that
work has been set aside until I complete work on the Eagle-100 (I
also need to come up with a 3V power supply).

Other changes in this release include: Extensions to the SPI interface
definition in order to handle 9-bit interfaces to displays. Several
bugs were fixed (see the ChangeLog for a complete list of changes).

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from May 19, 2009.
