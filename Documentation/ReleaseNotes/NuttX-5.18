NuttX-5.18
----------

The 65th release of NuttX, Version 5.18, was made on February 27,
2011 and is available for download from the SourceForge website.
This is first release from the new NuttX SVN repository. This
release is made primarily to keep the release tarball in synchronization
with SVN. Many smaller changes have been made as identified in the
ChangeLog. Headlines include:

* Incorporate several important uIP patches -- including the well
known patch to handle missing SYNACK.
* The Freescale mc8s12ne64 port is code complete but testing has
not yet begun due to toolchain issues. Added support for the
Future Electronics Group NE64 Badge board.
* Added support for a new STM32 board, the ISOTEL NetClamps VSN
V1.2 ready2go sensor network platform. This board is based on
a STM32F103RET6 and includes some interesting power saving/clock
control extensions.
* USB host support expanded to handle vendor specific USB devices.
* Incorporated the LUFA HID parser.
* Various bugfix as detailed in the ChangeLog
