NuttX-5.12
----------

This is the 59th release of NuttX. This is a critical bugfix release.

* Fixed an important error in the signal trampoline logic.
Essentially, interrupts are re-enabled while the signal handler
executes, but the logic to re-disable the interrupts before
returning from the signal handler trampoline was missing. Under
certain circumstances, this can cause stack corruption. This
was discovered by David Hewson on an ARM9 platform, but since
the code has been leveraged, the bug has been propagated from
ARM to Cortex-M3, AVR32, M16C, SH1, ZNEO, eZ80, Z8, and Z80 --
almost every architecture. The correction has been incorporated
for all architectures but only verified on a few.

Other notable changes in NuttX-5.12:

* A complete port for the AVR32 (AT32UC3B0256) is incorporated
in the source tree. Testing of this port is underway now. This
release was made before verifying this port in order to get the
important bugfix in place.

* Other miscellaneous bugfix and enhancements as noted in the
ChangeLog.
