NuttX-0.4.13
------------

This is the 45th release of NuttX. The release extends the support
for the STMicro STM32 microcontroller. Minimal support for the
STM3210E-EVAL development board based around the STM32F103ZET6 MCU
was released in NuttX-0.4.12. This release adds:

* A simple interface definition to support some FLASH, EEPROM,
NVRAM, etc. devices.
* Verified SPI operation using driver for SPI based FLASH parts
M25P64 and M25P128.
* Improved Cortex-M3 context switching. This should improve
context switching performance be 2x in certain cases.
* Added a USB device-side driver for the STM32. This is an early
release of a very complex driver; some bugs are expected.
* The USB driver has been verified against the USB serial device
class driver. There is at least one known outstanding issue
(see the full bug description in the TODO list).

This release also corrects some important bugs in the early STM32 release:

* Fixed several errors the prevented operation of NuttX on an
STM32 development board using USART2 as the serial console.
* Fixed and optimization-dependent race condition in the clock
initialization.
* Fixed a critical bug in the interrupt control logic that could
cause interrupt operations to failed used for interrupts in a
certain range.
