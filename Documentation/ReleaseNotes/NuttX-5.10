NuttX-5.10
----------

This is the 57th release of NuttX. This release includes a combination
of some new features as well as several bugfixes. New features
include:

* TI/Luminary Stellaris LM3S9B96:
Header file changes contributed by Tiago Maluta.
* TI/Luminary Stellaris LM3S8962:
Header file changes and support for the Stellaris LM3S8962
Ethernet+CAN Evaluation Board contributed by Larry Arnold.
* On-Demand Paging Support:
The basic logic for the On-Demand Paging feature is complete,
implemented for the NXP LPC3131, and partially tested. See
https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/components/paging.html.
Some additional test infrastructure will be needed in order to complete
the verification. See configs/ea3131/README.txt for details.
* Two Pass Build Support:
The make system now supports a two pass build where a relocatable,
partially linked object is created on the first pass and that
object is linked with the NuttX libraries to produce the final
executable on the second pass. This two pass build is currently
only used to support the On-Demand paging feature: The first
pass link forces critical logic into the locked text region;
the second pass builds the NuttX executable more-or-less as
normal.
* CONFIG_APP_DIR:
Generalized the way in which applications are built and linked
with NuttX. The new configuration CONFIG_APP_DIR replaces
CONFIG_EXAMPLE. CONFIG_EXAMPLE used to identify the sub-directory
within the NuttX examples/ directory that held the example
application to be built. That made it awkward to configure to
build an application that resides outside of the NuttX examples/
directory. CONFIG_APP_DIR is more general; it can be used to
refer to any directory containing the application to be built.

For people who have their own configurations and/or Makefiles,
you will need to make a couple of changes:

- Replace all occurrences of CONFIG_EXAMPLE=foobar with
CONFIG_APP_DIR=examples/foobar in all of the configuration
files.
- Replace any occurrences of examples/$(CONFIG_EXAMPLE) with
$(CONFIG_APP_DIR)
- Replace any occurrences of lib$(CONFIG_EXAMPLE)$(LIBEXT)
with libapp$(LIBEXT) in your Makefiles.
- Check any other occurrences of CONFIG_EXAMPLE.

* Several bugfixes are included as well as code changes to eliminate
some warnings. See the ChangeLog for details.
