NuttX-6.13
----------

The 80th release of NuttX, Version 6.13, was made on December 26, 2011
and is available for download from the SourceForge website. Note
that release consists of two tarballs: nuttx-6.13.tar.gz and
apps-6.13.tar.gz. Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

This release corresponds with SVN release number: r4231

New features in this release include:

* Drivers. New standard interface for PWM drivers and common
"upper half" PWM driver. Updated the MP25x driver to support
the Macronix MX25 chips (submitted by Mohammad Elwakeel).
* STM32 F1/F4. Added an Ethernet driver, ADC drivers, DAC driver,
PWM driver, CAN driver, F4 RTC driver, F4 DMA support,
logic for saving/restoring F4 FPU registers in context switches.
* STM32 Boards. Added STM3240G-EVAL DHPCD and nettest configuration.
Support for a new STM32 board, the HY-Mini STM32v board, was
contributed by Laurent Latil
* PIC32. The port to the Microchip PIC32MX is finally functional and
reliable. The NuttX PIC32 port has verified configurations for
the OS test and the NuttShell (NSH) both exist.
* Tests: New re-usable tests (in apps/examples) for PWM, ADC, and
CAN loopback. Several existing tests can now be built as NSH built-in
applications (dhcpd, nettest, and all of the new tests).

Bugfixes, order roughly on decreasing criticality include:

* STM32: Correct handling of data overrun conditions. Existing logic
would hang with infinite interrupts when a data overrun occurred.
* DHCPD. Fix several problems using host order address where network
addresses expected (and vice versa).

And several others. See the ChangeLog for more details.
