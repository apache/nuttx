NuttX-0.4.12
------------

This is the 44th release of NuttX. This release adds basic support
for the STMicro STM32, Cortex-M3 MCU. The specific port is to the
STMicro STM3210E-EVAL development board based around the STM32F103ZET6
MCU. Some highlights of this port:

* This basic port includes boot-up logic, interrupt driven serial
console, and system timer interrupts.
* Includes a basic STMicro RIDE7 project that can be used to
perform basic STM32 board bring-up (due to RIDE7 size limitations,
it cannot be used for the full NuttX bring-up).
* Working, Tested Configurations: the NuttX OS test and the
NuttShell (NSH) example.

This basic STM32 port will be extended in the 0.4.13 NuttX release.
Functionality needed for complete STM32 support includes: USB
device driver, LCD driver and NX bringup on the development board's
display and MicroSD support. An SPI driver and a DMA support was
included in this 0.4.12 release, but is not yet tested.
