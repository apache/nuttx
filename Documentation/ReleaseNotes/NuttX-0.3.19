NuttX-0.3.19
------------

This is the 31st release of NuttX. This release includes the
following new feature:

* Add poll() and select() APIs that may be used to monitor for
data availability on character devices or TCP/IP sockets.
* Implemented support TCP/IP connection backlog. This allows
select() to wake-up on new connections to a listener socket.
* Added definition of a framebuffer driver and implement framebuffer
drivers for the simulated platform and the TI DM320 (untested
as of the initial check-in).
* Partially developed a graphics framework based on the framebuffer
drivers, however, this will not be ready for use for a few more
releases. Currently this includes only a few color conversion
routines and some rasterizing functions. A tiny windowing system
is under development but not ready for check-in yet.
* Added support for fixed precision math.
* Added support for outgoing multicast packets.

Several bugs were fixed, the most important of which are:

* Fixed an important bug in the TCP/IP buffering logic. When
TCP/IP read-ahead is enabled and not recv() is in-place when a
TCP/IP packet is received, the packet is placed into a read-ahead
buffer. However, the old contents of the read-ahead buffer
were not being cleared and old data would contaminate the newly
received buffer.

* Changed the behavior of the serial driver read. It now returns
data as it is available rather than waiting for the full requested
read size. This makes functions like fgetc() work much more
smoothly.

These changes were verified only on the Neuros OSD (ARM9) using a
Linux development environment. Please report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from November 26, 2008.
