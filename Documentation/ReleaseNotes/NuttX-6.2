NuttX-6.2
---------

The 69th release of NuttX, Version 6.2, was made on May 6, 2011 and
is available for download from the SourceForge website. The 6.2
release includes several new features:

* NXFFS: The obvious new feature is NXFFS, the NuttX wear-leveling
FLASH file system. This new file system is intended to be
small for the MCU usage and has some limitations. No formal
documentation of NXFFS yet exists. See the fs/nxffs/README.txt
file for details (see
http://svn.code.sf.net/p/nuttx/code/trunk/nuttx/fs/nxffs/README.txt?view=log)
* Support for NXP LPCXpresso LPC1768 board on the Embedded
Artists base board. The Code Red toolchain is supported under
either Linux or Windows. Verified configurations include
dhcpd, nsh, nx, ostest, thttpd, and usbstorage.
* Support for the Univision UG-9664HSWAG01 OLED with Solomon
Systech SD1305 LCD controller.
* A new RAM MTD driver with FLASH simulation capability.
* A version.h file is now automatically generated so that C code
can now be version aware.

In addition to these new feature, several important bugfixes are
included in this release correcting problems with dup2(), LPC17xx
GPIO interrupts, LPC17xx UART2/3, the FAT file system, build issues,
and strrch(). See the ChangeLog for more details.
