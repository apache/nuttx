NuttX-0.3.1
-----------

This is the 13th release of NuttX and the second release containing
the integration of a network subsystem and the uIP TCP/IP, UDP, and
ICMP stacks into NuttX (see http://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/index.php/Main_Page).

Many network-related problems have been fixed and the implementation
has matured significantly. However, the level of network reliability
is probably still at the pre-alpha or early level. It is sufficiently
complete that you may begin to perform some network integration and
is expected to achieve beta level of reliability over the next few
releases.

The baseline functionality of NuttX continues to mature and remains at
post-beta (as long as the network is not used).

See the ChangeLog for a complete list of changes.

This release has been verified only on the Neuros OSD (DM320 ARM9)
platform using the DM90x0 driver.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from November 19, 2007.
