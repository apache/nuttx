NuttX-5.15
----------

The 62nd release of NuttX, NuttX-5.15, was made on December 12,
2010. This release includes several bugfixes as well as feature
enhancements, primarily for the Olimex LPC1766-STK board.

Important bugfixes included:

* Additional fixes needed with the TCP sequence number problem
"fixed" in NuttX-5.14.
* In the send() logic, now checks if the destination IP address
is in the ARP table before sending the packet; an ARP request
will go out instead. This improves behavior, for example, on
the first on the first GET request from a browser
* All USB class drivers need to call DEV_CONNECT() when they are
ready to be enumerated. That is, (1) initially when bound to
the USB driver, and (2) after a USB reset.
* The SPI_SETBITS macro was calling the SPI setmode method.
* And several other bug fixes of lower importance (see the
ChangeLog for details).

And feature enhancements:

* The LPC176x Ethernet driver was using all of AHB SRAM Bank0 for
Ethernet packet buffers (16K). An option was added to limit
the amount of SRAM used for packet buffering and to re-use any
extra Bank0 memory for heap.

* Enabled networking and SD/MMC card support in the Olimex
LPC1766-STK NuttShell (NSH) configuration.

* The LPC176x USB driver is now fully fully functional.
* Added an optional cmddata() method to the SPI interface. Some
devices require an additional out-of-band bit to specify if the
next word sent to the device is a command or data. The cmddata
method provides selection of command or data.

* A driver for the Nokia 6100 LCD (with either the Phillips PCF8833
LCD controller and for the Epson S1D15G10 LCD controller) and
an NX graphics configuration for the Olimex LPC1766-STK have
been added. However, neither the LCD driver nor the NX
configuration have been verified as of the this release.
