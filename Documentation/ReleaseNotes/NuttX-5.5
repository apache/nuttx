NuttX-5.5
---------

This is the 52nd release of NuttX. This release includes one new
port, some new drivers and some important bugfixes:

* NuttX was ported to the Luminary/TI LM3S6965 Ethernet Evaluation
Kit. At present, that port includes an OS test configuration
and a NuttShell (NSH) configuration with Telnet support.

MMC/SD and Networking support are provided but not thoroughly
verified in this release: Current development efforts are focused
on porting the NuttX window system (NX) to work with the
Evaluation Kits OLED display.

* A NuttX Ethernet driver for the Microchip ENC28J60 SPI Ethernet
chip is available in the source tree (but has not yet been fully
verified because I haven't properly connected it to hardware
yet).

* The Olimex STR-P711 NuttX port was extended to support the
ENC28J60 and some new networking configurations were added.
The ENC28J60 has not been tested on the STR-P711, however,
because of hardware issues (I don't think the USB powered board
provides enough power for the ENC28J60 and I don't have the
right wall wart yet).

Along the way, external interrupt support (XTI) was added to
the STMicro STR-P711 port and some important bugs were fixed
in the STR-P711 SPI driver.

* Added (optional) floating point support for printf().

* Corrected an important UDP reference counting error. It was
not a serious error, but it trigger an assertion was IS a serious
error.
