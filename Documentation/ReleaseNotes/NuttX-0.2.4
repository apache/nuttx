NuttX-0.2.4
------------

This is the 7th release of NuttX. This release is only to roll out
build changes to better support different SoC's that use the same
processor architecture. In particular, the two existing ARM architectures,
c5471 and DM320 were combined into a single ARM directory. This was done
in preparation for an LPC2148 port that is currently in progress. There
is NO new functionality or significant bugfixes in this release.

See the ChangeLog for a complete list of changes.

This release has been verified on the Linux user-mode platform
and the Neuros OSD using the test program under examples/ostest.
The results of the testing is available in the source tree under
configs/ntosd-dm320/doc/test-results and under configs/sim/doc/test-results.
There are no known, critical defects but the project development status
remains at 'beta' status pending further test and evaluation.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from April 28, 2007.
