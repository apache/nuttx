NuttX-5.11
----------

This is the 58th release of NuttX. This is a bugfix release.

* One very important bug fixes a race condition that can occur
using semaphores that can be awakened by signals. Under this
particular race condition, a task could hang waiting for a
semaphore.
* Corrections to lm3s8962 port contributed by Larry Arnold. That
port is purported to work correctly with these changes in place.

Plus less critical bugfixes as detailed in the ChangeLog. New features
include:

* A new configuration to support the mbed.org LPC1768 board.

* A driver for the Atmel AT45DB161D 4Mbit SPI FLASH part
