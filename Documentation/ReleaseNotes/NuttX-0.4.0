NuttX-0.4.0
-----------

This is the 32nd release of NuttX. This release adds graphics
support and a tiny windowing subsystem. That new graphics subsystem
is documented at http://nuttx.sourceforge.net/NXGraphicsSubsystem.html.
No other substantial changes were made.

These changes were verified only on the NuttX simulation platform
with X11 windows simulating a device framebuffer. Please report any
errors to me.

The version number was bumped up to 0.4.0 in part to reflect the
new graphics subsystem, but also to recognize the NuttX is approaching
complete functionality. In the 0.3.x versions, network support was
added, Pascal P-code runtime support was added, FAT and ROMFS
filesystems were added, MMC/SD and USB device support were added.
There were also numerous extensions to the NuttShell, NuttX APIs,
and architecture ports.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from December 6, 2008.
