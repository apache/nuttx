NuttX-5.9
---------

This is the 56th release of NuttX. This release is difficult to
categorize; NuttX-5.9 was really released because there were too
many changes accumulating in CVS -- a few important, some unfinished
implementations, and a couple of important bugfixes.

* By far biggest change in this release is the complete implementation
of on-demand paging support. This feature will allow you to
execute large programs on a mass storage device (such as SPI
FLASH) in a small RAM. All of the core on-demand paging logic
was completed
(see https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/components/paging.html)
and support was implemented for the ARM-9 family. A test
configuration is in place for the NXP LPC3131. It has been
verified that this new logic does not interfere with normal
fixed-page ARM9 operation, but otherwise this new on-demand
paging feature is untested.
* Add support for the CodeSourcery toolchain to the Olimex-lpc2378
port and for the Neuros OSD port.
* The Neuros OSD port has been updated to work with the production
v1.0 OSD (previously it only worked with the development board).
* And some miscellaneous feature enhancements as detailed in the
ChangeLog.

This includes several important bugfixes:

* NXP LPC17xx - Fixed a critical bug in the GPIO configuration
logic: When attempting to set no pull-up or pull-down (floating),
it would, instead, select pull-down.

* TI/Luminary LM3Sxxxx - Fixed:
(1) A logic error in an address table lookup.
(2) GPIO port encoding the limited support to only 8 GPIO ports.

* Corrected the lease time in the DHCPC implementation: It was
not in host byte order.

* And several other less important bugs as documented in the
ChangeLog: Warnings, cornercase compilation problems, etc.
