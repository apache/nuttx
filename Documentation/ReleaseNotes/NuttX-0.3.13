NuttX-0.3.13
------------

This is the 25th release of NuttX. This release includes some
important bugfixes as well as a few new features. Bugs fixed
include:

* Fixed problems with Cygwin-based console input. NSH now works
with the Cygwin simulator.
* sched_get_priority_max/min returned error on SCHED_RR
* Corrected detection of End-of-File in fgets()
* Fixed an error in opendir() that could cause an assertion to fail
inappropriately.
* Corrected an error in the FAT that caused files opened for writing
with O_APPEND to fail.
* Fix error in getopt() when called with argc==1
* Fix error in stat() when used on the root directory
* Fixed a critical bug that effects the way that environment variables
are shared among pthreads.
* uIP port now supports multi-threaded, concurrent socket access.
So, for example, one thread can be reading from a socket while
another is writing to the socket.

New features were also added:

* New OS APIs: chdir() and getcwd()
* The NuttX shell (NSH) has been extended in many ways.
- New commands: mkfatfs, mkfifo, sleep, usleep, nice, sh, cd, and pwd
- New memory inspection commands and heap usage commands
- New capabilities:
- Execution of commands in background
- Execution of simple scripts
- Redirection of command output
- Last command status ($?)
- Now supports if-then[-else]-fi construct
- Other features as noted in the ChangeLog.

These changes were verified only on the Host simulator under Cygwin
and under Linux and also on the Neuros OSD (ARM9). Please report
any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from September 1, 2008.
