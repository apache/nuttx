NuttX-5.1
---------

This is the 48th release of NuttX. This release adds support for
two new MCU architectures in various states of development:

* AT91SAM3U (http://www.atmel.com/products/at91/sam3landing.asp?family_id=605)

This release adds support for the SAM3U-EK development board with
the AT91SAM3U4E MCU
(http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card_mcu.asp?part_id=4562).
As with most NuttX architecture releases, the release will be
rolled out in two parts: A basic port and an extended port.

NuttX-5.1 includes the basic port for the SAM3U-EK board. This
release passes the NuttX OS test and is proven to have a valid
OS implementation. It supports the basic boot-up, serial console
and timer interrupts. A configuration to support the NuttShell
is also included.

The extended port will also include support for SDIO-based SD
cards and USB device (and possible LCD support). These extensions
may or may not happen by the NuttX 5.2 release as my plate is
kind of full now.

* LPC3131 (http://ics.nxp.com/products/lpc3000/lpc313x.lpc314x.lpc315x/)

This release also adds the complete implementation of the basic
port for the NXP LPC3131 MCU on the Embedded Artists EA3131 board
(http://www.embeddedartists.com/products/kits/lpc3131_kit.php).
That port, unfortunately has stalled due to tools issues. Those
tool issues have been resolved and I am confident that the verified
basic port will be available in NuttX-5.2.

The extended release will follow and should include SDIO-based
SD card support and device USB.

A few additional features and bugfixes of a minor nature were also
incorporated as detailed in the ChangeLog.
