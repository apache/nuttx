NuttX-0.3.0
-----------

This is the 12th release of NuttX. This release includes the initial
integration of a network subsystem and the uIP TCP/IP stack into NuttX
(see http://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/index.php/Main_Page). Also included
is a device driver for the Davicom DM90x0 Ethernet controller.

This integration is very preliminary. Only a small portion of the
network functionality has been integrated and there are a number of
open issues (see the TODO file). The network subsystem is pre-alpha
at this point in time. I expect that it will stabilize and mature
over the next few releases.

The baseline functionality of NuttX continues to mature and remains at
post-beta (as long as the network is not used).

See the ChangeLog for a complete list of changes.

This release has been verified only on the Neuros OSD (DM320 ARM9)
platform using the DM90x0 driver.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from November 6, 2007.
