NuttX-0.4.4
-----------

This is the 36th release of NuttX. This release focuses on bugfixes
and extending and verifying certain networking features.

* Important bugs were fixed in NSH, UDP checksum calculation, UDP
bind() behavior for port==0, the eZ80Acclaim! EMAC driver, Z80
interrupt handling, and in the C libraries.

* Testing was extended to further verify the tiny webserver,
DHCPD, wget(), and sendmail.

See the Changelog for a detailed description of these changes.

These changes were verified only on the ZiLOG eZ80910200zcog-d board
using the ZDS-II toolchain in Cygwin-based environment. Please
report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from March 29, 2009.
