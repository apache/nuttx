NuttX-0.4.8
-----------

This is the 40th release of NuttX. This release adds:

* Support for the Olimex STRP711 board. That board is based on
the STMicro STR711 MCU (ARM7TDMI). Integration is complete on
the basic port (boot logic, system time, serial console). Two
configurations have been verified: (1) The board boots and
passes the OS test with console output visible on UART0, and
the NuttShell (NSH) is fully functional with interrupt driven
serial console. An SPI driver is available but untested (because
the Olimex card slot appears to accept only MMC cards; I have
only SD cards). Additional needed: USB and driver, MMC
integration.

* Support for the CodeSourcery and devkitARM Windows-native GNU
toolchains. Makefiles have been modified for the LM3S6918,
LPC2148, and STR711 to support these toolchains under Cygwin.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from June 13, 2009.
