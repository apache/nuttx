NuttX-0.3.7
-----------

This is the 19th release of NuttX. This release includes the
preliminary port of NuttX to the ZiLOG z16f 16-bit microcontroller.
This port was verified using the ZiLOG z16f2800100zcog Development
and the ZiLOG ZDS-II toolchain. See http://www.zilog.com for
further information.

I emphasize that this is a preliminary release of the z16f port and
is only alpha or, perhaps, pre-alpha quality as of this writing.
There are a list of known issues in the TODO file in the root of
the NuttX directory. The overall quality of NuttX (excluding the
z16f port) continues to improve beyond the late beta level.

The z16f port required numerous changes to NuttX to handle:

* NEAR and FAR addressing, and
* Use of a Windows native toolchain in a Cygwin build environment.

In addition to the z16f port, at least one very critical bug was
found and corrected in NuttX: The thread-specific errno value of one
task was being randomly trashed when a different thread exited.

This release were verified on the ZiLOG z16f2800100zcog, Neuros OSD
(ARM9), and the simulation platforms. As usual, any feedback about bugs
or suggestions for improvement would be greatly appreciated.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from January 31, 2008.
