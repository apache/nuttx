NuttX-4.14
----------

This is the 46th release of NuttX. The release extends the support
for the STMicro STM32 microcontroller. Minimal support for the
STM3210E-EVAL development board based around the STM32F103ZET6 MCU
was released in NuttX-0.4.12 and extended in NuttX-0.4.13 to include
initial USB support. This completes the STM32F103ZET6 and adds:

New Generic RTOS Features:

* Added generic support that can be included in any block driver
to provide read-ahead buffering and write buffering for improved
driver performance.
* Added a generic worker thread that can used to defer processing
from an interrupt to a task.
* Defined a generic SD/SDIO interface can can be bound to a MMC/SD
or SDIO driver to provide SDIO support.
* Implemented a an SDIO-based MMC/SD driver using this new SDIO
interface.

New STM32 Features:

* Add support to configure an STM32 input GPIO to generate an
EXTI interrupt.
* Added support for buttons on the STM3210E-EVAL board.
* Implemented an STM32 version of the common the SDIO interface.
* Added a configuration to exercise the STM32 with the USB mass
storage device class example.

This release also corrects some important bugs in the early STM32 release:

* Correct error handling in the mount() logic.
* Fixed several STM32 DMA-related issues. Integrated and debugged
STM32 DMA functionality that was added in 0.4.12.
* Fixed several bugs in the STM32 USB device-side driver.

NOTE: This version, 4.14, is equivalent to what would have been
called 0.4.14 to follow 0.4.13. The zero has been eliminated from
the front of the version number to avoid confusion about the state
of development: Some have interpreted the leading zero to mean
that the code is in some way unstable. That was not the intent.
Beginning in January 2010, I will switch to the 2010.nn versioning
as many others have done to avoid such confusion.
