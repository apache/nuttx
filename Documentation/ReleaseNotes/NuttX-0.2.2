NuttX-0.2.2
------------

This is the fifth release of NuttX. There is no major new
functionality in this release. This release adds support
for new pthread barrier APIs, changes the directory
structure, to better handle different board configurations
using the same processor architecture, and corrects a few
defects.

See the ChangeLog for a complete list of changes.

This release has been verified on the Linux user-mode
platform and the Neuros OSD using the test program under
examples/ostest. There are no known, critical defects but
the project development status remains at 'beta' status
pending further test and evaluation.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from
March 26, 2007.
