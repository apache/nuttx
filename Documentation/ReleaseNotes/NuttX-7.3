NuttX-7.3
---------

The 103rd release of NuttX, Version 7.3, was made on June 25, 2014,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website. Note
that release consists of two tarballs: nuttx-7.3.tar.gz and
apps-7.3.tar.gz. Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

Additional new features and extended functionality:

* Core OS:

- Dynamic loader: Framework to support Pascal P-Code as a binary
format that can be exec'ed from a file system.
- Dynamic Loader: Extend the binfmt interface to handle error
conditions where format-specific clean-up is needed in the event
of error conditions. This is needed by the P-Code binfmt.

* Networking

- IOB: Add a generic I/O buffer chain logic. This logic uses small,
pre-allocated buffers that can be chained together to support
transfers of any size, using fewer resources and also without
committing in advance to a TCP window size. There is now only
one I/O type used in the networking and it is these I/O buffer
chains.
- TCP Write Buffering: TCP write buffering logic converted to use
I/O buffer chains.
- TCP Read-Ahead Buffering: TCP read-ahead buffering logic converted
to use I/O buffer chains.
- Includes logic to support throttling of read-ahead buffering if
the read-ahead buffering is competing with write buffering for
I/O buffers.
- Raw Sockets: Add support for the AF_PACKET socket family. From
Daniel Lazlo Sitzer.

* Common Drivers:

- W25 Serial FLASH driver extended by Mark Whitehorn to support the
8Mbit W25Q80BV part.
- Add support for Fujitsu MB85RS1MT RAMTRON part. From Charles Ash.
- Enhancements to the generic timer interface to support capture mode
from Bob Doiron.
- Add an rxflowcontrol method to the serial interface to better
support RX flow control. This involves common changes in addition to minor updates to all MCU-specific serial drivers (only fully implemented for the STM32). From Jussi Kivilinna.

* Atmel SAM4C

- Add support for the SAM4CM family. From Max Neklyudov.

* Atmel SAM4E/4S Drivers:

- RTT driver from Bob Doiron. Also added high resolution RTC
emulation using the RTT for the sub-second counter.

* Atmel SAM4E/4S Board Support:

- The SAM4S Xplained Pro now uses the extended timer/counter
features. From Bob Doiron.
- Added a touchscreen and LCD driver for the SAM4E-EK board (the LCD,
however, not yet fully functional).

* Atmel SAMA5:

- Optimized, high performance, assembly language memcpy(). This is
the same optimized memcpy() function that Mike Smith brought in
for the ARMv7-M with minor tweaks by David Sidrane to work with
the ARMv7-A.
- Basic support added for the SAMA5D4 family.

* Atmel SAMA5 Drivers:

- SAMA5D4: New drivers unique to the SAMA5D4: XDMAC, SAIC, and
others.

* Atmel SAMA5 Board Support:

- SAMA5D4-MB: Initial board support for the SAMA5D4-MB/EK boards.

* STMicro STM32

- Add support for the STM32152 and STM32162 Medium+ density parts
(plus miscellaneous other improvements to the original STM32151
logic). From Jussi Kivilinna and Sami Pelkonen.

* STMicro STM32 Boards:

- Support for the Olimex STM32 H405 board contributed by Martin
Lederhilger.

* STMicro STM32 Drivers:

- Implement the rxflowcontrol method to the serial interface to better
support RX flow control. From Jussi Kivilinna.

* NXP LPC17xx Drivers:

- Added support for the RTC, ADC, DAC, Timers, PWM and MCPWM
drivers. From Max (himax).

* NXP LPC17xx Boards:

- Support for the RTC, ADC, DAC, Timers, PWM and MCPWM integrated
in the LPCXpresso LPC1768 board support. From Max (himax).

* Library:

- Add support for seek-able streams.

* Configuration/Build System:

- Restructured network directories, header files, and naming to
better modularize the networking and to better integrate the
networking with the rest of NuttX.

* Applications:

- prun: An NSH built-in application that can be used to run
Pascal P-Code programs either programmatically or from the NSH
command line.
- netpkt: A "raw" socket test from Lazlo Sitzer.
- hex2bin: A library and built-in task to convert from
Intel HEX to binary format. It can write the binary data to a file or it can store the binary data to memory (to support, for example, a loader).

Bugfixes. Only the most critical bugfixes are listed here (see the ChangeLog for the complete list of bugfixes and for additional, more detailed bugfix information):

* Core OS:

- Dynamic Loader: Fix an error in a symbol table search function.
Noted by Pelle Windestam.
- Dynamic Loader: Fix a critical error in exec(); argv was not
being passed.
- mq_notify: Test for a valid signal number was inverted; this
function could not have been working correctly before??? From
eero.nurkkala.
- Fix typo in conditional compilation: CONFIG_CLOCK_MONOTONIC vs.
CLOCK_MONOTONIC. From Manuel St√ºhn.

* Graphics

- Fix typos in several RGB conversion macros.

* Networking:

- Modify TCP timeout handling to provent situations where connections
may not be freed. From Max Holtzberg.
- Improved TCP fallback allocation logic from Max Holtzberg. Also,
fallback mechanism is disabled when SO_LINGER is to prevent
deadlocks.
- Write Buffering: Add checks from buffer allocation failures. From
Max/Himax.

* Network Utilities:

- webserver: httpd_fs_open() should return OK on success and ERROR on
failure, not 1 and 0.

* Common Drivers:

- Make sure that all references to up_prioritize_irq() are
conditioned on CONFIG_ARCH_IRQPRIO. Problem noted by Mike Smith.
- CC3000: Correct SPI mode for CC3000 is CPOL=0 CHPA=1. From Jussi
Kivilinna.
- CC3000: Fix a race condition in thread start-up logic. From Jussi
Kivilinna.
- CC3000: Additional fixes including a compilation failure if POLL is
enabled. From Jussi Kivilinna.

* USB Drivers:

- CDC/ACM and PL2303 device: Reset RX head to avoid resending last
serial data when USB cable disconnected/re-connected. From
Lizhuoyi.

* TI Tiva/Stellaris Boards:

- The Nucleo-F401RE has no on-board crystals and, hence, needs to run
with the PLL input from the on-chip HSI clock.

* STMicro STM32 Drivers:

- Serial: Handle configuration for the case of 8-bit data with
parity. From Freddie Chopin.

* Atmel SAM3/4 Boards:

- There was a cloned error in all SAM3/4 board configurations (and
for a few other architectures as well). Button interrupts not
being disabled after being detached. As a result, unexpected
interrupts could be received after the button interrupt was
detached.

* Atmel SAMA5:

- Fix some critical typos in the SAMA5D3 DMA definitions.

* STMicro STM32 Drivers

- I2C: Add an alternative I2C implementation for the STM32 F103 that
works around errata in that specific part. From Patrizio Simona.
- RTCC: Add retry logic to RTC initialization. It sometimes takes
longer for the RTC to initialize, at least as noted on an F2 part.
From Daniel Lazlo Sitzer.

* NXP LPC17xx Drivers

- GPDMA: Fix an error when DMA is started: The read-modify-write
fails when the DMA is started. This is because the value read is
not the same as the value set (on write it is the number of
transfers to do; on read it is the number of transfers completed).
From Lizhuoyi.

* Library:

- snprintf(): If the size passed to snprintf() is zero, then
snprintf() must write nothing, but instead return the size of the
buffer needed to hold the entire string. From Sami Pelkonen.

* Configuration/Build System:

- The alternate console device CONFIG_NSH_CONDEV must not be defined
unconditionally. This causes errors when using Telnet sessions.
This was solved by adding CONFIG_NSH_ALTCONDEV: CONFIG_NSH_ALTCONDEV enables or disables the feature then, if
enabled, CONFIG_NSH_CONDEV provides the alternative console
device name.
- Many files: Convert all old-style GCC variadic macros to the C99
form. Recent GCC changes tightens up that behavior and can cause
some problems (at least for the IAR compiler for some reason).
Noted by Bob Grimes.
- tools/configure.sh: In-place SED edit messes up permissions on
windows. From Hannes Delago.

* Build Tools:

- tools/mkfsdata.pl: Apparently, the trailing the 0x00 in http
server files is seen as a bug in javascript and images. From
Max/Himax.

* Other Applications:

- I2C Tool: Fix to show the updated register address on each
fetch (vs. showing the same starting address each time). From
Ryan VanSickle.
- CLE was not returning the terminating newline character. But
reported by Max kriegleder.
