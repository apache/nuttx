NuttX-5.6
---------

This is the 53rd release of NuttX. This release includes one several
new drivers for existing NuttX ports:

* This port adds support for the RiT displays P14201 4-bpp,
greyscale OLED. 4-bpp greyscale support was integrated into
the NX graphics sub-system and verified using the TI/Luminary
LP3S6965 Ethernet Evaluation Kit.

* The M25Px driver was extended for the M24P1 FLASH part (see NOTE).

* An I2C driver and (basic) SPI driver were added for the NXP
LPC313x port. The I2C interface definition was extended to
efficiently handle multiple I2C transfers.

As well as a few, important USB-related bugfixes (See the ChangeLog
for details).

This release also includes the beginnings of a port for the NXP
LPC1768 MCU. However, it is too early for that port to be useful
(stay tuned for a future announce of the availability of the LPC1768
port).
