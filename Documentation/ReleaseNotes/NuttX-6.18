NuttX-6.18
----------

The 85th release of NuttX, Version 6.18, was made on May 19, 2012,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website. Note
that release consists of two tarballs: nuttx-6.18.tar.gz and
apps-6.18.tar.gz. Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

The majority of changes in this release are focused on supporting the
synchronized release of NxWM, the NuttX tiny window manager. That
window manager is released as part of the NxWidgets package, but depends
upon many of the changes in this NuttX release.

This release corresponds with SVN release number: r4751

New features and extended functionality:

* Drivers. Added a watchdog timer driver infrastructure. Add general
support for STMicro STMPE811 I/O Expander/touchscreen device.

* STM32. Add support for the STM32 IWDG and WWDG watchodog timers. DMA
now supports circular buffer mode; serial driver now uses circular
DMA to improve Rx performance (Contributed by Mike Smith).

* STM3240G-EVAL Board. Add support for the LCD and for the STMPE811
I/O Expander as a touchscreen controller.

* PIC32 Boards. Board support for the Mikroelektronika PIC32MX7
Multimedia Board (MMB) and for the Sparkfun UBW32 PIC32 board.

* NX. Framed windows are now draw in three colors instead of just two.
Numerous other extensions needed to support NxWM (see the ChangeLog
for details).

* Library. Add prctl() command that can be used to setting and getting
the names of threads. This (plus several other improvements and bug
fixes) are part of a larger effort to improve task monitoring
capabilities.

Work in progress. This release includes some partially completed
work that is still not ready for prime time.

* NFS Client. Work is progressing on support for an NFS client
file system. This is a port of the BSD NFS client file system
that is being done by Jose Pablo Rojas V.

* Automated Configuration. Automated configuration based on the
kconfig-frontends tool is being incorporated into the build
system. The configuration is still not complete enough for
general use in this release.

* STM32 Drivers. Added files that will (eventually) hold an STM32
OTG FS host driver. This is still a work in progress.

Bugfixes (see the change log for details) :

* sched_setscheduler() return value (Contributed by Richard Cochran).

* stdio. Ignore CONFIG_STDIO_LINEBUFFER if the file was opened in binary mode.

* fopen(). Correct an error in parsing open mode string.

* serial driver. Improved performance be reducing the amount of time
that Rx interrupts are disabled.

* recvfrom(). Fix a compilation problem.

* CDC/ACM device driver. Fix an infinite loop that occurs when the serial
device is unregistered.

* STM32 OTG FS device driver. Numerous fixes and the driver is partially
functional but there are still some issues that become apparent when
debug output is disabled.

* fcntl(). Always returned zero on success; however, some fcntl commands
need to return non-zero values on success.

* graphics: Many multi-use mode fixes added to support NxWM (see the
ChangeLog for details). Auto-raise is temporarily disabled in multi-
user mode because it causes some problems with NxWM.

* on_exit(): Fix compilation errors if CONFIG_SCHED_ONEXIT is enabled.
