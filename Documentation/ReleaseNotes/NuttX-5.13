NuttX-5.13
----------

This is the 60th release of NuttX. Headlines for this release
include:

* AVR32, www.mcuzone.com AVR32DEV1

The port for the www.mcuzone.com AVRDEV1 board based on the
Atmel AT32UC3B0256 MCU was (almost) fully integrated. The port
now successfully passes the NuttX OS test (examples/ostest).
A NuttShell (NSH) configuration is in place (see the NSH User
Guide at https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/components/nsh/index.html).
Testing of that NSH configuration, however, has been postponed
(because it got bumped by the Olimex LPC1766-STK port -- see below)

Current Status: I think I have a hardware problem with my serial
port setup. There is a good chance that the NSH port is complete
and functional, but I am not yet able to demonstrate that. At
present, I get nothing coming in the serial RXD line (probably
because the pins are configured wrong or I have the MAX232
connected wrong).

A complete port will include drivers for additional AVR32 UC3
devices -- like SPI and USB --- and will be available in a
later release, time permitting.

* LPC1766, Olimex LPC1766-STK

Support for the Olimex-LPC1766 is newly added to NuttX and is
still undergoing development, test, and integration. Verified
configurations for the NuttX OS test and for the NuttShell (NSH,
see the NSH User Guide at
https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/components/nsh/index.html .
Additional USB configurations are in the release as well, but
they have not yet been verified. Goals for NuttX-5.14 include:
(1) An Ethernet driver, (2) Verified USB support, and (3) SD
card support.

* Additional changes and bugfixes as detailed in the ChangeLog.
