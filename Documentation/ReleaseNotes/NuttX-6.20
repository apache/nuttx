NuttX-6.20
----------

The 87th release of NuttX, Version 6.20, was made on July 12, 2012,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website. Note
that release consists of two tarballs: nuttx-6.20.tar.gz and
apps-6.20.tar.gz. Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

This release corresponds with SVN release number: r4937

Additional new features and extended functionality:

* Power Management: An evolving power management example is being
created by Diego Sanchez. This effort currently involves on the
STM32 F1 but clearly demonstrates the NuttX power management
system which will automatically drive the system to lower power
usage states due to lack of use.

* Drivers: Added a driver for the SST 25 SPI-based FLASH parts.

* PIC32: Added support for the PIC32MX1 and PIC32MX2 families.
Added support for the microchipOpen and Pinguino toolchains.

* NXP LPC43XX: Added support for the entire LPC43xx family

* PIC32 boards: Added support for the DTX1-4000L "Mirtoo" module
from http://www.dimitech.com/ (PIC32MX2).

* NXP LPC43XX Boards: Added support for NGX LPC4330-Xplorer board.

* NXP LPC17XX Boards: Added support for Micromint Lincoln60 board
(LPC1769).

* LM3S Boards: Add a configuration to support the TI/Stellaris
EKK-LM3S3B96 development board. Contributed by Jose Pablo Rojas V.

* Library: NuttX now supports platform-specific stdarg.h header
files.

Work in progress. This release includes some partially completed
work that is still not ready for prime time.

* Automated Configuration. Automated configuration based on the
kconfig-frontends tool is being incorporated into the build
system. The configuration is still not complete enough for
general use in this release.

* STM32 Drivers. Added files that will (eventually) hold an STM32
OTG FS host driver. This is still a work in progress.

Bugfixes (see the change log for details) :

* PIC32: GPIO output configuration (critical bug)
* STM32: Typos in pin mapping files.
* LM3S: Fixed an optimization related but that caused slow start-up
times if optimization was disabled.
* Library: Fixed signed extension but in all limit.h files
(reported by Lorenz Meier). inet_ntoa compilation failure
on Z80.

As well as other, less critical bugs (see the ChangeLog for details)
