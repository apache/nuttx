NuttX-5.8
---------

This is the 55th release of NuttX. This includes several important
bugfixes:

* Corrects some interrupt vectoring for the TI/Stellarix LM3S
port
* Correct initialization logic for NXP LPC17xxx NuttX ports:
Power was not being provided to the GPIO module!
* Corrected (but did not verify) implementation of the optional
interrupt stack feature (all Cortex M3 architectures).
* Correct a HardFault in the LPC17xx SSP driver.

Additional minor fixes are also included as detailed in the ChangeLog.

Several new features have been fully developed and included in this
release, but full verification of most of these new features has
been blocked for a variety of issues:

* Added microSD support for the NuttShell (NSH) configuration in
the Nucleus2G LPC1768 port. For reasons that have not yet been
determined, I have not successfully accessed the microSD card
as of this writing.
* Two USB configurations were also added for the Nucleus2G board:
One to support the USB serial device and one for the USB mass
storage device. Some testing of the USB driver was performed,
but full verification is stalled for an OTG style USB cable.
* LEDs now work correctly on the Nucleus2G LPC1768 board.
* The NuttX/uIP networking subsystem now supports IGMPv2 client.
IGMP (Internet Group Multicast Protocol) network "appliances"
to join into multicast groups. Outbound traffic to enter and
leave multicast groups has been verified, but full verification
will require a switch capable of multicast. Issues associated
with the receipt of multicast packets are likely.
