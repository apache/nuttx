NuttX-0.4.11
------------

This is the 43rd release of NuttX. This release of NuttX incorporates
the verified port of Jeff Poskanzer's THTTPD HTTP server (see
http://acme.com/software/thttpd/). Many of the key features of
THTTPD have been tested on the Micromint Eagle-100 development board
(Cortex-M3). These tests verify:

* Serving of files from any file system
* Execution of CGI executable. This release supports execution
of NXFLAT executables on a ROMFS file system
(https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/components/nxflat.html)

A standard CGI interface is used: Information is pasted to the CGI
program via POST commands and via environment variables. CGI socket
I/O is redirected to stdin and stdout so that the CGI program only
need to printf() to send its content back to the HTTP client.

Another value to this THTTPD integration effort has been that THTTPD
has provided a very good test bed for finding NuttX networking bugs.
Several very critical networking bugs have been fixed with this
0.4.11 release (see the ChangeLog for details). Networking throughput
has also been greatly improved. Anyone using NuttX networking
should consider upgrading to this release.
