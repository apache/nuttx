NuttX-5.17
----------

The 64th release of NuttX, Version 5.17, was made on January 19,
2011 and is available for download from the SourceForge website.
This release follows close on the heels of the 5.16 release and
extends the USB host capabilities first introduced in that version.

* The LPC17xx USB host controller driver was extended to (1) add
support for low-speed devices, (2) handle multiple concurrent
transfers on different endpoints (still only one TD per endpoint),
and (3) handle periodic interrupt endpoint types.

* Add a USB host HID keyboard class driver. Now you can connect
a standard USB keyboard to NuttX and receive keyboard input for
an application.

And other changes as detailed in the ChangeLog.
