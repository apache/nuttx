NuttX-0.4.10
------------

This is the 42nd release of NuttX. This released focused on the
port of Jeff Poskanzer's THTTPD HTTP server (see
http://acme.com/software/thttpd/). As of the 0.4.10 release, that
port is still not fully complete and functional. However, numerous
related bug-fixes and functional additions for THTTPD were added:

* Several new standard C-library functions (fileno, strstr,
strpbrk, fcntl).
* Improved and extended timing APIs (mktime, gmtime, gmtime_r,
gettimeofday, localtime, localtime_r, and strftime)
* Networking enhancements: recvfrom() and accept() now work with
non-blocking sockets.
* NXFLAT extensions (exec)
* Pattern matching logic.
* And miscellaneous bug fixes (see the ChangeLog for details).

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from August 8, 2009.
