NuttX-0.2.6

This is the 9th release of NuttX. This is primarily a

with the 0.2.5 release. This release does include some FAT
filesystem extensions including unlink(), mkdir(), rmdir(),
rename(), opendir(), closedir(), readdir(), seekdir(),
telldir(), rewindir(). There are some pending FAT changes
that did not make it into this release including stat(),
truncate(), and long file names.
