NuttX-6.4
---------

The 71st release of NuttX, Version 6.4, was made on June 5, 2011
and is available for download from the SourceForge website. The
6.4 release includes several new features:

* A new, full-featured FTP client. This client may be used as a library
for automated FTP or via an FTP client shell. The FTP shell
supports the following commands: cd, chmod, get, help, idle,
login, ls, quit, mkdir, noop, put, pwd, rename, rhelp, rm,
rmdir, size, time, and up. A configuration is available for
the NXP LPC17xx to demonstrate this functionality.
* A functional C1101 wireless driver (contributed by Uros Platise)
* A PCI-based E1000 Ethernet driver (contributed by Yu Qiang)
* New C library functions: inet_addr() (contributed by Yu Qiang),
strndup(), asprintf()
* Reduced memory allocation overhead for MCUs with small heaps (<64K).
* fdopen() now works with socket descriptors allowing standard
buffered C functions to be used for network communications.
* The NSH ifconfig command can now be used to set or change the
IP address (contributed by Yu Qiang)

This release also includes some completed but untested functionality.

* The MicroChip PIC32MX port is now code complete and ready to
begin testing. Unfortunately, testing will be delayed due to
tool issues.
* Support for the NXP LPC315x MCUs.

Additional miscellaneous enhancements and bug fixes to task_delete(),
recvfrom(), and other changes as noted in the ChangeLog.
