NuttX-0.4.5
-----------

This is the 37th release of NuttX. This release focuses on a few new features.

* The basic port for the Freescale ARM920T i.MX1 processor on the
Freescale MX1ADS board. Coding is complete for this port, but
it is has not yet fully integrated
* Extended I2C and SPI interface definitions
* Add basic support for C++ applications. Very simple C++
applications can now be built against NuttX without any external
libraries. At present, only the most primitive C++ programs
are supported, but it is hoped that this support will be extended
in future releases.

See the Changelog for a detailed description of these changes.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from April 19, 2009.
