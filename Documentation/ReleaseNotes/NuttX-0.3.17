NuttX-0.3.17
------------

This is the 29th release of NuttX. This release includes the
additional support for USB in NuttX. The following new features
were added:

* Added support for SPI-based MMC/SD cards (with an SPI driver
for the NXP LPC214x).
* Added USB storage class device side driver (BBB)
* Added an example that demonstrates the USB storage class by
exporting the SPI based MMC/SD card on the NXP LPC214x.

This is an early alpha release of these drivers. At present they
only work with debug features enabled so there are probably some
race conditions that occur only with debug features disabled.
(Anyone out there with a USB analyzer? I would love to know what
is happening.)

Several important bugs were also fixed in the FAT file system, USB
serial driver and NXP LPC214x USB controller driver. (See the ChangeLog
for details.)

These changes were verified only on the mcu123.com NXP LPC2148 board
using a Linux development environment. USB testing was performed
using both a Linux host and a WinXP host. Please report any errors
to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from October 28, 2008.
