NuttX-0.3.3
-----------

This is the 15th release of NuttX and the 4th release containing
the integration of a network subsystem and the uIP TCP/IP, UDP, and
ICMP stacks into NuttX (see http://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/index.php/Main_Page).

Many network-related problems have been fixed and the implementation
has matured significantly. This release consists of:

o TCP-related bug-fixes for disconnecting sockets
o Correction of some TCP read-ahead logic
o TCP performance improvements
o Misc. additions and cleanup (See the ChangeLog for a complete list of
changes).

The level of network reliability is at an early beta release level. The
baseline functionality of NuttX continues to mature and remains at
post-beta. Open network-related issues include only:

o Some minor unimplemented BSD socket functionality,
o Thread safety issues: the same socket cannot be used concurrently on
different threads.
o Pending design changes necessary to support multiple network interfaces.
o IPv6 support is incomplete.

This release has been verified only on the Neuros OSD (DM320 ARM9)
platform using the DM90x0 driver. Any feedback for improving the network
reliability/performance would be greatly appreciated.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from November 28, 2007.
