NuttX-6.9
---------

The 76th release of NuttX, Version 6.9, was made on September 11, 2011
and is available for download from the SourceForge website. Note
that release consists of two tarballs: nuttx-6.9.tar.gz and
apps-6.9.tar.gz. Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

This release includes a few new features and several important bug fixes.
The new features (some still incomplete) include:

* Analog Support/ NXP LPC17xx: New DAC sub-system including ADC and DAC
drivers for the LPC17xx. Extensions to the ADS1255 driver.
(Contributed by Li Zhuoyi (Lzyy))

* Power Management: Added a new NuttX power management sub-system for
controlling and coordinating reduced power states. At present, only
verified in a simulation environment.

* I2C Test Tool: A new application was added that can be used to
verify and debug I2C interfaces from the NuttShell (NSH) command
line.

* NuttShell (NSH): In addition to the I2C test tool, a date command
is now supported (if CONFIG_RTC is defined) that can be used to
read and set the RTC.

* NXP LPC17xx: I2C and DAC driver for the NXP LPC17xx family submitted by Li Zhuoyi
(Lzyy)

* Kinetis Cortex-M4: Added a SDHC driver for the Kinetis parts.
Complete debug of the Kinetis SDHC driver was not completed, however,
do to some higher priority tasks that forced me to stop work.

* Other new drivers: Driver for I2C-based at24cxx EEPROM submitted by
Li Zhuoyi (Lzyy); Driver for the LM-75 temperature sensor. Support
for the LM-75 temperature sensor integrated into the SM3210E-EVAL
development board.

* NuttX Graphics (NX): Added new NX interfaces for drawing circles,
both circle outlines and filled circles.

* FLASH: Added a function that accepts the path to a block driver and
then erases the underlying FLASH memory

* Build System: The Make export logic now also tries to track down all
architecture-specific header files and include these in the NuttX
export bundle as well. Various changes and modifications so that
NuttX wil build on FreeBSD using the ASH shell (submitted by Kurt Lidl).

Bugfixes, order roughly on decreasing criticality include:

* STM32 I2C Driver: Add resets, timeout, and other fixes to work
reliably with the I2C tool. Corrected a major error introduced in
NuttX 6.8.

* BCH Driver. Several important bugs (noted by Li Zhuoyi (Lzyy))
were fixed.

* C Library: Fixed errors in gmtime() and gmtime_r() that could lead to
errors in date calculations.

* Timing: Correct an error in the tv_nsec calculation that happens
only config CONFIG_RTC is enabled

* Build System: Use of -print-libgcc-file-name to get path to
libgcc.a might select the wrong libgcc.a if a multilib toolchain
is used
