NuttX-5.7
---------

This is the 54th release of NuttX. This release adds basic support
for one new ARM Cortex-M3 architecture:

* Added support for NXP LPC1768 MCU as provided on the Nucleus
2G board from 2G Engineering (http://www.2g-eng.com).
* Some initial files for the LPC17xx family were released in NuttX
5.6, but the first functional release for the NXP LPC1768/Nucleus2G
occurred with NuttX 5.7.
* That initial basic release included timer interrupts and a
serial console and was verified using the NuttX OS test.
* That release includes a verified NuttShell (NSH) configuration
(see the https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/components/nsh/index.html).
* Also included are unverified SPI and USB device drivers.

Further efforts include:
(1) development of a DMA support library
(2) SPI-based MMC/SD support
(3) verification of the USB driver

Watch for announcement of the completed LPC1768 port expected in
NuttX-5.8.
