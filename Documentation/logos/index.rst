NuttX Logos
===========

The original NuttX logo was created by Greg Nutt (the creator of NuttX) himself.

According with Greg his idea was to create a simple logo with some retro style.

That original vector file was lost and all we have is a PNG file depicting it:

Modern NuttX Logo
-----------------

Some years ago Dave Marples created a representation of the original Logo,
it is very similar to the original Logo and seems more modern:

This logo can be used in websites, promotion materials, etc.

Simplified NuttX Logo
---------------------

There is also a simplified Logo created by Alan C. Assis. This version can be
used on Documentation, T-Shirts and other places where we don't have a huge hue
of colors.
