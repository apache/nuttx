==============================
``tiff`` TIFF Creation Library
==============================

This directory contains a library that can be used to create TIFF image files.
This file was created for the purpose of supporting screen dumps from an LCD.
Howeve, the logic is general and could be used for most any purpose.

The only usage documentation is in the (rather extensive) comments in the file
``apps/include/tiff.h``.

Unit Test
---------

See ``apps/examples/tiff``.
