.. rubric:: uIP Applications

This directory contains most of the network applications contained under the
``uIP-1.0`` apps directory. As the uIP ``apps/README.md`` says, these applications
"are not all heavily tested". These uIP-based apps include: ``dhcpc``, ``smtp``,
``webclient`` and ``webserver``

You may find additional information on these apps in the uIP forum accessible
through: http://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/index.php/Main_Page. Some of these (such
as the uIP web server) have grown some additional functionality due primarily to
NuttX user contributions.
