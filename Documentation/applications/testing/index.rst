Testing
=======

The ``apps/testing`` directory is used to build NuttX-specific tests and to
include external testing frameworks.

There is overlap between what you will find in ``apps/examples`` and
``apps/testing`` in the sense that there are also tests in ``apps/examples`` as
well. Those tests, however, can also be used to illustrate usage of a NuttX
feature. Most of the tests in ``apps/testing``, on the other hand, are pure tests
with little value as usage examples.
