===============================
ELF Programs â€“ No Symbol Tables
===============================

You can easily extend the firmware in your released, embedded system using
ELF programs provided via a file system. For example, an SD card or, perhaps,
downloaded into on-board SPI FLASH.

In order to support such post-release updates, your released firmware must
support execution of ELF programs loaded into RAM and symbol tables also
provided via the file system (see `apps/examples/elf`).

Alan Carvalho de Assis has also made a video based on this example and
published it in the `NuttX YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL6KAgkTb8M>`_.

Creating the Export Package
===========================

At the time of firmware release, you should create and save an export package.
This export package contains all the necessary files required to create
post-release add-on modules for your embedded system.

For demonstration purposes, we'll use the STM32F4-Discovery with the network
NSH configuration. This setup assumes that you have the STM32F4DIS-BB
baseboard. The demonstration also requires support for externally modifiable
media, such as:

- Removable media, like an SD card or USB flash drive.
- An internal file system remotely accessible via USB MSC, FTP, or other
  protocols.
- A remote file system, such as NFS.

In this demonstration, the networking NSH configuration uses the SD card on
the STM32 baseboard. Other NSH configurations can also be used, provided they
supply the necessary file system support.

.. tip::
   No baseboard? You can add file system support to the basic STM32F4-Discovery
   board by following these instructions: `USB FLASH drive <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hB5ZXpRoS4>`__
   or `SD card <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H28t4RbOXqI>`__.

Initialize the environment:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make distclean
   $ tools/configure.sh -c stm32f4discovery:netnsh
   $ make menuconfig

Edit the configuration:

- Disable networking (it is not needed in this example):
  ``# CONFIG_NET is not set``.
- Enable ELF binary support without external symbol tables:
  ``CONFIG_ELF=y``,
  ``CONFIG_LIBC_EXECFUNCS=y``,
  ``# CONFIG_EXECFUNCS_HAVE_SYMTAB is not set``.
- Enable PATH variable support:
  ``CONFIG_LIBC_ENVPATH=y``,
  ``CONFIG_PATH_INITIAL="/addons"``,
  ``# CONFIG_DISABLE_ENVIRON not set``.
- Enable execution of ELF files from NSH: ``CONFIG_NSH_FILE_APPS=y``.

.. note::

   You must enable some application that uses ``printf()``. This is necessary
   to ensure that the symbol ``printf()`` is included in the base system.
   Here we assume that the "Hello, World!" example from ``apps/examples/hello``
   has been enabled with the configuration option ``CONFIG_EXAMPLES_HELLO=y``.

Then, build the NuttX firmware image and the export package:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make
   $ make export

When ``make export`` completes, you will find a ZIP package in the top-level
NuttX directory called ``nuttx-export-x.y.zip`` (where ``x.y`` corresponds to
the version determined by the ``.version`` file in the same directory).
The contents of this ZIP file are organized as follows:

.. code-block:: text

   nuttx-export-x.x
   |- arch/
   |- include/
   |- libs/
   |- registry/
   |- scripts/
   |- startup/
   |- tools/
   |- System.map
   `- .config

Preparing the Add-On Build Directory
====================================

In order to create the add-on ELF program, you will need:

1. The export package.
2. A Makefile to build the program.
3. A first linker script to use in the Makefile (``gnu-elf.ld``).
4. A Bash script to create a second linker script (``defines.ld``).

.. note::

   These example files implicitly assume a GNU tool chain is used and, in at
   least one place, that the target is an ARMv7-M platform. A non-GNU tool
   chain would probably require a significantly different Makefile and
   linker script. There is at least one ARMv7-M specific change that would
   have to be made for other platforms in the script that creates the linker
   script (later on referred to as ``mkdefines.sh``).

Hello Example
=============

To keep things manageable, let's use a concrete example. Suppose the ELF
program that we wish to add to the release code is the simple
source file ``hello.c``:

.. code-block:: c

   #include <stdio.h>

   int main(int argc, char **argv)
   {
     printf("Hello from a fully linked Add-On Program!\n");
     return 0;
   }

Let's say that we have a directory called ``addon`` that contains
the following:

1. The ``hello.c`` source file.
2. A Makefile to build the ELF program.
3. The export package ``nuttx-export-x.y.zip``.
4. A Bash script called ``mkdefines.sh`` that will create the second
   (``defines.ld``) linker script.

Building the ELF Program
========================

The first step in creating the ELF program is to unzip the export
package. Starting in the ``addon`` directory:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd addon
   $ ls
   hello.c Makefile mkdefines.sh nuttx-export-x.y.zip

Where:
- ``hello.c`` is the example source file.
- ``Makefile`` builds the ELF program.
- ``mkdefines.h`` is the Bash script that will create the linker script that will serve as the symbol table.
- ``nuttx-export-x.y.zip`` is the export package from NuttX version ``x.y``.

Unzip the export package and rename the folder for ease of use:

.. code-block:: console

   $ unzip nuttx-export-x.y.zip
   $ mv nuttx-export-x.y nuttx-export

This creates a new directory called ``nuttx-export``, containing
all the content from the released NuttX code required to build
the ELF program.

The Makefile
============

The ELF program is created simply as:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make

This uses the following Makefile to generate several files:

- ``hello.o``: The compiled ``hello.c`` object.
- ``hello.r``: A partially linked ELF object that still has undefined symbols.
- ``hello``: The fully linked, relocatable ELF program.
- ``linker.ld``: The linker script created by ``mkdefines.sh``.

The Makefile used to create the ELF program is as follows:

.. note::

   When copying the following contents, remember that Makefile indentations
   must be made with proper tab characters and not just spaces.

.. code-block:: makefile

   include nuttx-export/scripts/Make.defs

   # Long calls are needed to call from RAM into FLASH

   ARCHCFLAGS += -mlong-calls

   # You may want to check these options against the ones in "nuttx-export/scripts/Make.defs"

   ARCHWARNINGS = -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wshadow -Wundef
   ARCHOPTIMIZATION = -Os -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-strength-reduce -fomit-frame-pointer
   ARCHINCLUDES = -I. -isystem nuttx-export/include

   CFLAGS = $(ARCHCFLAGS) $(ARCHWARNINGS) $(ARCHOPTIMIZATION) $(ARCHCPUFLAGS) $(ARCHINCLUDES) $(ARCHDEFINES) $(EXTRADEFINES)

   # Setup up linker command line options

   LDRELFLAGS = --relocatable

   LDELFFLAGS = --relocatable -e main
   LDELFFLAGS += -T defines.ld -T nuttx-export/scripts/gnu-elf.ld

   # This is the generated ELF program

   BIN = hello
   REL = hello.r

   # These are the source files that we use

   SRCS = hello.c
   OBJS = $(SRCS:.c=$(OBJEXT))

   # Build targets

   .PHONY: clean

   all: $(BIN)

   $(OBJS): %$(OBJEXT): %.c
      $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $<

   System.map: nuttx-export/System.map
      cat nuttx-export/System.map | sed -e "s/\r//g" > System.map

   $(REL): $(OBJS)
      $(LD) $(LDRELFLAGS) -o $@ $<

   defines.ld: System.map $(REL)
      ./mkdefines.sh System.map "$(REL)" > defines.ld

   $(BIN): defines.ld $(REL)
      $(LD) $(LDELFFLAGS) -o $@ $(REL)
      $(STRIP) $@
      #$(CROSSDEV)objdump -f $@

   clean:
      rm -f $(BIN)
      rm -f $(REL)
      rm -f $(OBJS)
      rm -f defines.ld
      rm -f System.map

The Linker Script
=================

Two linker scripts are used: the main one, ``gnu-elf.ld``, is a normal file,
while ``defines.ld`` is created on-the-fly as described in the next section.

The main linker script used in this example is the one from the exported
NuttX package: ``nuttx-export/scripts/gnu-elf.ld``.

            .debug_aranges 0 : { *(.debug_aranges) }
         }

Creating the ``defines.ld`` Linker Script
=========================================

The additional linker script, ``defines.ld``, is created through a three-step
process:

1. The Makefile generates a partially linked ELF object, ``hello.r``.
2. The Makefile then invokes the ``mkdefines.sh`` script, which generates
   the ``defines.ld`` linker script that provides values for all of the
   undefined symbols.
3. Finally, the Makefile produces the fully linked, relocatable ``hello``
   ELF binary using the ``defines.ld`` linker script.

Here are the contents of the ``mkdefines.sh`` script used in this example:

.. code-block:: bash

   #!/bin/bash

   usage="Usage: $0 <system-map> <relprog>"

   # Check for the required path to the System.map file

   sysmap=$1
   if [ -z "$sysmap" ]; then
   echo "ERROR: Missing <system-map>"
   echo ""
   echo "$usage"
   exit 1
   fi

   # Check for the required partially linked file

   relprog=$2
   if [ -z "$relprog" ]; then
   echo "ERROR: Missing <program-list>"
   echo ""
   echo "$usage"
   exit 1
   fi

   # Verify the System.map and the partially linked file

   if [ ! -r "$sysmap" ]; then
   echo "ERROR:  $sysmap does not exist"
   echo ""
   echo "$usage"
   exit 1
   fi

   if [ ! -r "$relprog" ]; then
   echo "ERROR:  $relprog does not exist"
   echo ""
   echo "$usage"
   exit 1
   fi

   # Extract all of the undefined symbols from the partially linked file and create a
   # list of sorted, unique undefined variable names.

   varlist=$(nm "$relprog" | grep -F ' U ' | sed -e "s/^[ ]*//g" | cut -d' ' -f2 | sort - | uniq)

   # Now output the linker script that provides a value for all of the undefined symbols

   for var in $varlist; do
   map=$(grep " ${var}$" "${sysmap}")
   if [ -z "$map" ]; then
      echo "ERROR:  Variable $var not found in $sysmap"
      echo ""
      echo "$usage"
      exit 1
   fi

   varaddr=$(echo "${map}" | cut -d' ' -f1)
   echo "${var} = 0x${varaddr} | 0x00000001;"
   done

This script uses the ``nm`` utility to find all the undefined symbols in the
ELF binary, then searches for the address of each undefined symbol in the
``System.map`` file that was created when the firmware was built. Finally,
it uses the symbols' names and addresses to create each symbol table entry.

.. note::

   For the ARMv7-M architecture, bit 0 of the address must be set to indicate
   thumb mode. If you are using a different architecture that requires
   normal aligned addresses, you will need to change the following line by
   eliminating the ORed value:

   .. code-block:: shell

      echo "${var} = 0x${varaddr} | 0x00000001;"

.. note::

   If the new ELF binary uses a symbol that is not provided in the base
   firmware (and hence not included in the ``System.map`` file) this script
   will fail. In that case, you will need to provide the missing logic
   within the ELF program itself, if possible.

.. important::

   The technique described here is only valid in the FLAT build mode. It
   could probably also be extended to work in the PROTECTED mode by
   substituting ``User.map`` for ``System.map``.

Here is a short example of a ``defines.ld`` script created by ``mkdefines.sh``:

.. code-block:: shell

   printf = 0x0800aefc | 0x00000001;

Replacing NSH Built-In Functions
================================

Files can be executed by NSH from the command line by simply typing the name
of the ELF program, given that the following requirements are met:

1. The feature is enabled with ``CONFIG_NSH_FILE_APP=y``.
2. Support for the PATH variable is enabled with ``CONFIG_LIBC_ENVPATH=y``.
3. The mount point of the file system that may contain ELF programs is
   set in ``CONFIG_PATH_INITIAL``.

Suppose, for example, that a built-in application called ``hello`` already
exist. Before the installation of the new replacement ``hello`` ELF program in
the file system, this is the version of ``hello`` that NSH will execute:

.. code-block:: text

   nsh> hello
   Hello, World!
   nsh>

Now suppose that we add our custom ``hello`` binary to the file system inside
the appropriate path (see ``CONFIG_PATH_INITIAL`` above). When NSH will attempt
to run the program called ``hello``, it will prefer the new binary present on
the file system over the built-in version of the same program.

.. code-block:: text

   nsh> mount -t vfat /dev/mmcsd0 /bin
   nsh> hello
   Hello from a fully linked Add-On Program!
   nsh>

Version Dependency
==================

.. warning::

   This technique generates ELF programs using fixed addresses from the
   ``System.map`` file of a versioned release. The generated ELF programs can
   only be used with that specific firmware version. A crash will most likely
   happen if used with a different firmware version, because the addresses
   from the ``System.map`` will not match.

The alternative approach using :doc:`Symbol Tables <partially_linked_elf>` is
more or less version independent.

Tightly Coupled Memories
========================

Most MCUs based on ARMv7-M family processors support some kind of Tightly
Coupled Memory (TCM). These TCMs have somewhat different properties for
specialized operations. Depending on the bus matrix of the processor, you
may not be able to execute programs from the TCM. For instance, the STM32F4
supports Core Coupled Memory (CCM) but, since it is tied directly to the
D-bus, it cannot be used to execute programs. On the other hand, the STM32F3
has a CCM that is accessible to both the D-Bus and the I-Bus, in which case
it should be possible to execute programs directly from this TCM.

.. image:: ./image/system_arch_stm32f42xx_and_f43xx.png

.. image:: ./image/system_arch_stm32f303xBC_and_f358xC.png

When ELF programs are loaded into memory, such memory is allocated from the
heap via a standard memory allocator. With the STM32F4, the CCM is included
in the heap by default and will typically be allocated first. If CCM memory
is allocated to hold the loaded ELF program, then a hard-fault will occur
immediately when you try to execute it.
Therefore, on STM32F4 platforms it is necessary to include the
``CONFIG_STM32_CCMEXCLUDE=y`` configuration setting. With it, the CCM
memory will be excluded from the heap and will never be allocated for
ELF program memory.
