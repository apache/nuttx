ELF Programs â€“ With Symbol Tables
=================================

You can easily extend the firmware in your released, embedded system using
ELF programs provided via a file system. For example, an SD card or, perhaps,
downloaded into on-board SPI FLASH.

In order to support such post-release updates, your released firmware must
support execution of ELF programs loaded into RAM and symbol tables also
provided via the file system (see `apps/examples/elf`).

Creating a Symbol Table
=======================

There are several ways to create an application symbol table. Only two are
compatible with the example provided here:

1. **Board-specific Bring-up Logic**
   Build a symbol table into the base firmware and add it to your
   board-specific bring-up logic. This technique is typically used in kernel
   mode with ``CONFIG_USER_INITPATH=y``.

   In this setup, the system does not initialize using a standard C call like
   ``nsh_main()``. Instead, it starts with an ``init`` ELF program, similar to
   how Linux initializes. The configuration option
   ``CONFIG_EXECFUNCS_SYMTAB_ARRAY`` initializes the system with a minimal set
   of symbols required by the ``init`` program. Once initialized, the ``init``
   program would typically call ``boardctl()`` to put the final symbol table in
   place.

   To enable this method, you must:

   - Set ``CONFIG_EXECFUNCS_HAVE_SYMTAB=y`` in your configuration.
   - Provide a symbol table with the global name
     ``CONFIG_EXECFUNCS_SYMTAB_ARRAY`` with the variable name
     ``CONFIG_EXECFUNCS_NSYMBOLS_VAR`` that holds the number of symbol entries.
     The default symbol table name is ``g_symtab``
     and its length is ``g_nsymbols``.

   In this example, let's illustrate this using an STM32F4-Discovery
   configuration. We will assume that you have modified the
   ``boards/arm/stm32/stm32fdiscovery/src/stm32_bringup.c`` file, adding the
   following:

   .. code-block:: c

      #include <nuttx/compiler.h>
      #include <nuttx/symtab.h>

      const struct symtab_s g_symtab[] = {
         { "printf", (FAR const void *)printf }
      };

      int g_nsymbols = 1;

   This is a simple symbol table containing only the symbol string "printf",
   whose value is the address of the function ``printf()``.

   This example keeps things simple in order to focus on the core functionality,
   but there is, of course, a lot more that could be said about generating symbol
   tables. NuttX provides specialized tools in the ``tools/`` directory for
   generating more extensive symbol tables: you can start by taking a look at
   ``tools/mksymtab.c``. An example invocation of that tool could be:
   ``./tools/mksymtab -d ./libs/libc/libc.csv <path_to_generated_symtab.c>``.

2. **Application Logic**
   Alternatively, the symbol table can be provided dynamically by the
   application itself, using the ``boardctl()`` system interface. The specific
   ``boardctl()`` command to use is ``BOARDIOC_APP_SYMTAB``. This command
   provides the symbol table in the same way as the board-specific logic but
   allows for application-level control.

   To use this approach, you need to:
   - Enable the configurations ``CONFIG_BOARDCTL=y``
   and ``CONFIG_BOARDCTL_APP_SYMTAB=y``.
   - Include application logic to provide the symbol table.
   If ``CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NSH_SYMTAB=y`` is set, NSH can handle this
   automatically.

Creating the Export Package
===========================

At the time of firmware release, you should create and save an export package.
This export package contains all the necessary files required to create
post-release add-on modules for your embedded system.

For demonstration purposes, we'll use the STM32F4-Discovery with the network
NSH configuration. This setup assumes that you have the STM32F4DIS-BB
baseboard. The demonstration also requires support for externally modifiable
media, such as:

- Removable media, like an SD card or USB flash drive.
- An internal file system remotely accessible via USB MSC, FTP, or other
  protocols.
- A remote file system, such as NFS.

In this demonstration, the networking NSH configuration uses the SD card on
the STM32 baseboard. Other NSH configurations can also be used, provided they
supply the necessary file system support.

.. tip::
   No baseboard? You can add file system support to the basic STM32F4-Discovery
   board by following these instructions: `USB FLASH drive <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hB5ZXpRoS4>`__
   or `SD card <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H28t4RbOXqI>`__.

Initialize the environment:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make distclean
   $ tools/configure.sh -c stm32f4discovery:netnsh
   $ make menuconfig

Edit the configuration:

- Disable networking (it is not needed in this example):
  ``# CONFIG_NET is not set``.
- Enable ELF binary support with external symbol tables:
  ``CONFIG_ELF=y``,
  ``CONFIG_LIBC_EXECFUNCS=y``,
  ``CONFIG_EXECFUNCS_HAVE_SYMTAB=y``,
  ``CONFIG_EXECFUNCS_SYMTAB_ARRAY="g_symtab"``,
  ``CONFIG_EXECFUNCS_NSYMBOLS_VAR="g_nsymbols"``.
- Enable PATH variable support:
  ``CONFIG_LIBC_ENVPATH=y``,
  ``CONFIG_PATH_INITIAL="/addons"``,
  ``# CONFIG_DISABLE_ENVIRON not set``.
- Enable execution of ELF files from NSH: ``CONFIG_NSH_FILE_APPS=y``.

Then, build the NuttX firmware image and the export package:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make
   $ make export

When ``make export`` completes, you will find a ZIP package in the top-level
NuttX directory called ``nuttx-export-x.y.zip`` (where ``x.y`` corresponds to
the version determined by the ``.version`` file in the same directory).
The contents of this ZIP file are organized as follows:

.. code-block:: text

   nuttx-export-x.x
   |- arch/
   |- include/
   |- libs/
   |- registry/
   |- scripts/
   |- startup/
   |- tools/
   |- System.map
   `- .config

Preparing the Add-On Build Directory
====================================

In order to create the add-on ELF program, you will need:

1. The export package.
2. A Makefile to build the program.
3. A linker script to use in the Makefile.

The example Makefile shown below assumes the use of a GNU toolchain. Note
that non-GNU toolchains would likely require a significantly different
Makefile and linker script.

Hello Example
=============

To keep things manageable, let's use a concrete example. Suppose the ELF
program that we wish to add to the release code is the simple
source file ``hello.c``:

.. code-block:: c

   #include <stdio.h>

   int main(int argc, char **argv)
   {
     printf("Hello from a partially linked Add-On Program!\n");
     return 0;
   }

Let's say that we have a directory called ``addon`` that contains
the following:

1. The ``hello.c`` source file.
2. A Makefile to build the ELF program.
3. The export package ``nuttx-export-x.y.zip``.

Building the ELF Program
========================

The first step in creating the ELF program is to unzip the export
package. Starting in the ``addon`` directory:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd addon
   $ ls
   hello.c Makefile nuttx-export-x.y.zip

Where:
- ``hello.c`` is the example source file.
- ``Makefile`` builds the ELF program.
- ``nuttx-export-x.y.zip`` is the export package from NuttX version ``x.y``.

Unzip the export package and rename the folder for ease of use:

.. code-block:: console

   $ unzip nuttx-export-x.y.zip
   $ mv nuttx-export-x.y nuttx-export

This creates a new directory called ``nuttx-export``, containing
all the content from the released NuttX code required to build
the ELF program.

The Makefile
============

To build the ELF program, simply run:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make

This uses the following Makefile to generate several files:

- ``hello.o``: The compiled object file for ``hello.c``.
- ``hello``: The partially linked ELF program.

The Makefile used to create the ELF program is as follows:

.. note::

   When copying the following contents, remember that Makefile indentations
   must be made with proper tab characters and not just spaces.

.. code-block:: makefile

   include nuttx-export/scripts/Make.defs

   # Long calls are needed to call from RAM into FLASH

   ARCHCFLAGS += -mlong-calls

   # You may want to check these options against the ones in "nuttx-export/scripts/Make.defs"

   ARCHWARNINGS = -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wshadow -Wundef
   ARCHOPTIMIZATION = -Os -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-strength-reduce -fomit-frame-pointer
   ARCHINCLUDES = -I. -isystem nuttx-export/include

   CFLAGS = $(ARCHCFLAGS) $(ARCHWARNINGS) $(ARCHOPTIMIZATION) $(ARCHCPUFLAGS) $(ARCHINCLUDES) $(ARCHDEFINES) $(EXTRADEFINES)

   # Setup up linker command line options

   LDELFFLAGS = --relocatable -e main
   LDELFFLAGS += -T nuttx-export/scripts/gnu-elf.ld

   # This is the generated ELF program

   BIN = hello

   # These are the sources files that we use

   SRCS = hello.c
   OBJS = $(SRCS:.c=$(OBJEXT))

   # Build targets

   .PHONY: clean

   all: $(BIN)

   $(OBJS): %$(OBJEXT): %.c
      $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $<

   $(BIN): $(OBJS)
      $(LD) $(LDELFFLAGS) -o $@ $^
      $(STRIP) $@
      #$(CROSSDEV)objdump -f $@

   clean:
      rm -f $(BIN)
      rm -f $(OBJS)

The Linker Script
=================

The linker script used in this example is the one from the exported
NuttX package: ``nuttx-export/scripts/gnu-elf.ld``.

            .debug_aranges 0 : { *(.debug_aranges) }
         }

Replacing NSH Built-In Functions
================================

Files can be executed by NSH from the command line by simply typing the name
of the ELF program, given that the following requirements are met:

1. The feature is enabled with ``CONFIG_NSH_FILE_APP=y``.
2. Support for the PATH variable is enabled with ``CONFIG_LIBC_ENVPATH=y``.
3. The mount point of the file system that may contain ELF programs is
   set in ``CONFIG_PATH_INITIAL``.

In this example, there is no application in the base firmware called
``hello``. So attempts to run ``hello`` will fail:

.. code-block:: text

   nsh> hello
   nsh: hello: command not found
   nsh>

But if we mount the SD card containing the ``hello`` binary that we created
above, then we can successfully execute the ``hello`` command:

.. code-block:: text

   nsh> mount -t vfat /dev/mmcsd0 /addons
   nsh> ls /addons
   /addons:
    hello
   nsh> hello
   Hello from a partially linked Add-On Program!
   nsh>

This showed that you can add a new NSH command to a product without
modifying the base firmware, but you can also replace or update an existing
built-in application: in the above configuration, NSH will first attempt to
run the program called ``hello`` from the file system; this will fail because
the custom ``hello`` ELF program is not yet available. So instead, NSH will
fallback and execute the built-in application called ``hello``. This way,
any command known to NSH can be replaced from an ELF program installed in a
mounted file system directory specified in the PATH environment variable:
after adding the custom ``hello`` binary to the file system, NSH will prefer it
over the built-in version when attempting to run the program called ``hello``.

Tightly Coupled Memories
========================

Most MCUs based on ARMv7-M family processors support some kind of Tightly
Coupled Memory (TCM). These TCMs have somewhat different properties for
specialized operations. Depending on the bus matrix of the processor, you
may not be able to execute programs from the TCM. For instance, the STM32F4
supports Core Coupled Memory (CCM) but, since it is tied directly to the
D-bus, it cannot be used to execute programs. On the other hand, the STM32F3
has a CCM that is accessible to both the D-Bus and the I-Bus, in which case
it should be possible to execute programs directly from this TCM.

.. image:: ./image/system_arch_stm32f42xx_and_f43xx.png

.. image:: ./image/system_arch_stm32f303xBC_and_f358xC.png

When ELF programs are loaded into memory, such memory is allocated from the
heap via a standard memory allocator. With the STM32F4, the CCM is included
in the heap by default and will typically be allocated first. If CCM memory
is allocated to hold the loaded ELF program, then a hard-fault will occur
immediately when you try to execute it.
Therefore, on STM32F4 platforms it is necessary to include the
``CONFIG_STM32_CCMEXCLUDE=y`` configuration setting. With it, the CCM
memory will be excluded from the heap and will never be allocated for
ELF program memory.
