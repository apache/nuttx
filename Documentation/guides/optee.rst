=======================
Interfacing with OP-TEE
=======================

Overview
========

NuttX supports basic interfacing with OP-TEE OS through three different
transports: local network, RPMsg, and native Secure Monitor Calls (SMCs)
on arm. Tasks can interface with the OP-TEE driver (and in turn with the
OP-TEE OS) via IOCTLs on the TEE (``/dev/tee#``) character device. This
interface should allow use-of/integration-with libteec, although this is
not officially supported by NuttX, and is out of the scope of this guide.

The driver supports opening and closing sessions, allocating and registering
shared memory, and invoking functions on OP-TEE Trusted Applications (TAs).
It does not (yet) support reverse direction commands (TA -> Normal World)
to something like a TEE supplicant.

Enabling the OP-TEE Driver
==========================

The driver is enabled using one of:

- ``CONFIG_DEV_OPTEE_LOCAL``
- ``CONFIG_DEV_OPTEE_RPMSG``
- ``CONFIG_DEV_OPTEE_SMC``

All of the above require also ``CONFIG_ALLOW_BSD_COMPONENTS`` and
``CONFIG_LIBC_MEMFD_SHMFS``, which in turn requires ``CONFIG_FS_SHMFS``. So,
at a bare minimum, to enable the driver one would need something like the
following:

.. code-block::

  CONFIG_ALLOW_BSD_COMPONENTS=y
  CONFIG_DEV_OPTEE_SMC=y
  CONFIG_FS_SHMFS=y
  CONFIG_LIBC_MEMFD_SHMFS=y

Each implementation (local, RPMsg, or SMC) may have further dependencies
(e.g. RPMsg requires ``CONFIG_NET_RPMSG`` and more) and may have further
parameters to configure (e.g. RPMsg remote CPU name through
``CONFIG_OPTEE_REMOTE_CPU_NAME``).

.. warning::
  ``CONFIG_DEV_OPTEE_SMC`` has only been tested on arm64. Also, please note
  that in configurations with ``CONFIG_ARM*_DCACHE_DISABLE=y`` you might
  encounter issues with shared memory depending on the state of the data
  cache in Secure World.

Successful registration of the driver can be verified by looking into
``/dev/tee0``. For instance, incompatibility with the TEE OS running in the
system, will prevent the ``/dev/tee0`` character device from being
registered.

IOCTLs supported
================

All IOCTLs return negative error codes on failure. All of them return 0
on success unless otherwise specified (see ``TEE_IOC_SHM_ALLOC``).

- ``TEE_IOC_VERSION`` : Query the version and capabilities of the TEE driver.

  - Use the ``struct tee_ioctl_version_data`` to get the version and
    capabilities. This driver supports OP-TEE so you should expect to
    receive only ``TEE_IMPL_ID_OPTEE`` in ``.impl_id`` and ``TEE_OPTEE_CAP_TZ``
    in ``.impl_caps``. The driver is GlobalPlatform compliant, and you should
    always expect to receive ``TEE_GEN_CAP_GP | TEE_GEN_CAP_MEMREF_NULL`` in
    ``.gen_caps``. If using the SMC implementation, the driver supports also
    shared memory registration, so you can expect also ``TEE_GEN_CAP_REG_MEM``
    in ``.gen_caps``.

- ``TEE_IOC_OPEN_SESSION`` :  Open a session with a Trusted Application.

  - Expects a ``struct tee_ioctl_buf_data`` pointer, pointing to a
    ``struct tee_ioctl_open_session_arg`` instance with at minimum, the ``.uuid``
    set. You can typically use ``uuid_enc_be()`` to encode a ``uuid_t`` struct
    to the raw byte buffer expected in the ``.uuid`` field. After a successful
    call, you can expect to get a session identifier back in the ``.session``
    field.

- ``TEE_IOC_CLOSE_SESSION`` : Close a session with a Trusted Application.

  - Expects a pointer to a ``struct tee_ioctl_close_session_arg`` with the
    ``.session`` field set to the identifier of the session to close.

- ``TEE_IOC_INVOKE`` : Invoke a function on a previously opened session to a Trusted Application.

  - Expects a ``struct tee_ioctl_buf_data`` pointer, pointing to a
    ``struct tee_ioctl_invoke_arg`` instance. You can use the
    ``TEE_IOCTL_PARAM_SIZE()`` macro to calculate the size of the
    variable-length array of ``struct tee_ioctl_param`` parameters in the
    invoke arguments struct. At minimum, the interface expects the fields
    ``.func``, ``.session``, ``.num_params``, and ``.params`` to be set.
    ``.cancel_id`` can be optionally set to enable later canceling of this
    command if needed.
    You might notice that ``struct tee_ioctl_param`` has rather obscure field
    names (``.a``, ``.b``, ``.c``). This can be improved with a union in the
    future, but until then, please refer to ``include/nuttx/tee.h`` for details.
    In short, for shared memory references, ``.a`` is the offset into the
    shared memory buffer, ``.b`` is the size of the buffer, and ``.c`` is the
    the shared memory identifier (``.id`` field returned by
    ``TEE_IOC_SHM_ALLOC`` or ``TEE_IOC_SHM_REGISTER``).

- ``TEE_IOC_CANCEL`` : Cancel a currently invoked command.

  - Expects a ``struct tee_ioctl_cancel_arg`` pointer with the ``.session``
    and ``.cancel_id`` fields set.

- ``TEE_IOC_SHM_ALLOC`` : Allocate shared memory between the user space and the secure OS.

  - Expects a ``struct tee_ioctl_shm_alloc_data`` pointer with the ``.size``
    field set, and ignoring the ``.flags`` field. Upon successful return,
    it returns the memory file descriptor one can use ``mmap()`` on (with
    ``MAP_SHARED``). It also returns an identifier for use in memory references
    (``tee_ioctl_param.c`` field) in ``.id``.

- ``TEE_IOC_SHM_REGISTER`` : Register a shared memory reference with the secure OS.

  - Expects a pointer to a ``struct tee_ioctl_shm_register_data`` instance
    with all fields set except ``.id``. ``.flags`` can be any combination of
    ``TEE_SHM_REGISTER`` and ``TEE_SHM_SEC_REGISTER`` but not ``TEE_SHM_ALLOC``.
    ``TEE_SHM_REGISTER`` registers the memory with the driver for automatic
    cleanup (not freeing!) during ``/dev/tee#`` character device close.
    ``TEE_SHM_SEC_REGISTER`` registers the memory with the secure OS for later
    use in memrefs and is automatically de-registered during driver close if
    ``TEE_SHM_REGISTER`` is also specified. ``.addr`` shall point to the (user)
    memory to register and ``.size`` shall indicate its size. One may use the
    returned ``.id`` field when specifying shared memory references
    (``tee_ioctl_param.c`` field).
