How to use RNDIS
================

This guide explains the steps needed to get USB RNDIS working, using
the STM32F4Discovery board as example.

If you don't know RNDIS, it is a way to share Ethernet-like connection
over USB port without using any external device to it. Just a USB cable
between your board (that has USB Device) and your computer.

WARNING: RNDIS is going to be removed from Linux kernel because they
understand it as an unsecure protocol. That said use it aware of this
risk and also be aware that it was tested up to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and
couldn't work in future versions.

Compiling
=========

#. Configure the RNDIS

   There is a sample configuration to use RNDIS on stm32f4discovery
   board. If your board doesn't save a sample example then you need
   to create a configuration by yourself looking this config.

   Just use ``stm32f4discovery:rndis`` board profile for this purpose. 

    .. code-block:: console

       $ cd nuttx
       $ ./tools/configure.sh stm32f4discovery:rndis

#. Compile

    .. code-block:: console

       $ make -j

Flashing
========

#. Flash the generated nuttx.bin to your board:

    .. code-block:: console

       $ $ sudo openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32f4x.cfg -c init -c "reset halt" -c "flash write_image erase nuttx.bin 0x08000000"
       ...

Setup RNDIS in your computer
============================

   These steps show how to connect your board to your Linux machine.

.. todo:: Add Mac and Windows instructions

#. Reset your board

#. Plug a USB cable from the STM32F4Discovery's microUSB to your computer

#. Confirm that your board was detected as a USB RNDIS device:

    .. code-block:: console

       $ dmesg
       ...
       [ 1099.821480] usb 3-3: new full-speed USB device number 12 using xhci_hcd

       [ 1099.997001] rndis_host 3-3:1.0 enxa0e0deadcafe: renamed from eth0

#. Configure your Linux distro to share network to this USB RNDIS device:

   Click in the top right corner of your Ubuntu and go to:

   NuttX Ethernet -> Wired Settings

   Click in the 'Gear icon' and in the tab "IPv4" select: "Shared to other computers"

   Click on "Apply"

   Disconnect and connect the USB cable to force it to get IP.

#. Identify what IP address your board got:

    .. code-block:: console

       $ tail -f /var/log/syslog
       ...

#. Ping this IP to confirm it is working:

    .. code-block:: console

       $ ping 10.42.0.86
