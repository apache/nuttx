Configurations
==============

nsh
---

Basic NuttShell configuration (console enabled in USART0, pins PD0 (RXD0) and PD1 (TXD0), at 115200 bps).

Compile
=======

Note that build with GCC disables CONFIG_DEBUG_OPT_UNUSED_SECTIONS
by default. This is because the linker script was not checked
to determine if it properly prevents removal of sections which
the linker considers unreferenced but which must be present
in the binary.

Flash & Debug
=============

You can flash the board using avrdure. First press and hold SW0 button, then press and release RESET button, after 1 second release the SW0 button. Now run the command::

    $ avrdude -p atmega1284p -c avr910 -P /dev/ttyACM0 -b57600 -F -u -U flash:w:nuttx.hex:i
