=========

This is a port of NuttX to the Atmel AVR32DEV1 board.  That board is
based on the Atmel AT32UC3B0256 MCU and uses a specially patched
version of the GNU toolchain:  The patches provide support for the
AVR32 family.  That patched GNU toolchain is available only from the
Atmel website.  STATUS: This port is functional but very basic.  There
are configurations for NSH and the OS test.
