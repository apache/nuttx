Freescale M68HCS12
------------------

**MC9S12NE64**. Support for the MC9S12NE64 MCU and two boards are
included:

-  The Freescale DEMO9S12NE64 Evaluation Board, and
-  The Future Electronics Group NE64 /PoE Badge board.

Both use a GNU arm-nuttx-elf toolchain\* under Linux or Cygwin. The
NuttX `buildroot <https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/buildroot/downloads/>`__
provides a properly patched GCC 3.4.4 toolchain that is highly optimized
for the m9s12x family.
