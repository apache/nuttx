(MIPS M4K architecture)

Microchip PIC32MX2xx
--------------------

A port is in progress from the DTX1-4000L "Mirtoo"
module from `Dimitech <http://www.dimitech.com/>`__. This module uses
Microchip PIC32MX250F128D and the Dimitech DTX1-4000L EV-kit1 V2. See
the `Dimitech <http://www.dimitech.com/>`__ website for further
information.

Microchip PIC32MX4xx
--------------------

**PIC32MX440F512H**. This port uses the "Advanced USB Storage Demo
Board," Model DB-DP11215, from `Sure
Electronics <http://www.sureelectronics.net>`__. This board features the
Microchip PIC32MX440F512H.

**PIC32MX460F512L**. There one two board ports using this chip:

-  **PIC32MX Board from PCB Logic Design Co**. This port is for the
   PIC32MX board from PCB Logic Design Co. and used the PIC32MX460F512L.
   The board is a very simple -- little more than a carrier for the
   PIC32 MCU plus voltage regulation, debug interface, and an OTG
   connector.
-  **UBW32 Board from Sparkfun** This is the port to the Sparkfun UBW32
   board. This port uses the `original
   v2.5 <http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8971>`__ board which is based
   on the Microchip PIC32MX460F512L. This older version has been
   replaced with this `newer
   board <http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9713>`__. See also the
   `UBW32 <http://www.schmalzhaus.com/UBW32/>`__ web site.

Microchip PIC32MX7xx
--------------------

PIC32MX795F512L. There one two board ports using this chip:

-  **Microchip PIC32 Ethernet Starter Kit**. This port uses the
   Microchip PIC32 Ethernet Starter Kit (DM320004) with the Expansion
   I/O board. See the `Microchip website <http://www.microchip.com>`__
   for further information.
-  **Mikroelektronika PIC32MX7 Mulitmedia Board (MMB)**. A port has been
   completed for the Mikroelektronika PIC32MX7 Multimedia Board (MMB).
   See http://www.mikroe.com/ for further information about this board.

**Development Environment:** These ports uses either:

#. The *LITE* version of the PIC32MX toolchain available for download
   from the `Microchip <http://www.microchip.com>`__ website, or
#. The Pinguino MIPS ELF toolchain available from the Pinguino
   `website <https://code.google.com/archive/p/pinguino32/>`__.
#. The MIPS SDE toolchain available from the `Mentor
   Graphics <http://www.mentor.com>`__ website.
