=====================

This README file discusses the port of NuttX to the "Advanced USB Storage
Demo Board," Model DB-DP11215, from Sure Electronics
(http://www.sureelectronics.net/).  This board features the MicroChip
PIC32MX440F512H.  See also http://www.sureelectronics.net/goods.php?id=1168
for further information about the Sure DB-DP11215 board.

DB_DP11215 PIC32 Storage Demo Board

  - PIC32MX44F512H
  - SD card slot
  - RS-2323 Interface
  - USB (MINI-B)
  - 2x16 LCD display
  - Three tactile switches
  - Four user LEDs

Also available (but not yet supported).

DB-DP11212 PIC32 General Purpose Demo Board

  - PIC32MX44F512H
  - LM75A temperature sensor and temperature resistor (NTC-SMD thermistor)
  - SPI FLASH: AT25DF041A
  - USB (MINI-B)
  - 2x16 LCD display
  - 4 digit, 8 segment LED display
  - Three tactile switches
  - Four user LEDs

NOTE:  I see that Sure Electronics shows both of these boards at end-of-Life
(EOL).  So I assume that these boards will no longer be generally available.
This work should still be useful, however, for other PIC32MX4-based boards
(2012-5-27).

  I am using the free, "Lite" version of the PIC32MX toolchain available
  for download from the microchip.com web site.  I am using the Windows
  version.  The MicroChip toolchain is the only toolchain currently
  supported in these configurations, but it should be a simple matter to
  adapt to other toolchains by modifying the Make.defs file include in
  each configuration.

    CONFIG_MIPS32_TOOLCHAIN_MICROCHIPW      - MicroChip full toolchain for Windows
    CONFIG_MIPS32_TOOLCHAIN_MICROCHIPL      - MicroChip full toolchain for Linux
    CONFIG_MIPS32_TOOLCHAIN_MICROCHIPW_LITE - MicroChip "Lite" toolchain for Windows
    CONFIG_MIPS32_TOOLCHAIN_MICROCHIPL_LITE - MicroChip "Lite" toolchain for Linux
    CONFIG_MIPS32_TOOLCHAIN_PINGUINOL       - Pinquino toolchain for Linux
    CONFIG_MIPS32_TOOLCHAIN_PINGUINOW       - Pinquino toolchain for Windows
    CONFIG_MIPS32_TOOLCHAIN_MICROCHIPOPENL  - Microchip open toolchain for Linux
    CONFIG_MIPS32_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_ELF         - General mips-elf toolchain for Linux

  NOTE:  The "Lite" versions of the toolchain does not support C++.  Also
  certain optimization levels are not supported by the "Lite" toolchain.

  MicrochipOpen
  -------------

  An alternative, build-it-yourself toolchain is available here:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/microchipopen/ .  These tools were
  last updated circa 2010.  NOTE:  C++ support still not available
  in this toolchain.

  Building MicrochipOpen (on Linux)

  1) Get the build script from this location:

      http://microchipopen.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/microchipopen/ccompiler4pic32/buildscripts/trunk/

  2) Build the code using the build script, for example:

      ./build.sh -b v105_freeze

     This will check out the selected branch and build the tools.

  3) Binaries will then be available in a subdirectory with a name something like
     pic32-v105-freeze-20120622/install-image/bin (depending on the current data
     and the branch that you selected.

     Note that the tools will have the prefix, mypic32- so, for example, the
     compiler will be called mypic32-gcc.

  Penguino mips-elf Toolchain
  ---------------------------

  Another option is the mips-elf toolchain used with the Penguino project.  This
  is a relatively current mips-elf GCC and should provide free C++ support as
  well. This toolchain can be downloaded from the Penguino website:
  http://wiki.pinguino.cc/index.php/Main_Page#Download .

  See also boards/mirtoo/README.txt.  There is an experimental (untested)
  configuration for the Mirtoo platform in that directory.

  MPLAB/C32 vs MPLABX/X32
  -----------------------

  It appears that Microchip is phasing out the MPLAB/C32 toolchain and replacing
  it with MPLABX and XC32.  At present, the XC32 toolchain is *not* compatible
  with the NuttX build scripts.  Here are some of the issues that I see when trying
  to build with XC32:

  1) Make.def changes:  You have to change the tool prefix:

     CROSSDEV=xc32-

  2) debug.ld/release.ld:  The like expect some things that are not present in
     the current linker scripts (or are expected with different names).  Here
     are some partial fixes:

     Rename:  kseg0_progmem to kseg0_program_mem
     Rename:  kseg1_datamem to kseg1_data_mem

  Even then, there are more warnings from the linker and some undefined symbols
  for non-NuttX code that resides in the unused Microchip libraries.  You will
  have to solve at least this undefined symbol problem if you want to used the
  XC32 toolchain.

  Windows Native Toolchains
  -------------------------

  NOTE:  There are several limitations to using a Windows based toolchain in a
  Cygwin environment.  The three biggest are:

  1. The Windows toolchain cannot follow Cygwin paths.  Path conversions are
     performed automatically in the Cygwin makefiles using the 'cygpath' utility
     but you might easily find some new path problems.  If so, check out 'cygpath -w'

  2. Windows toolchains cannot follow Cygwin symbolic links.  Many symbolic links
     are used in NuttX (e.g., include/arch).  The make system works around these
     problems for the Windows tools by copying directories instead of linking them.
     But this can also cause some confusion for you:  For example, you may edit
     a file in a "linked" directory and find that your changes had no effect.
     That is because you are building the copy of the file in the "fake" symbolic
     directory.  If you use a Windows toolchain, you should get in the habit of
     making like this:

       make clean_context all

     An alias in your .bashrc file might make that less painful.

Loading NuttX with PICkit2
==========================

  NOTE:  You need a PICKit3 if you plan to use the MPLAB debugger!  The PICKit2
  can, however, still be used to load programs.  Instructions for the PICKit3
  are similar.

  Intel Hex Forma Files:
  ----------------------

    When NuttX is built it will produce two files in the top-level NuttX
    directory:

    1) nuttx - This is an ELF file, and
    2) nuttx.hex - This is an Intel Hex format file.  This is controlled by
       the setting CONFIG_INTELHEX_BINARY in the .config file.

    The PICkit tool wants an Intel Hex format file to burn into FLASH. However,
    there is a problem with the generated nutt.hex: The tool expects the nuttx.hex
    file to contain physical addresses.  But the nuttx.hex file generated from the
    top-level make will have address in the KSEG0 and KSEG1 regions.

  tools/pic32/mkpichex:
  ----------------------

    There is a simple tool in the NuttX tools/pic32 directory that can be
    used to solve both issues with the nuttx.hex file.  But, first, you must
    build the tool:

      cd tools/pic32
      make -f Makefile.host

    Now you will have an executable file call mkpichex (or mkpichex.exe on
    Cygwin).  This program will take the nutt.hex file as an input, it will
    convert all of the KSEG0 and KSEG1 addresses to physical address, and
    it will write the modified file, replacing the original nuttx.hex.

    To use this file, you need to do the following things:

      export PATH = ??? # Add the NuttX tools/pic32 directory to your
                        # PATH variable
      make              # Build nuttx and nuttx.hex
      mkpichex $PWD     # Convert addresses in nuttx.hex.  $PWD is the path
                        # to the top-level build directory.  It is the only
                        # required input to mkpichex.

      This procedure is automatically performed at the end of a build.

LCD1602
=======

  The on-board LCD is a 2x16 segment LCD and appears to be compatible with
  the LCD1602 and is treated like an LCD1602 LCD here.

  PIC32MXx USB Device Configuration

  PIC32MXx USB Host Configuration (the PIC32MX does not support USB Host)

Configurations
==============

  Each PIC32MX configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and can be
  selected as follow:

    tools/configure.sh sure-pic32mx:<subdir>

  Where <subdir> is one of the following sub-directories.

  NOTE:  These configurations use the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
  change any of these configurations using that tool, you should:

    a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
       see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

    b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
       reconfiguration process.

Configuration sub-directories
-----------------------------

Where <subdir> is one of the following:

  nsh:
  ====
    Description.
    ------------
    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at apps/examples/nsh.  The
    Configuration enables only the serial NSH interface.

    Notes.
    -----
    1. By default, this configuration uses an older Microchip C32 toolchain
       for Windows (the newer ones seem to be incompatible) and builds under
       Cygwin (or probably MSYS).  That can easily be reconfigured, of course.

       Build Setup:
         CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y    : Builds under Windows
         CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y  : Using Cygwin

       System Type:
         CONFIG_MIPS32_TOOLCHAIN_MICROCHIPW_LITE=y : Older C32 toolchain

    2. USB Configurations.

      Several USB device configurations can be enabled and included
      as NSH built-in built in functions.  All require the following
      basic setup in your .config to enable USB device support:

        Drivers:
          CONFIG_USBDEV=y           : Enable basic USB device support

       System Type -> PIC32MX Peripheral Support:
          CONFIG_PIC32MX_USBDEV=y   : Enable PIC32 USB device support

      system/cdcacm -  The system/cdcacm program can be included as an
      function by dding the following to the NuttX configuration file:

        Application Configuration->Examples:
          CONFIG_SYSTEM_CDCACM=y  : Select apps/system/cdcacm

      and defining the following in your .config file:

        Drivers->USB Device Driver Support
          CONFIG_CDCACM=y           : Enable the CDCACM device

      system/usbmsc - To enable the USB mass storage class (MSC)device,
      you would need to add the following to the NuttX configuration file.
      However, this device cannot work until support for the SD card is
      also incorporated.

        Drivers->USB Device Driver Support
          CONFIG_USBMSC=y           : Enables the USB MSC class

        Application Configuration->Examples:
          CONFIG_SYSTEM_USBMSC=y  : Enhables apps/system/usbmsc

    3. SD Card Support.

      Support for the on-board, SPI-based SD card is available but is
      not yet functional (at least at the time of this writing).  SD
      card support can be enabled for testing by simply enabling SPI2
      support in the configuration file:

       System Type -> PIC32MX Peripheral Support:
         CONFIG_PIC32MX_SPI2=y      : Enable SPI2

       Drivers:
         CONFIG_MMCSD=y             : MMC/SD support
         CONFIG_MMCSD_SPI=y         : SPI-based MMC/SD support

       File Systems:
         CONFIG_FS_FAT=y            : FAT file system
                                    : Other FAT options

    Debug output for testing the SD card can be enabled using:

       Build Setup:
         CONFIG_DEBUG_FEATURES=y    : Enable debug features
         CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y        : Enable verbose debug output
         CONFIG_DEBUG_FS=y          : Enable file system debug
         CONFIG_DEBUG_SPI=y         : Enable SPI debug

    4. To enable LCD1602 support:

       Device Drivers ->LCD Driver Support:
         CONFIG_LCD=y               : Enable LCD menus
         CONFIG_LCD_LCD1602=y       : Select LCD1602
         CONFIG_LCD_MAXCONTRAST=255 : (Or any large-ish value that you prefer)
         CONFIG_LCD_MAXPOWER=255    : (Or any large-ish value that you prefer)

       Library Routines:
         CONFIG_LIBC_SLCDCODEC=y     : Enable the SLCD CODEC

       NOTE that is is not necessary to select the PMP peripheral; this LCD
       driver is a bit-bang driver that just happens to use the PMP pins as
       GPIOS.

       To enable apps/examples/slcd to test the LCD:

       Application Configuration -> NSH Library:
         CONFIG_NSH_ARCHINIT=y      : Needed to initialize the SLCD

       Application Configuration -> Examples:
         CONFIG_EXAMPLES_SLCD=y     : Enable apps/examples/slcd use /dev/lcd1602
         CONFIG_EXAMPLES_SLCD_DEVNAME="/dev/lcd1602"

       To enable LCD debug output:

       Build Setup -> Debug Options:
         CONFIG_DEBUG_FEATURES=y             : Enable debug features
         CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y     : Enable verbose debug output
         CONFIG_DEBUG_LCD=y         : Enable LCD debug output

       NOTES:
       2013-05-27: The LCD1602 has been verified on the DB-DP11212 using
         this configuration.  It has not been used with the usbnsh configuration
         or with the DB-11112 board.  It looks to me like the connection to the
         LCD1602 is identical on the DB-11112 and so I would expect that to work.

         At this point in time, testing of the SLCD is very limited because
         there is not much in apps/examples/slcd.  Basically  driver with a working
         test setup and ready to be tested and debugged.

  usbnsh:
  =======
    Description.
    ------------
    This is another NSH example.  If differs from the 'nsh' configuration
    above in that this configurations uses a USB serial device for console
    I/O.  This configuration was created to support the "DB-DP11212 PIC32
    General Purpose Demo Board" which has no easily accessible serial port.
    However, as of this writing, the configuration has set for the
    "DB_DP11215 PIC32 Storage Demo Board" and has only be testing on that
    board.

    Notes.
    -----
    1. By default, this configuration uses an older Microchip C32 toolchain
       for Windows (the newer ones seem to be incompatible) and builds under
       Cygwin (or probably MSYS).  That can easily be reconfigured, of course.

       Build Setup:
         CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y      : Builds under Windows
         CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y    : Using Cygwin

       System Type:
         CONFIG_MIPS32_TOOLCHAIN_MICROCHIPW_LITE=y : Older C32 toolchain

    2. Comparison to nsh

      Below summarizes the key configuration differences between the 'nsh'
      and the 'upnsh' configurations:

        CONFIG_USBDEV=y               : NuttX USB device support is enabled
        CONFIG_PIC32MX_USBDEV=y       : The PIC32MX USB device driver is built
        CONFIG_DEV_CONSOLE=n          : /dev/console does not exist on power up
        CONFIG_UART1_SERIAL_CONSOLE=n : There is no serial console
        CONFIG_UART2_SERIAL_CONSOLE=n :
        CONFIG_CDCACM=y               : The CDC/ACM serial device class is enabled
        CONFIG_CDCACM_CONSOLE=y       : The CDC/ACM serial device is the console

    3. Using the Prolifics PL2303 Emulation

      You could also use the non-standard PL2303 serial device instead of
      the standard CDC/ACM serial device by changing:

        Drivers->USB Device Driver Support
          CONFIG_CDCACM=n             : Disable the CDC/ACM serial device class
          CONFIG_CDCACM_CONSOLE=n     : The CDC/ACM serial device is NOT the console
          CONFIG_PL2303=y             : The Prolifics PL2303 emulation is enabled
          CONFIG_PL2303_CONSOLE=y     : The PL2303 serial device is the console

      Why would you want to use a non-standard USB serial driver?  You might
      to use the PL2303 driver with a Windows host because it should
      automatically install the PL2303 driver (you might have to go through
      some effort to get Windows to recognize the CDC/ACM device).

    4. Since this configuration is current set for the "DB_DP11215 PIC32
       Storage Demo Board," UART2 is available and is configured to used as
       the SYSLOG device.  That means that all debug output will be directed
       out UART2.  Debug output is not enabled by default, however, so these
       settings do nothing until you enable debug output.

        Device Drivers -> System Logging Device Options:
          CONFIG_SYSLOG_CHAR=y
          CONFIG_SYSLOG_DEVPATH="/dev/ttyS0"

        System Type -> PIC32MX Peripheral Support:
          CONFIG_PIC32MX_UART2=y      : Enable UART2

        Device Drivers -> Serial Driver Support:
          CONFIG_UART2_2STOP=0        : UART2 configuration
          CONFIG_UART2_BAUD=115200
          CONFIG_UART2_BITS=8
          CONFIG_UART2_PARITY=0
          CONFIG_UART2_RXBUFSIZE=64
          CONFIG_UART2_TXBUFSIZE=64

       NOTE:  Using the SYSLOG to get debug output has limitations.  Among
       those are that you cannot get debug output from interrupt handlers.
       So, in particularly, debug output is not a useful way to debug the
       USB device controller driver.  Instead, use the USB monitor with
       USB debug off and USB trance on (see below).

    5. Enabling USB monitor SYSLOG output.  If tracing is enabled, the USB
       device will save encoded trace output in in-memory buffer; if the
       USB monitor is enabled, that trace buffer will be periodically
       emptied and dumped to the system logging device (UART2 in this
       configuration):

        Device Drivers -> "USB Device Driver Support:
          CONFIG_USBDEV_TRACE=y                   : Enable USB trace feature
          CONFIG_USBDEV_TRACE_NRECORDS=256        : Buffer 256 records in memory

        Application Configuration -> NSH LIbrary:
          CONFIG_NSH_USBDEV_TRACE=n               : No builtin tracing from NSH
          CONFIG_NSH_ARCHINIT=y                   : Automatically start the USB monitor

        Application Configuration -> System NSH Add-Ons:
          CONFIG_USBMONITOR=y              : Enable the USB monitor daemon
          CONFIG_USBMONITOR_STACKSIZE=2048 : USB monitor daemon stack size
          CONFIG_USBMONITOR_PRIORITY=50    : USB monitor daemon priority
          CONFIG_USBMONITOR_INTERVAL=1     : Dump trace data every second
          CONFIG_USBMONITOR_TRACEINIT=y    : Enable TRACE output
          CONFIG_USBMONITOR_TRACECLASS=y
          CONFIG_USBMONITOR_TRACETRANSFERS=y
          CONFIG_USBMONITOR_TRACECONTROLLER=y
          CONFIG_USBMONITOR_TRACEINTERRUPTS=y

       NOTE: USB debug output also be enabled in this case.  Both will appear
       on the serial SYSLOG output.  However, the debug output will be
       asynchronous with the trace output and, hence, difficult to interpret.

    6. If you want to try this configuration on the DB-DP11212 PIC32 General
       Purpose Demo Board", here are the changes that you should make:

        Board Configuration:
           CONFIG_ARCH_DBDP11215=n    : Disable the DB-DP11215
           CONFIG_ARCH_DBDP11212=y    : Enable the DB-DP11212
           CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS=n         : The DB-DP11212 has no LEDs

        System Type -> PIC32MX Peripheral Support:
           CONFIG_PIC32MX_UART2=n     : Disable UART2

        The SYSLOG output on UART2 cannot by used.  You have two choices,
        first, you can simply disable the SYSLOG device.  Then 1) debug
        output will come the USB console, and 2) all debug output prior
        to connecting the USB console will be lost:

        The second options is to configure a RAM SYSLOG device.  This is
        a circular buffer that accumulated debug output in memory.  The
        contents of the circular buffer can be dumped from the NSH command
        line using the 'dmesg' command.

        Device Drivers -> System Logging Device Options:
          CONFIG_RAMLOG=y             : Enable the RAM-based logging feature.
          CONFIG_RAMLOG_SYSLOG=y      : This enables the RAM-based logger as the
                                        system logger.

        Logging is currently can be set up to use any amount of memory (here 8KB):

          CONFIG_RAMLOG_BUFSIZE=8192

        STATUS:
          2013-7-4:  This configuration was last verified.

     7. See the notes for the nsh configuration.  Most also apply to the usbnsh
        configuration as well.
