====================

This README file discusses the port of NuttX to the Sparkfun UBW32 board.
This port uses the original v2.5 board which is based on the MicroChip
PIC32MX460F512L.  See http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8971.  This older
version has been replaced with this board http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9713.

PIC32MX460F512L Pin Out
=======================

  PIC32MX460F512L 100-Pin TQFP (USB) Pin Out.  The mapping to the pins on
  the PCL Logic board are very simple, each pin is brought out to a connector
  label with the PIC32MX460F512L pin number.

  On board logic only manages power, crystal, and USB signals.

MAX3232 Connection
==================

  I use a tiny, MAX3232 board that I got from the eBay made by NKC
  Electronics (http://www.nkcelectronics.com/).  As of this writing, it
  is also available here: http://www.nkcelectronics.com/rs232-to-ttl-3v--55v-convert232356.html

  CTS -- Not connected
  RTS -- Not connected
  TX  -- J4 pin 31: U1TX/RF8

  GND -- J4 pin 40: GND
  Vcc -- J4 pin 39: 5V

Toolchains
==========

  MPLAB/C32
  ---------

  I am using the free, "Lite" version of the PIC32MX toolchain available
  for download from the microchip.com web site.  I am using the Windows
  version.  The MicroChip toolchain is the only toolchain currently
  supported in these configurations, but it should be a simple matter to
  adapt to other toolchains by modifying the Make.defs file include in
  each configuration.

  C32 Toolchain Options:

    CONFIG_MIPS32_TOOLCHAIN_MICROCHIPW      - MicroChip full toolchain for Windows
    CONFIG_MIPS32_TOOLCHAIN_MICROCHIPL      - MicroChip full toolchain for Linux
    CONFIG_MIPS32_TOOLCHAIN_MICROCHIPW_LITE - MicroChip "Lite" toolchain for Windows
    CONFIG_MIPS32_TOOLCHAIN_MICROCHIPL_LITE - MicroChip "Lite" toolchain for Linux
    CONFIG_MIPS32_TOOLCHAIN_PINGUINOL       - Pinquino toolchain for Linux
    CONFIG_MIPS32_TOOLCHAIN_PINGUINOW       - Pinquino toolchain for Windows
    CONFIG_MIPS32_TOOLCHAIN_MICROCHIPOPENL  - Microchip open toolchain for Linux
    CONFIG_MIPS32_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_ELF         - General mips-elf toolchain for Linux

  NOTE:  The "Lite" versions of the toolchain does not support C++.  Also
  certain optimization levels are not supported by the "Lite" toolchain.

  MicrochipOpen
  -------------

  An alternative, build-it-yourself toolchain is available here:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/microchipopen/ .  These tools were
  last updated circa 2010.  NOTE:  C++ support still not available
  in this toolchain.

  Building MicrochipOpen (on Linux)

  1) Get the build script from this location:

      http://microchipopen.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/microchipopen/ccompiler4pic32/buildscripts/trunk/

  2) Build the code using the build script, for example:

      ./build.sh -b v105_freeze

     This will check out the selected branch and build the tools.

  3) Binaries will then be available in a subdirectory with a name something like
     pic32-v105-freeze-20120622/install-image/bin (depending on the current data
     and the branch that you selected.

     Note that the tools will have the prefix, mypic32- so, for example, the
     compiler will be called mypic32-gcc.

  Pinguino mips-elf Toolchain
  ---------------------------

  Another option is the mips-elf toolchain used with the Pinguino project.  This
  is a relatively current mips-elf GCC and should provide free C++ support as
  well. This toolchain can be downloaded from the Pinguino website:
  http://wiki.pinguino.cc/index.php/Main_Page#Download .

  See also boards/mirtoo/README.txt.  There is an experimental (untested)
  configuration for the Mirtoo platform in that directory.

  MPLAB/C32 vs MPLABX/X32
  -----------------------

  It appears that Microchip is phasing out the MPLAB/C32 toolchain and replacing
  it with MPLABX and XC32.  At present, the XC32 toolchain is *not* compatible
  with the NuttX build scripts.  Here are some of the issues that I see when trying
  to build with XC32:

  1) Make.def changes:  You have to change the tool prefix:

     -CROSSDEV=pic32-
     +CROSSDEV=xc32-

  2) debug.ld/release.ld:  The like expect some things that are not present in
     the current linker scripts (or are expected with different names).  Here
     are some partial fixes:

     Rename:  kseg0_progmem to kseg0_program_mem
     Rename:  kseg1_datamem to kseg1_data_mem

  Even then, there are more warnings from the linker and some undefined symbols
  for non-NuttX code that resides in the unused Microchip libraries.  You will
  have to solve at least this undefined symbol problem if you want to used the
  XC32 toolchain.

  Windows Native Toolchains
  -------------------------

  NOTE:  There are several limitations to using a Windows based toolchain in a
  Cygwin environment.  The three biggest are:

  1. The Windows toolchain cannot follow Cygwin paths.  Path conversions are
     performed automatically in the Cygwin makefiles using the 'cygpath' utility
     but you might easily find some new path problems.  If so, check out 'cygpath -w'

  2. Windows toolchains cannot follow Cygwin symbolic links.  Many symbolic links
     are used in NuttX (e.g., include/arch).  The make system works around these
     problems for the Windows tools by copying directories instead of linking them.
     But this can also cause some confusion for you:  For example, you may edit
     a file in a "linked" directory and find that your changes had no effect.
     That is because you are building the copy of the file in the "fake" symbolic
     directory.  If you use a Windows toolchain, you should get in the habit of
     making like this:

       make clean_context all

     An alias in your .bashrc file might make that less painful.

Loading NuttX with PICkit2
==========================

  NOTE:  You need a PICKit3 if you plan to use the MPLAB debugger!  The PICKit2
  can, however, still be used to load programs.  Instructions for the PICKit3
  are similar.

  Intel Hex Forma Files:
  ----------------------

    When NuttX is built it will produce two files in the top-level NuttX
    directory:

    1) nuttx - This is an ELF file, and
    2) nuttx.hex - This is an Intel Hex format file.  This is controlled by
       the setting CONFIG_INTELHEX_BINARY in the .config file.

    The PICkit tool wants an Intel Hex format file to burn into FLASH. However,
    there is a problem with the generated nutt.hex: The tool expects the nuttx.hex
    file to contain physical addresses.  But the nuttx.hex file generated from the
    top-level make will have address in the KSEG0 and KSEG1 regions.

  tools/pic32/mkpichex:
  ----------------------

    There is a simple tool in the NuttX tools/pic32 directory that can be
    used to solve both issues with the nuttx.hex file.  But, first, you must
    build the tool:

      cd tools/pic32
      make -f Makefile.host

    Now you will have an executable file call mkpichex (or mkpichex.exe on
    Cygwin).  This program will take the nutt.hex file as an input, it will
    convert all of the KSEG0 and KSEG1 addresses to physical address, and
    it will write the modified file, replacing the original nuttx.hex.

    To use this file, you need to do the following things:

      export PATH =??? # Add the NuttX tools/pic32 directory to your
                       # PATH variable
      make             # Build nuttx and nuttx.hex
      mkpichex $PWD    # Convert addresses in nuttx.hex.  $PWD is the path
                       # to the top-level build directory.  It is the only
                       # required input to mkpichex.

      This procedure is automatically performed at the end of a build.

    CONFIG_UARTn_SERIAL_CONSOLE - selects the UARTn for the
       console and ttys0 (default is the UART0).
    CONFIG_UARTn_RXBUFSIZE - Characters are buffered as received.
       This specific the size of the receive buffer
    CONFIG_UARTn_TXBUFSIZE - Characters are buffered before
       being sent.  This specific the size of the transmit buffer
    CONFIG_UARTn_BAUD - The configure BAUD of the UART.  Must be
    CONFIG_UARTn_BITS - The number of bits.  Must be either 7 or 8.
    CONFIG_UARTn_PARTIY - 0=no parity, 1=odd parity, 2=even parity
    CONFIG_UARTn_2STOP - Two stop bits

  PIC32MXx USB Device Configuration

  PIC32MXx USB Host Configuration (the PIC32MX does not support USB Host)

Configurations
==============

Each PIC32MX configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and can be
selected as follow:

    tools/configure.sh ubw32:<subdir>

Where <subdir> is one of the following:

  nsh:

    This is the NuttShell (NSH) using the NSH startup logic at
    apps/examples/nsh.

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
       change this configurations using that tool, you should:

       a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
          see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

       b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.

    2. Serial Output

       The OS test produces all of its test output on the serial console.
       This configuration has UART1 enabled as a serial console.

       TX  -- J4 pin 31: U1TX/RF8
       RX  -- J4 pin 30: U1RX/RF2
       GND -- J4 pin 40: GND
       Vcc -- J4 pin 39: 5V

    3. USB Configurations

       Several USB device configurations can be enabled and included
       as NSH built-in built in functions.

       All USB device configurations require the following basic setup in
       your NuttX configuration file to enable USB device support:

         CONFIG_USBDEV=y         : Enable basic USB device support
         CONFIG_PIC32MX_USBDEV=y : Enable PIC32 USB device support

       system/cdcacm -  The system/cdcacm program can be included as an
       function by adding the  following to the NuttX configuration file:

         CONFIG_SYSTEM_CDCACM=y

       and defining the following in your .config file:

         CONFIG_CDCACM=y         : Enable the CDCACM device
