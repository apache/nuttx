  - 7 modules are capable of DMA operations.

ESP32-H2 Toolchain
==================

A generic RISC-V toolchain can be used to build ESP32-H2 projects. It's recommended to use the same
toolchain used by NuttX CI. Please refer to the Docker
`container <https://github.com/apache/nuttx/tree/master/tools/ci/docker/linux/Dockerfile>`_ and
check for the current compiler version being used. For instance:

.. code-block::

   ###############################################################################
   # Build image for tool required by RISCV builds
   ###############################################################################
   FROM nuttx-toolchain-base AS nuttx-toolchain-riscv
   # Download the latest RISCV GCC toolchain prebuilt by xPack
   RUN mkdir riscv-none-elf-gcc && \
   curl -s -L "https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-elf-gcc-xpack/releases/download/v12.3.0-2/xpack-riscv-none-elf-gcc-12.3.0-2-linux-x64.tar.gz" \
   | tar -C riscv-none-elf-gcc --strip-components 1 -xz

It uses the xPack's prebuilt toolchain based on GCC 12.3.0.

Installing
----------

First, create a directory to hold the toolchain:

.. code-block:: console

   $ mkdir -p /path/to/your/toolchain/riscv-none-elf-gcc

Download and extract toolchain:

.. code-block:: console

   $ curl -s -L "https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-elf-gcc-xpack/releases/download/v12.3.0-2/xpack-riscv-none-elf-gcc-12.3.0-2-linux-x64.tar.gz" \
   | tar -C /path/to/your/toolchain/riscv-none-elf-gcc --strip-components 1 -xz

Add the toolchain to your `PATH`:

.. code-block:: console

   $ echo "export PATH=/path/to/your/toolchain/riscv-none-elf-gcc/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc

You can edit your shell's rc files if you don't use bash.

Second stage bootloader and partition table
===========================================

The NuttX port for now relies on IDF's second stage bootloader to carry on some hardware
initializations.  The binaries for the bootloader and the partition table can be found in
this repository: https://github.com/espressif/esp-nuttx-bootloader
That repository contains a dummy IDF project that's used to build the bootloader and
partition table, these are then presented as Github assets and can be downloaded
from: https://github.com/espressif/esp-nuttx-bootloader/releases
Download ``bootloader-esp32h2.bin`` and ``partition-table-esp32h2.bin`` and place them
in a folder, the path to this folder will be used later to program them. This
can be: ``../esp-bins``

Building and flashing
=====================

First make sure that ``esptool.py`` is installed.  This tool is used to convert
the ELF to a compatible ESP32-H2 image and to flash the image into the board.
It can be installed with: ``pip install esptool``.

Configure the NuttX project: ``./tools/configure.sh esp32h2-devkit:nsh``
Run ``make`` to build the project.  Note that the conversion mentioned above is
included in the build process.
The ``esptool.py`` command to flash all the binaries is::

     esptool.py --chip esp32h2 --port /dev/ttyUSBXX --baud 921600 write_flash 0x0 bootloader.bin 0x8000 partition-table.bin 0x10000 nuttx.bin

However, this is also included in the build process and we can build and flash with::

   make flash ESPTOOL_PORT=<port> ESPTOOL_BINDIR=../esp-bins

Where ``<port>`` is typically ``/dev/ttyUSB0`` or similar and ``../esp-bins`` is
the path to the folder containing the bootloader and the partition table
for the ESP32-H2 as explained above.
Note that this step is required only one time.  Once the bootloader and partition
table are flashed, we don't need to flash them again.  So subsequent builds
would just require: ``make flash ESPTOOL_PORT=/dev/ttyUSBXX``

Debugging with OpenOCD
======================

Download and build OpenOCD from Espressif, that can be found in
https://github.com/espressif/openocd-esp32

You don not need an external JTAG is to debug, the ESP32-H2 integrates a
USB-to-JTAG adapter.

OpenOCD can then be used::

   openocd -c 'set ESP_RTOS none' -f board/esp32h2-builtin.cfg

If you want to debug with an external JTAG adapter it can
be connected as follows::

  TMS -> GPIO2
  TDI -> GPIO5
  TCK -> GPIO5
  TDO -> GPIO3

Furthermore, an efuse needs to be burnt to be able to debug::

  espefuse.py -p <port> burn_efuse DIS_USB_JTAG

OpenOCD can then be used::

  openocd  -c 'set ESP_RTOS none' -f board/esp32h2-ftdi.cfg
