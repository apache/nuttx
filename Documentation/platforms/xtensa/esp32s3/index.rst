==================
Espressif ESP32-S3
==================

The ESP32-S3 is a series of single and dual-core SoCs from Espressif
based on Harvard architecture Xtensa LX7 CPUs and with on-chip support
for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

All embedded memory, external memory and peripherals are located on the
data bus and/or the instruction bus of these CPUs. With some minor
exceptions, the address mapping of two CPUs is symmetric, meaning they
use the same addresses to access the same memory. Multiple peripherals in
the system can access embedded memory via DMA.

On dual-core SoCs, the two CPUs are typically named "PRO_CPU" and "APP_CPU"
(for "protocol" and "application"), however for most purposes the
two CPUs are interchangeable.

ESP32-S3 Toolchain
==================

The toolchain used to build ESP32-S3 firmware can be either downloaded or built from the sources.

It is **highly** recommended to use (download or build) the same toolchain version that is being
used by the NuttX CI.

Please refer to the Docker
`container <https://github.com/apache/nuttx/tree/master/tools/ci/docker/linux/Dockerfile>`_ and
check for the current compiler version being used. For instance:

.. code-block::

  ###############################################################################
  # Build image for tool required by ESP32 builds
  ###############################################################################
  FROM nuttx-toolchain-base AS nuttx-toolchain-esp32
  # Download the latest ESP32, ESP32-S2 and ESP32-S3 GCC toolchain prebuilt by Espressif
  RUN mkdir -p xtensa-esp-elf-gcc && \
    curl -s -L "https://github.com/espressif/crosstool-NG/releases/download/esp-14.2.0_20241119/xtensa-esp-elf-14.2.0_20241119-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.xz" \
    | tar -C xtensa-esp-elf-gcc --strip-components 1 -xJ

For ESP32-S3, the toolchain version is based on GGC 14.2.0 (``xtensa-esp-elf-14.2.0_20241119``)

The prebuilt Toolchain (Recommended)
------------------------------------

First, create a directory to hold the toolchain:

.. code-block:: console

  $ mkdir -p /path/to/your/toolchain/xtensa-esp-elf-gcc

Download and extract toolchain:

.. code-block:: console

  $ curl -s -L "https://github.com/espressif/crosstool-NG/releases/download/esp-14.2.0_20241119/xtensa-esp-elf-14.2.0_20241119-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.xz" \
  | tar -C xtensa-esp-elf-gcc --strip-components 1 -xJ

Add the toolchain to your `PATH`:

.. code-block:: console

  $ echo "export PATH=/path/to/your/toolchain/xtensa-esp-elf-gcc/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc

You can edit your shell's rc files if you don't use bash.

Building from source
--------------------

You can also build the toolchain yourself. The steps to
build the toolchain with crosstool-NG on Linux are as follows

.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone https://github.com/espressif/crosstool-NG.git
  $ cd crosstool-NG
  $ git submodule update --init

  $ ./bootstrap && ./configure --enable-local && make

  $ ./ct-ng xtensa-esp32s3-elf
  $ ./ct-ng build

  $ chmod -R u+w builds/xtensa-esp32s3-elf

  $ export PATH="crosstool-NG/builds/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin:$PATH"

These steps are given in the setup guide in
`ESP-IDF documentation <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/linux-setup-scratch.html>`_.

Building and flashing NuttX
===========================

Installing esptool
------------------

First, make sure that ``esptool.py`` is installed and up-to-date.
This tool is used to convert the ELF to a compatible ESP32-S3 image and to flash the image into the board.

It can be installed with: ``pip install esptool>=4.8.1``.

.. warning::
    Installing ``esptool.py`` may required a Python virtual environment on newer systems.
    This will be the case if the ``pip install`` command throws an error such as:
    ``error: externally-managed-environment``.

    If you are not familiar with virtual environments, refer to `Managing esptool on virtual environment`_ for instructions on how to install ``esptool.py``.

Bootloader and partitions
-------------------------

NuttX can boot the ESP32-S3 directly using the so-called "Simple Boot". An externally-built
2nd stage bootloader is not required in this case as all functions required to boot the device
are built within NuttX. Simple boot does not require any specific configuration (it is selectable
by default if no other 2nd stage bootloader is used).

If other features are required, an externally-built 2nd stage bootloader is needed. The bootloader
is built using the ``make bootloader`` command. This command generates the firmware in the
``nuttx`` folder. The ``ESPTOOL_BINDIR`` is used in the ``make flash`` command to specify the path
to the bootloader. For compatibility among other SoCs and future options of 2nd stage bootloaders,
the commands ``make bootloader`` and the ``ESPTOOL_BINDIR`` option (for the ``make flash``) can be
used even if no externally-built 2nd stage bootloader is being built (they will be ignored if
Simple Boot is used, for instance)::

  $ make bootloader

.. note:: It is recommended that if this is the first time you are using the board with NuttX to
   perform a complete SPI FLASH erase.

    .. code-block:: console

      $ esptool.py erase_flash

Building and Flashing
---------------------

This is a two-step process where the first step converts the ELF file into an ESP32-S3 compatible binary
and the second step flashes it to the board. These steps are included in the build system and it is
possible to build and flash the NuttX firmware simply by running::

    $ make flash ESPTOOL_PORT=<port> ESPTOOL_BINDIR=./

where:

* ``ESPTOOL_PORT`` is typically ``/dev/ttyUSB0`` or similar.
* ``ESPTOOL_BINDIR=./`` is the path of the externally-built 2nd stage bootloader and the partition table (if applicable): when built using the ``make bootloader``, these files are placed into ``nuttx`` folder.
* ``ESPTOOL_BAUD`` is able to change the flash baud rate if desired.

Flashing NSH Example
--------------------

This example shows how to build and flash the ``nsh`` defconfig for the ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 board::

    $ cd nuttx
    $ make distclean
    $ ./tools/configure.sh esp32s3-devkit:nsh
    $ make -j$(nproc)

When the build is complete, the firmware can be flashed to the board using the command::

    $ make -j$(nproc) flash ESPTOOL_PORT=<port> ESPTOOL_BINDIR=./

where ``<port>`` is the serial port where the board is connected::

  $ make flash ESPTOOL_PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0 ESPTOOL_BINDIR=./
  CP: nuttx.hex
  MKIMAGE: ESP32-S3 binary
  esptool.py -c esp32s3 elf2image --ram-only-header -fs 4MB -fm dio -ff 40m -o nuttx.bin nuttx
  esptool.py v4.8.1
  Creating esp32s3 image...

Debugging
=========

This section describes debugging techniques for the ESP32-S3.

Debugging with ``openocd`` and ``gdb``
--------------------------------------

Espressif uses a specific version of OpenOCD to support ESP32-S3: `openocd-esp32 <https://github.com/espressif/>`_.

Please check `Building OpenOCD from Sources <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v5.1/esp32s3/api-guides/jtag-debugging/index.html#jtag-debugging-building-openocd>`_
for more information on how to build OpenOCD for ESP32-S3.

The quickest and most convenient way to start with JTAG debugging is through a USB cable
connected to the D+/D- USB pins of ESP32-S3. No need for an external JTAG adapter and
extra wiring/cable to connect JTAG to ESP32-S3. Most of the ESP32-S3 boards have a
USB connector that can be used for JTAG debugging.
This is the case for the :ref:`ESP32-S3-DevKit <platforms/xtensa/esp32s3/boards/esp32s3-devkit/index:ESP32S3-DevKit>` board.

.. note:: One must configure the USB drivers to enable JTAG communication. Please check
  `Configure USB Drivers <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v5.1/esp32s3/api-guides/jtag-debugging/configure-builtin-jtag.html?highlight=udev#configure-usb-drivers>`_
  for more information.

OpenOCD can then be used::

  openocd -s <tcl_scripts_path> -c 'set ESP_RTOS hwthread' -f board/esp32s3-builtin.cfg -c 'init; reset halt; esp appimage_offset 0x0'

.. note::
  - ``appimage_offset`` should be set to ``0x0`` when ``Simple Boot`` is used. For MCUboot, this value should be set to
    ``CONFIG_ESP32S3_OTA_PRIMARY_SLOT_OFFSET`` value (``0x10000`` by default).
  - ``-s <tcl_scripts_path>`` defines the path to the OpenOCD scripts. Usually set to `tcl` if running openocd from its source directory.
    It can be omitted if `openocd-esp32` were installed in the system with `sudo make install`.

Once OpenOCD is running, you can use GDB to connect to it and debug your application::

  xtensa-esp32s3-elf-gdb -x gdbinit nuttx

whereas the content of the ``gdbinit`` file is::

  target remote :3333
  set remote hardware-watchpoint-limit 2
  mon reset halt
  flushregs
  monitor reset halt
  thb nsh_main
  c

.. note:: ``nuttx`` is the ELF file generated by the build process. Please note that ``CONFIG_DEBUG_SYMBOLS`` must be enabled in the ``menuconfig``.

Please refer to :doc:`/quickstart/debugging` for more information about debugging techniques.

Stack Dump and Backtrace Dump
-----------------------------

NuttX has a feature to dump the stack of a task and to dump the backtrace of it (and of all
the other tasks). This feature is useful to debug the system when it is not behaving as expected,
especially when it is crashing.

In order to enable this feature, the following options must be enabled in the NuttX configuration:
``CONFIG_SCHED_BACKTRACE``, ``CONFIG_DEBUG_SYMBOLS`` and, optionally, ``CONFIG_ALLSYMS``.

.. note::
   The first two options enable the backtrace dump. The third option enables the backtrace dump
   with the associated symbols, but increases the size of the generated NuttX binary.

Espressif also provides a tool to translate the backtrace dump into a human-readable format.
This tool is called ``btdecode.sh`` and is available at ``tools/espressif/btdecode.sh`` of NuttX
repository.

.. note::
   This tool is not necessary if ``CONFIG_ALLSYMS`` is enabled. In this case, the backtrace dump
   contains the function names.

Example - Crash Dump
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A typical crash dump, caused by an illegal load with ``CONFIG_SCHED_BACKTRACE`` and
``CONFIG_DEBUG_SYMBOLS`` enabled, is shown below::

Using QEMU
==========

Get or build QEMU from `here <https://github.com/espressif/qemu/wiki>`__. The minimum supported version is 9.0.0.

Enable the ``ESP32S3_QEMU_IMAGE`` config found in :menuselection:`Board Selection --> ESP32S3 binary image for QEMU`.

Build and generate the QEMU image::

 $ make bootloader
 $ make ESPTOOL_BINDIR=.

A QEMU-compatible ``nuttx.merged.bin`` binary image will be created. It can be run as::

 $ qemu-system-xtensa -nographic -machine esp32s3 -drive file=nuttx.merged.bin,if=mtd,format=raw

QEMU Networking
---------------

Networking is possible using the openeth MAC driver. Enable ``ESP32S3_OPENETH`` option and set the nic in QEMU:

 $ qemu-system-xtensa -nographic -machine esp32s3 -drive file=nuttx.merged.bin,if=mtd,format=raw -nic user,model=open_eth

Analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
---------------------------------

Two ADC units are available for the ESP32-S3, each with 10 channels.

Those units are independent and can be used simultaneously. During bringup, GPIOs for selected channels are
configured automatically to be used as ADC inputs.
If available, ADC calibration is automatically applied (see
`this page <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.1/esp32s3/api-reference/peripherals/adc_calibration.html>`__ for more details).
Otherwise, a simple conversion is applied based on the attenuation and resolution.

Each ADC unit is accessible using the ADC character driver, which returns data for the enabled channels.

The ADC unit can be enabled in the menu :menuselection:`System Type --> ESP32-S3 Peripheral Selection --> Analog-to-digital converter (ADC)`.

Then, it can be customized in the menu :menuselection:`System Type --> ADC Configuration`, which includes operating mode, gain and channels.

.. _MCUBoot and OTA Update S3:

MCUBoot and OTA Update
======================

The ESP32-S3 supports over-the-air (OTA) updates using MCUBoot.

Read more about the MCUBoot for Espressif devices `here <https://docs.mcuboot.com/readme-espressif.html>`__.

Executing OTA Update
--------------------

This section describes how to execute OTA update using MCUBoot.

1. First build the default ``mcuboot_update_agent`` config. This image defaults to the primary slot and already comes with Wi-Fi settings enabled::

    ./tools/configure.sh esp32s3-devkit:mcuboot_update_agent

2. Build the MCUBoot bootloader::

    make bootloader

3. Finally, build the application image::

    make

Flash the image to the board and verify it boots ok.
It should show the message "This is MCUBoot Update Agent image" before NuttShell is ready.

At this point, the board should be able to connect to Wi-Fi so we can download a new binary from our network::

  NuttShell (NSH) NuttX-12.4.0
  This is MCUBoot Update Agent image
  nsh>
  nsh> wapi psk wlan0 <wifi_ssid> 3
  nsh> wapi essid wlan0 <wifi_password> 1
  nsh> renew wlan0

Now, keep the board as is and execute the following commands to **change the MCUBoot target slot to the 2nd slot**
and modify the message of the day (MOTD) as a mean to verify the new image is being used.

1. Change the MCUBoot target slot to the 2nd slot::

    kconfig-tweak -d CONFIG_ESPRESSIF_ESPTOOL_TARGET_PRIMARY
    kconfig-tweak -e CONFIG_ESPRESSIF_ESPTOOL_TARGET_SECONDARY
    kconfig-tweak --set-str CONFIG_NSH_MOTD_STRING "This is MCUBoot UPDATED image!"
    make olddefconfig

  .. note::
    The same changes can be accomplished through ``menuconfig`` in :menuselection:`System Type --> Bootloader and Image Configuration --> Target slot for image flashing`
    for MCUBoot target slot and in :menuselection:`System Type --> Bootloader and Image Configuration --> Search (motd) --> NSH Library --> Message of the Day` for the MOTD.

2. Rebuild the application image::

    make

At this point the board is already connected to Wi-Fi and has the primary image flashed.
The new image configured for the 2nd slot is ready to be downloaded.

To execute OTA, create a simple HTTP server on the NuttX directory so we can access the binary remotely::

  cd nuttxspace/nuttx
  python3 -m http.server
   Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...

On the board, execute the update agent, setting the IP address to the one on the host machine. Wait until image is transferred and the board should reboot automatically::

  nsh> mcuboot_agent http://10.42.0.1:8000/nuttx.bin
  MCUboot Update Agent example
  Downloading from http://10.42.0.1:8000/nuttx.bin
  Firmware Update size: 1048576 bytes
  Received: 512      of 1048576 bytes [0%]
  Received: 1024     of 1048576 bytes [0%]
  Received: 1536     of 1048576 bytes [0%]
  [.....]
  Received: 1048576  of 1048576 bytes [100%]
  Application Image successfully downloaded!
  Requested update for next boot. Restarting...

NuttShell should now show the new MOTD, meaning the new image is being used::

  NuttShell (NSH) NuttX-12.4.0
  This is MCUBoot UPDATED image!
  nsh>

Finally, the image is loaded but not confirmed.
To make sure it won't rollback to the previous image, you must confirm with ``mcuboot_confirm`` and reboot the board.
The OTA is now complete.

Flash Allocation for MCUBoot
----------------------------

When MCUBoot is enabled on ESP32-S3, the flash memory is organized as follows
based on the default KConfig values:

**Flash Layout (MCUBoot Enabled)**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 20 20

**Note**: The E-Fuse Virtual region is optional and only used when
``ESPRESSIF_EFUSE_VIRTUAL_KEEP_IN_FLASH`` is enabled. However, this 64KB
location is always allocated in the memory layout to prevent accidental
erasure during board flashing operations, ensuring data preservation if
virtual E-Fuses are later enabled.

For MCUBoot operation:

- The **Primary Slot** contains the currently running application
- The **Secondary Slot** receives OTA updates
- The **Scratch Partition** is used by MCUBoot for image swapping during updates
- MCUBoot manages image validation, confirmation, and rollback functionality

Wi-Fi
=====

.. tip:: Boards usually expose a ``wifi`` defconfig which enables Wi-Fi. On ESP32-S3,
   SMP is enabled to enhance Wi-Fi performance.

A standard network interface will be configured and can be initialized such as::

    nsh> ifup wlan0
    nsh> wapi psk wlan0 mypasswd 3
    nsh> wapi essid wlan0 myssid 1
    nsh> renew wlan0

In this case a connection to AP with SSID ``myssid`` is done, using ``mypasswd`` as
password. IP address is obtained via DHCP using ``renew`` command. You can check
the result by running ``ifconfig`` afterwards.

.. tip:: Please refer to :ref:`ESP32 Wi-Fi Station Mode <esp32_wi-fi_sta>`
  for more information.

Wi-Fi SoftAP
------------

It is possible to use ESP32-S3 as an Access Point (SoftAP).

.. tip:: Boards usually expose a ``sta_softap`` defconfig which enables Wi-Fi
   (STA + SoftAP). On ESP32-S3, SMP is enabled to enhance Wi-Fi performance.

If you are using this board config profile you can run these commands to be able
to connect your smartphone or laptop to your board::

    nsh> ifup wlan1
    nsh> dhcpd_start wlan1
    nsh> wapi psk wlan1 mypasswd 3
    nsh> wapi essid wlan1 nuttxap 1

In this case, you are creating the access point ``nuttxapp`` in your board and to
connect to it on your smartphone you will be required to type the password ``mypasswd``
using WPA2.

.. tip:: Please refer to :ref:`ESP32 Wi-Fi SoftAP Mode <esp32_wi-fi_softap>`
  for more information.

The ``dhcpd_start`` is necessary to let your board to associate an IP to your smartphone.

Power Management
================

.. tip:: Boards usually expose a pm defconfig which enables power management
  features. On ESP32-S3, different low power modes can be used to reduce power
  consumption depending on the application.

When using this board configuration profile, two wakeup sources are available:

- Timer (mandatory) : Every time the board enters sleep mode, a timer is started. Once the defined time is reached, the board wakes up.
- EXT1 (optional): The board wakes up whenever the selected EXT1 GPIO is asserted to the configured level.

PSRAM
-----

The external PSRAM is supported in ESP32-S3. The PSRAM is mapped to the data bus during
the boot process. The PSRAM is used as a heap memory and is available for the application.

Please check the following examples for more information:

* :ref:`esp32s3-devkit:psram_octal <platforms/xtensa/esp32s3/boards/esp32s3-devkit/index:psram_octal>`
* :ref:`esp32s3-devkit:psram_quad <platforms/xtensa/esp32s3/boards/esp32s3-devkit/index:psram_quad>`

Moving not initialized data to the external PSRAM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Static or global not-initialized data can be moved to the external PSRAM. Usually allocated at the
``.bss`` memory segment, this data can be set to another section in the external PSRAM.
Set the attribute ``__attribute__ ((section (".ext_ram.bss")))`` to the variable. For example::

  __attribute__ ((section (".ext_ram.bss"))) static uint8_t my_data[1024];

``my_data`` will be allocated in the external PSRAM and can be explicitly initialized on runtime.

This is particularly useful when the internal RAM is not enough to hold all the data.

.. _esp32s3_ulp:

ULP RISC-V Coprocessor
======================

The ULP RISC-V core is a 32-bit coprocessor integrated into the ESP32-S3 SoC.
It is designed to run independently of the main high-performance (HP) core and is capable of executing lightweight tasks
such as GPIO polling, simple peripheral control and I/O interactions.

This coprocessor benefits to offload simple tasks from HP core (e.g., GPIO polling , I2C operations, basic control logic) and
frees the main CPU for higher-level processing

For more information about ULP RISC-V Coprocessor `check here <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32s3/api-reference/system/ulp-risc-v.html>`__.

Features of the ULP RISC-V Coprocessor
--------------------------------------

* Processor Architecture
   - RV32IMC RISC-V core — Integer (I), Multiplication/Division (M), and Compressed (C) instructions
   - Runs at 17.5 MHz
* Memory
   - Access to 8 KB of RTC slow memory (RTC_SLOW_MEM) memory region, and registers in RTC_CNTL, RTC_IO, and SARADC peripherals
* Debugging
   - Logging via bit-banged UART
   - Shared memory for state inspection
   - Panic or exception handlers can trigger wake-up or signal to main CPU if main CPU is in sleep
* Peripheral support
   - RTC domain peripherals (RTC GPIO, RTC I2C, ADC)

Loading Binary into ULP RISC-V Coprocessor
------------------------------------------

There are two ways to load a binary into LP-Core:
  - Using a prebuilt binary
  - Using NuttX internal build system to build your own (bare-metal) application

When using a prebuilt binary, the already compiled output for the ULP system whether built from NuttX
or the ESP-IDF environment can be leveraged. However, whenever the ULP code needs to be modified, it must be rebuilt separately,
and the resulting .bin file has to be integrated into NuttX. This workflow, while compatible, can become tedious.

With NuttX internal build system, the ULP binary code can be built and flashed from a single location. It is more convenient but
using build system has some dependencies on example side.

Both methods requires ``CONFIG_ESP32S3_ULP_COPROC_ENABLED`` and ``CONFIG_ESP32S3_ULP_COPROC_RESERVE_MEM`` variables to enable ULP RISC-V core.
These variables can be set using ``make menuconfig`` or ``kconfig-tweak`` commands.

Additionally, a Makefile needs to be provided to specify the ULP application name,
source path of the ULP application, and either the binary (for prebuilt) or the source files (for internal build).
This Makefile must include the ULP makefile after the variable set process on ``arch/xtensa/src/common/espressif/esp_ulp.mk`` integration script.
For more information please refer to :ref:`ulp example Makefile. <ulp_makefile>`

Makefile Variables for ULP RISC-V Core Build:
---------------------------------------------

- ``ULP_APP_NAME``: Sets name for the ULP RISC-V application. This variable also be used as prefix (e.g. ULP RISC-V application bin variable name)
- ``ULP_APP_FOLDER``: Specifies the directory containing the ULP RISC-V application's source codes.
- ``ULP_APP_BIN``: Defines the path of the prebuilt ULP RISC-V binary.
- ``ULP_APP_C_SRCS``: Lists all C source files (.c) that need to be compiled for the ULP RISC-V application.
- ``ULP_APP_ASM_SRCS``: Lists all assembly source files (.S or .s) to be assembled.
- ``ULP_APP_INCLUDES``: Specifies additional include directories for the compiler and assembler.

Here is an Makefile example when using prebuilt binary for ULP RISC-V core:

.. code-block:: console

   ULP_APP_NAME = esp_ulp
   ULP_APP_FOLDER = $(TOPDIR)$(DELIM)arch$(DELIM)$(CONFIG_ARCH)$(DELIM)src$(DELIM)$(CHIP_SERIES)
   ULP_APP_BIN = $(TOPDIR)$(DELIM)Documentation$(DELIM)platforms$(DELIM)$(CONFIG_ARCH)$(DELIM)$(CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP)$(DELIM)boards$(DELIM)$(CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD)$(DELIM)ulp_riscv_blink.bin

   include $(TOPDIR)$(DELIM)arch$(DELIM)$(CONFIG_ARCH)$(DELIM)src$(DELIM)common$(DELIM)espressif$(DELIM)esp_ulp.mk


Here is an example for enabling ULP and using the prebuilt test binary for ULP RISC-V core::

    make distclean
    ./tools/configure.sh esp32s3-devkit:nsh
    kconfig-tweak -e CONFIG_ESP32S3_ULP_COPROC_ENABLED
    kconfig-tweak --set-val CONFIG_ESP32S3_ULP_COPROC_RESERVE_MEM 8176
    kconfig-tweak -e CONFIG_ESPRESSIF_ULP_USE_TEST_BIN
    make olddefconfig
    make -j

Creating an ULP RISC-V Coprocessor Application
----------------------------------------------

To use NuttX's internal build system to compile the bare-metal ULP RISC-V Coprocessor binary, check the following instructions.

First, create a folder for the ULP source and header files into your NuttX example.
This folder is just for ULP project and it is an independent project. Therefore, the NuttX example guide should not be followed
for ULP example (folder location is irrelevant. It can be the same of the `nuttx-apps` repository, for instance).
To include the ULP folder in the build system, don't forget to include the ULP Makefile in the NuttX example Makefile. Lastly, configuration variables
needed to enable ULP core instructions can be found above.

NuttX's internal functions or POSIX calls are not supported.

Here is an example:

- ULP UART Snippet:

.. code-block:: C

  #include "ulp_riscv.h"
  #include "ulp_riscv_utils.h"
  #include "ulp_riscv_print.h"
  #include "ulp_riscv_uart_ulp_core.h"
  #include "sdkconfig.h"

  static ulp_riscv_uart_t s_print_uart;

  int main (void)
  {
    ulp_riscv_uart_cfg_t cfg = {
        .tx_pin = 0,
    };
    ulp_riscv_uart_init(&s_print_uart, &cfg);
    ulp_riscv_print_install((putc_fn_t)ulp_riscv_uart_putc, &s_print_uart);

    while(1)
    {
      ulp_riscv_print_str("Hello from the LP core!!\r\n");
      ulp_riscv_delay_cycles(1000 * ULP_RISCV_CYCLES_PER_MS);
    }

    return 0;
  }

For more information about ULP RISC-V Coprocessor examples `check here <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/system/ulp/lp_core>`__.
After these settings follow the same steps as for any other configuration to build NuttX. Build system checks ULP project path,
adds every source and header file into project and builds it.

To sum up, here is an example. ``ulp_example/ulp (../ulp_example/ulp)`` folder selected as example
to create a subfolder for ULP but folder that includes ULP source code can be anywhere. For more information about
custom apps, please follow NuttX `Custom Apps How-to <https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/guides/customapps.html#custom-apps-how-to>`__ guide,
this example will demonstrate how to add ULP code into a custom application:

    make distclean
    ./tools/configure.sh esp32s3-devkitc:nsh
    kconfig-tweak -e CONFIG_ESP32S3_ULP_COPROC_ENABLED
    kconfig-tweak --set-val CONFIG_ESP32S3_ULP_COPROC_RESERVE_MEM 8176
    kconfig-tweak -e CONFIG_DEV_GPIO
    kconfig-tweak -e CONFIG_EXAMPLES_ULP_EXAMPLE
    make olddefconfig
    make -j

Here is an example of a single ULP application. However, support is not limited to just 
one application. Multiple ULP applications are also supported.
By following the same guideline, multiple ULP applications can be created and loaded using ``write`` POSIX call.
Each NuttX application can build one ULP application. Therefore, to build multiple ULP applications, multiple NuttX
applications are needed to create each ULP binary. This limitation only applies when using the NuttX build system to
build multiple ULP applications; it does not affect the ability to load multiple ULP applications built by other means.

ULP binary can be included in NuttX application by adding
``#include "ulp/ulp/ulp_code.h"`` line. Then, the ULP binary is accessible by using the ULP application
prefix (defined by the ``ULP_APP_NAME`` variable in the ULP application Makefile) with the ``bin`` keyword to
access the binary data (e.g., if ``ULP_APP_NAME`` is ``ulp_test``, the binary variable will be ``ulp_test_bin``)
and ``bin_len`` keyword to access its length (e.g., ``ulp_test_bin_len`` for ``ULP_APP_NAME`` is ``ulp_test``).

Accessing the ULP RISC-V Coprocessor Program Variables
------------------------------------------------------

Global symbols defined in the ULP application are available to the HP core through a shared memory region. To read or write ULP variables,
direct reading/writing to such memory positions are not allowed. POSIX calls are needed instead. To access the ULP variable through the HP core,
consider that its name is defined by the ULP application prefix (defined by the ``ULP_APP_NAME`` variable in the ULP application Makefile) + the ULP application variable.
For example if HP core tries to access a ULP application variable named ``result`` and ``ULP_APP_NAME`` in the ULP application Makefile set as ``ulp_app``, required name for
that variable will be ``ulp_app_result``.
``FIONREAD`` or ``FIONWRITE`` ioctl calls are, then, performed with the address of a ``struct symtab_s`` previously defined with the name of the variable to be read or written.

.. warning::
  Ensure that the related ULP application is running. Otherwise, another ULP application may interfere by using the same memory space for a different variables.

Here is a snippet for reading and writing to a ULP variable named ``var_test`` (assuming the ``ULP_APP_NAME`` is set to ``ulp``) through the HP core:

.. code-block:: C

   #include <nuttx/config.h>
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <fcntl.h>
   #include <unistd.h>
   #include <sys/ioctl.h>
   #include "nuttx/symtab.h"

   int main (void)
    {
      uint32_t ulp_var;
      int fd;
      struct symtab_s sym =
      {
        .sym_name = "ulp_var_test",
        .sym_value = &ulp_var,
      };
      fd = open("/dev/ulp", O_RDWR);
      ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &sym);
      if (ulp_var != 0)
        {
          ulp_var = 0;
          ioctl(fd, FIONWRITE, &sym);
        }

      return OK;
    }

_`Managing esptool on virtual environment`
==========================================

This section describes how to install ``esptool``, ``imgtool`` or any other Python packages in a
proper environment.

Normally, a Linux-based OS would already have Python 3 installed by default. Up to a few years ago,
you could simply call ``pip install`` to install packages globally. However, this is no longer recommended
as it can lead to conflicts between packages and versions. The recommended way to install Python packages
is to use a virtual environment.

A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation for a particular
version of Python, plus a number of additional packages. You can create a virtual environment for each
project you are working on, and install the required packages in that environment.

Two alternatives are explained below, you can select any one of those.

Using pipx (recommended)
------------------------

``pipx`` is a tool that makes it easy to install Python packages in a virtual environment. To install
``pipx``, you can run the following command (using apt as example)::

    $ apt install pipx

Once you have installed ``pipx``, you can use it to install Python packages in a virtual environment. For
example, to install the ``esptool`` package, you can run the following command::

    $ pipx install esptool

This will create a new virtual environment in the ``~/.local/pipx/venvs`` directory, which contains the
``esptool`` package. You can now use the ``esptool`` command as normal, and so will the build system.

Make sure to run ``pipx ensurepath`` to add the ``~/.local/bin`` directory to your ``PATH``. This will
allow you to run the ``esptool`` command from any directory.

Using venv (alternative)
------------------------
To create a virtual environment, you can use the ``venv`` module, which is included in the Python standard
library. To create a virtual environment, you can run the following command::

    $ python3 -m venv myenv

This will create a new directory called ``myenv`` in the current directory, which contains a Python
installation and a copy of the Python standard library. To activate the virtual environment, you can run
the following command::

    $ source myenv/bin/activate

This will change your shell prompt to indicate that you are now working in the virtual environment. You can
now install packages using ``pip``. For example, to install the ``esptool`` package, you can run the following
command::

    $ pip install esptool

This will install the ``esptool`` package in the virtual environment. You can now use the ``esptool`` command as
normal. When you are finished working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by running the following
command::

    $ deactivate

This will return your shell prompt to its normal state. You can reactivate the virtual environment at any time by
running the ``source myenv/bin/activate`` command again. You can also delete the virtual environment by deleting
the directory that contains it.
