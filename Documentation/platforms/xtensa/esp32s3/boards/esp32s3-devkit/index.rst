Features
========

  - ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 Module
  - USB-to-UART bridge via micro USB port
  - Power LED
  - EN and BOOT buttons (BOOT accessible to user)
  - SPI FLASH (size varies according to model

Serial Console
==============

UART0 is, by default, the serial console.  It connects to the on-board
CP2102 converter and is available on the USB connector USB CON8 (J1).

It will show up as /dev/ttyUSB[n] where [n] will probably be 0.

Buttons and LEDs
================

Board Buttons
-------------

There are two buttons labeled Boot and EN.  The EN button is not available
to software.  It pulls the chip enable line that doubles as a reset line.

The BOOT button is connected to IO0.  On reset it is used as a strapping
pin to determine whether the chip boots normally or into the serial
bootloader.  After reset, however, the BOOT button can be used for software
input.

Board LEDs
----------

There are several on-board LEDs for that indicate the presence of power
and USB activity.  None of these are available for use by software.

Configurations
==============

All of the configurations presented below can be tested by running the following commands::

    $ ./tools/configure.sh esp32s3-devkit:<config_name>
    $ make flash ESPTOOL_PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0 -j

Where <config_name> is the name of board configuration you want to use, i.e.: nsh, buttons, wifi...
Then use a serial console terminal like ``picocom`` configured to 115200 8N1.

buttons
-------

This configuration shows the use of the buttons subsystem. It can be used by executing
the ``buttons`` application and pressing on any of the available board buttons::

    nsh> buttons
    buttons_main: Starting the button_daemon
    buttons_main: button_daemon started
    button_daemon: Running
    button_daemon: Opening /dev/buttons
    button_daemon: Supported BUTTONs 0x01
    nsh> Sample = 1
    Sample = 0

coremark
--------

This configuration sets the CoreMark benchmark up for running on the maximum
number of cores for this system. It also enables some optimization flags and
disables the NuttShell to get the best possible score.

.. note:: As the NSH is disabled, the application will start as soon as the
  system is turned on.

cxx
---

Development enviroment ready for C++ applications. You can check if the setup
was successfull by running ``cxxtest``::

    nsh> cxxtest
    Test ofstream ================================
    printf: Starting test_ostream
    printf: Successfully opened /dev/console
    cout: Successfully opened /dev/console
    Writing this to /dev/console
    Test iostream ================================
    Hello, this is only a test
    Print an int: 190
    Print a char: d
    Test std::vector =============================
    v1=1 2 3
    Hello World Good Luck
    Test std::map ================================
    Test C++17 features ==========================
    File /proc/meminfo exists!
    Invalid file! /invalid
    File /proc/version exists!

i2c
---

This configuration can be used to scan and manipulate I2C devices.
You can scan for all I2C devices using the following command::

    nsh> i2c dev 0x00 0x7f

knsh
----

This is identical to the nsh configuration except that (1) NuttX
is built as PROTECTED mode, monolithic module and the user applications
are built separately and, as a consequence, (2) some features that are
only available in the FLAT build are disabled.

Protected Mode support for ESP32-S3 relies on the World Controller (WC)
and Permission Control (PMS) peripherals for implementing isolation
between Kernel and Userspace.

By working together with the MMU and Static MPUs of the ESP32-S3, the WC/PMS
is able to restrict the application access to peripherals, on-chip
memories (Internal ROM and Internal SRAM) and off-chip memories (External
Flash and PSRAM).

.. warning:: The World Controller and Permission Control **do not** prevent
  the application from accessing CPU System Registers.

mcuboot_nsh
-----------

Similar configuration as nsh, except that it enables booting from
MCUboot and the experimental features configuration.
You can find more information on the `example's documentation <https://github.com/apache/nuttx-apps/blob/master/examples/mcuboot/swap_test/README.md>`_.

nsh
---

Basic NuttShell configuration (console enabled in UART0, exposed via
USB connection by means of CP2102 converter, at 115200 bps).

oneshot
-------

This config demonstrate the use of oneshot timers present on the ESP32-S3.
To test it, just run the ``oneshot`` example::

    nsh> oneshot
    Opening /dev/oneshot
    Maximum delay is 4294967295999999
    Starting oneshot timer with delay 2000000 microseconds
    Waiting...
    Finished

psram_quad
----------

This config tests the PSRAM driver over SPIRAM interface in quad mode.
You can use the mm command to test the PSRAM memory::

    nsh> mm
        mallinfo:
          Total space allocated from system = 8803232
          Number of non-inuse chunks        = 2
          Largest non-inuse chunk           = 8388592
          Total allocated space             = 9672
          Total non-inuse space             = 8793560
    (0)Allocating 5011 bytes

    ......

    (31)Releasing memory at 0x3fc8c088 (size=24 bytes)
        mallinfo:
          Total space allocated from system = 8803232
          Number of non-inuse chunks        = 2
          Largest non-inuse chunk           = 8388592
          Total allocated space             = 9672
          Total non-inuse space             = 8793560
    TEST COMPLETE

psram_octal
-----------

Similar to the ```psram_quad``` configuration but using the SPIRAM
interface in octal mode.

pwm
---

This configuration demonstrates the use of PWM through a LED connected to GPIO2.
To test it, just execute the ``pwm`` application::

    nsh> pwm
    pwm_main: starting output with frequency: 10000 duty: 00008000
    pwm_main: stopping output

random
------

This configuration shows the use of the ESP32-S3's True Random Number Generator with
entropy sourced from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth noise.
To test it, just run ``rand`` to get 32 randomly generated bytes::

    nsh> rand
    Reading 8 random numbers
    Random values (0x3ffe0b00):
    0000  98 b9 66 a2 a2 c0 a2 ae 09 70 93 d1 b5 91 86 c8  ..f......p......
    0010  8f 0e 0b 04 29 64 21 72 01 92 7c a2 27 60 6f 90  ....)d!r..|.'`o.

smp
---

Another NSH configuration, similar to nsh, but also enables
SMP operation.  It differs from the nsh configuration only in these
additional settings:

SMP is enabled::

  CONFIG_SMP=y
  CONFIG_SMP_NCPUS=2
  CONFIG_SPINLOCK=y

The apps/testing/smp test is included::

  CONFIG_TESTING_SMP=y
  CONFIG_TESTING_SMP_NBARRIER_THREADS=8
  CONFIG_TESTING_SMP_PRIORITY=100
  CONFIG_TESTING_SMP_STACKSIZE=2048

spiflash
--------

This config tests the external SPI that comes with the ESP32-S3 module connected
through SPI1.

By default a SmartFS file system is selected.
Once booted you can use the following commands to mount the file system::

    nsh> mksmartfs /dev/smart0
    nsh> mount -t smartfs /dev/smart0 /mnt

Note that mksmartfs is only needed the first time.

sta_softap
----------

With this configuration you can run these commands to be able
to connect your smartphone or laptop to your board::

  nsh> ifup wlan1
  nsh> dhcpd_start wlan1
  nsh> wapi psk wlan1 mypasswd 3
  nsh> wapi essid wlan1 nuttxap 1

In this case, you are creating the access point ``nuttxapp`` in your board and to
connect to it on your smartphone you will be required to type the password ``mypasswd``
using WPA2.

.. tip:: Please refer to :ref:`ESP32 Wi-Fi SoftAP Mode <esp32_wi-fi_softap>`
  for more information.

The ``dhcpd_start`` is necessary to let your board to associate an IP to your smartphone.

tickless
--------

This configuration enables the support for tickless scheduler mode.

timer
-----

This config test the general use purpose timers. It includes the 4 timers,
adds driver support, registers the timers as devices and includes the timer
example.

To test it, just run the following::

  nsh> timer -d /dev/timerx

Where x in the timer instance.

usbnsh
------

Basic NuttShell configuration console enabled over USB Device (USB CDC/ACM).

Before using this configuration, please confirm that your computer detected
that USB JTAG/serial interface used to flash the board::

  usb 3-5.2.3: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
  usb 3-5.2.3: Product: USB JTAG/serial debug unit

  usb 3-5.2.3: SerialNumber: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
  cdc_acm 3-5.2.3:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device

Then you can run the configuration and compilation procedure::

  $ ./tools/configure.sh esp32s3-devkit:usbnsh
  $ make flash ESPTOOL_PORT=/dev/ttyACM0 -j8

Then run the minicom configured to /dev/ttyACM0 115200 8n1 and
press <ENTER> three times to force the nsh to show up::

            -> Network initialization (NETUTILS_NETINIT [=y])
                -> WAPI Configuration

Or if you don't want to keep it saved in the firmware you can do it
at runtime::

    nsh> wapi psk wlan0 mypasswd 3
    nsh> wapi essid wlan0 myssid 1
    nsh> renew wlan0

.. tip:: Please refer to :ref:`ESP32 Wi-Fi Station Mode <esp32_wi-fi_sta>`
  for more information.
