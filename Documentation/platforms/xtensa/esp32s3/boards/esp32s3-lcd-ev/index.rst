The `ESP32-S3-LCD-EV-Board <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32s3/esp32-s3-lcd-ev-board/user_guide.html>`_  is a small-sized AI development board from Espressif featuring the ESP32-S3 CPU with a touchscreen LCD display, dual microphone, an 16 MB Octal PSRAM and an 16 MB flash.

Features
========

  - ESP32-S3 WROOM-1 Module
  - USB Type-C ports
  - Power LED
  - LCD Display
  - MEMS Microphone
  - 16MB Octal PSRAM
  - 16MB SPI Flash
  - RST and BOOT buttons (BOOT accessible to user)

Serial Console
==============

UART0 is, by default, the serial console.  It connects to the on-board
CP2102 converter and is available on the USB connector USB CON8 (J1).

It will show up as /dev/ttyUSB[n] where [n] will probably be 0.

Buttons and LEDs
================

Board Buttons
-------------

There are two buttons labeled Boot and EN.  The EN button is not available
to software.  It pulls the chip enable line that doubles as a reset line.

The BOOT button is connected to IO0.  On reset it is used as a strapping
pin to determine whether the chip boots normally or into the serial
bootloader.  After reset, however, the BOOT button can be used for software
input.

Board LEDs
----------

There are several on-board LEDs for that indicate the presence of power
and USB activity.  None of these are available for use by software.
Another WS2812 LED is connected to GPIO4.

Configurations
==============

All of the configurations presented below can be tested by running the following commands::

    $ ./tools/configure.sh esp32s3-lcd-ev:<config_name>
    $ make flash ESPTOOL_PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0 -j

Where <config_name> is the name of board configuration you want to use, i.e.: nsh, buttons, wifi...
Then use a serial console terminal like ``picocom`` configured to 115200 8N1.

audio
-----

This configuration uses the I2S0 peripheral and an externally connected audio
codec to play an audio file streamed over an HTTP connection while connected
to a Wi-Fi network.

**Audio Codec Setup**

The CS4344 audio codec is connected to the following pins:

============ ========== ============================================
ESP32-S3 Pin CS4344 Pin Description
============ ========== ============================================
5            MCLK       Master Clock
16           SCLK       Serial Clock
7            LRCK       Left Right Clock (Word Select)
6            SDIN       Serial Data In on CS4344. (DOUT on ESP32-S3)
============ ========== ============================================

**Simple HTTP server**

Prepare a PCM-encoded (`.wav`) audio file with 16 or 24 bits/sample (sampled at
16~48kHz). This file must be placed into a folder in a computer that could
be accessed on the same Wi-Fi network the ESP32 will be connecting to.

Python provides a simple HTTP server. ``cd`` to the audio file folder on the
PC and run::

    $ python3 -m http.server
    Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/)

Look for your PC IP address and test playing the prepared audio on your
browser:

.. figure:: esp32s3-audio-config-file.png
          :align: center

After successfully built and flashed, connect the board to the Wi-Fi network::

    nsh> wapi psk wlan0 mypasswd 3
    nsh> wapi essid wlan0 myssid 1
    nsh> renew wlan0

Once connected, open NuttX's player and play the file according to the filename
and the IP address of the HTTP server::

    nsh> nxplayer
    nxplayer> play http://192.168.1.239:8000/tones.wav

buttons
-------

This configuration shows the use of the buttons subsystem. It can be used by executing
the ``buttons`` application and pressing on any of the available board buttons::

    nsh> buttons
    buttons_main: Starting the button_daemon
    buttons_main: button_daemon started
    button_daemon: Running
    button_daemon: Opening /dev/buttons
    button_daemon: Supported BUTTONs 0x01
    nsh> Sample = 1
    Sample = 0

lvgl
----

This is a demonstration of the LVGL graphics library running on the NuttX LCD
driver. You can find LVGL here::

    https://www.lvgl.io/
    https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl

This configuration uses the LVGL demonstration at `apps/examples/lvgldemo`.

nsh
---

Basic NuttShell configuration (console enabled in UART0, exposed via
USB connection by means of CP2102 converter, at 115200 bps).

ws2812
------

This configuration enables the usage of the RMT peripheral and the example
``ws2812`` to drive addressable RGB LEDs::

    nsh> ws2812

Please note that this board contains an on-board WS2812 LED connected to GPIO38
and, by default, this config configures the RMT transmitter in the same pin.
