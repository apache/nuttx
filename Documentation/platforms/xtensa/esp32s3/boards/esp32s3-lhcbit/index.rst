Configurations
==============

All of the configurations presented below can be tested by running the following commands::

    tools/configure.sh esp32s3-lhcbit:<subdir>

  Where <subdir> is one of the following:

Configuration Directories
-------------------------

usbnsh
------

Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at apps/examples/nsh. This configuration enables a serial console over USB.

After flasing and reboot your board you should see in your dmesg logs::

    $ sudo dmesg | tail
