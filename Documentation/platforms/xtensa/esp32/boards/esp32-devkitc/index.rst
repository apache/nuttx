ESP32 DevKitC
=============

The `ESP32 DevKitC <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/hw-reference/modules-and-boards.html#esp32-devkitc-v4>`_ is a development board for the ESP32 SoC from Espressif, based on a ESP-WROOM-32 module. You can find the original V2 version and the newer V4 variant. They are
pin compatible.

Features
========

  - ESP32 WROOM Module
  - USB-to-UART bridge via micro USB port
  - Power LED
  - EN and BOOT buttons (BOOT accessible to user)
  - SPI FLASH (size varies according to model

Serial Console
==============

UART0 is, by default, the serial console.  It connects to the on-board
CP2102 converter and is available on the USB connector USB CON8 (J1).

It will show up as /dev/ttypUSB[n] where [n] will probably be 0 (is it 1
on my PC because I have a another device at ttyUSB0).

Buttons and LEDs
================

Buttons
-------

There are two buttons labeled Boot and EN.  The EN button is not available
to software.  It pulls the chip enable line that doubles as a reset line.

The BOOT button is connected to IO0.  On reset it is used as a strapping
pin to determine whether the chip boots normally or into the serial
bootloader.  After reset, however, the BOOT button can be used for software
input.

LEDs
----

There are several on-board LEDs for that indicate the presence of power
and USB activity.  None of these are available for use by software.

Ethernet
========

ESP32 has a 802.11 hardware MAC, so just connects to external PHY chip.
Due to the limited number of GPIOs in ESP32, it's recommended to use RMII to
connect to an external PHY chip. Current driver also only supports RMII option.

The RMII GPIO pins are fixed, but the SMI and functional GPIO pins are optional.

RMII GPIO pins are as following::

    ESP32 GPIO          PHY Chip GPIO
      IO25       <-->       RXD[0]
      IO26       <-->       RXD[1]
      IO27       <-->       CRS_DV
      IO0        <-->       REF_CLK
      IO19       <-->       TXD[0]
      IO21       <-->       TX_EN
      IO22       <-->       TXD[1]

SMI GPIO pins (default option) are as following::

    ESP32 GPIO          PHY Chip GPIO
      IO18       <-->       MDIO
      IO23       <-->       MDC

Functional GPIO pins(default option) are as following::

    ESP32 GPIO          PHY Chip GPIO
      IO5        <-->      Reset_N

Espressif has an `official Ethernet development
board <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/hw-reference/esp32/get-started-ethernet-kit.html>`_.

This driver has been tested according to this board and ESP32 core
board + LAN8720 module. If users have some issue about using this driver,
please refer the upper official document, specially the issue that GPIO0
causes failing to bring the ESP32 chip up.

Configurations
==============

nsh
---

Basic NuttShell configuration (console enabled in UART0, exposed via
USB connection by means of CP2102 converter, at 115200 bps).

wapi
----

Enables Wi-Fi support. You can define your credentials this way::

    $ make menuconfig
    -> Application Configuration
        -> Network Utilities
            -> Network initialization (NETUTILS_NETINIT [=y])
                -> WAPI Configuration

Or if you don't want to keep it saved in the firmware you can do it
at runtime::

    nsh> wapi psk wlan0 mypasswd 1
    nsh> wapi essid wlan0 myssid 1
    nsh> renew wlan0

wifinsh
-------

The ``wifinsh`` is similar to the ``wapi`` board example, but it will connect
automatically to your Access Point (Wi-Fi Router) and will run telnet daemon
in the board. Then you can connect to your board from your computer using the
telnet program.

After configuring the ``esp32-devkit:wifinsh`` you need to define your creden-
tials in the menuconfig. You can define your credentials this way::

    $ make menuconfig
    -> Application Configuration
        -> Network Utilities
            -> Network initialization (NETUTILS_NETINIT [=y])
                -> WAPI Configuration

Find your board IP using ``nsh> ifconfig`` and then from your computer::

    $ telnet 192.168.x.y

Where x and y are the last two numbers of the IP that your router gave to
your board.

mqttc
-----

This configuration tests the MQTT-C publisher example.

From the host, start the broker and subscribe to the :code:`test` topic.  Using
`mosquitto` this should be::

    $ mosquitto&
    $ mosquitto_sub -t test

From the NSH, connect to an access point::

    nsh> wapi psk wlan0 mypasswd 1
    nsh> wapi essid wlan0 myssid 1
    nsh> renew wlan0

Publish to the broker::

    nsh> mqttc_pub -h 192.168.1.11

The default behavior is to publish the message :code:`test`.  The following should be
outputted::

    nsh> mqttc_pub -h 192.168.1.11
         Success: Connected to broker!
         Success: Published to broker!

         Disconnecting from 192.168.1.11

From the host the message :code:`test` should be outputted.

smp
---

Another NSH configuration, similar to nsh, but also enables
SMP operation.  It differs from the nsh configuration only in these
additional settings:

SMP is enabled::

  CONFIG_SMP=y
  CONFIG_SMP_NCPUS=2
  CONFIG_SPINLOCK=y

The apps/testing/smp test is included::

  CONFIG_TESTING_SMP=y
  CONFIG_TESTING_SMP_NBARRIER_THREADS=8
  CONFIG_TESTING_SMP_PRIORITY=100
  CONFIG_TESTING_SMP_STACKSIZE=2048

ostest
------

This is the NuttX test at apps/testing/ostest that is run against all new
architecture ports to assure a correct implementation of the OS.  The default
version is for a single CPU but can be modified for an SMP test by adding::

  CONFIG_SMP=y
  CONFIG_SMP_NCPUS=2
  CONFIG_SPINLOCK=y

mcp2515
-------

This config is used to communicate with MCP2515 CAN over SPI chip.
SPI3 is used and kept with the default IOMUX pins, i.e.::

    CS   --> 5
    SCK  --> 18
    MOSI --> 23
    MISO --> 19

The MCP2515 interrupt (INT) pin is connected to the pin 22 of the
ESP32-Devkit.

mmcsdspi
--------

This config tests the SPI driver by connecting an SD Card reader over SPI.
SPI2 is used and kept with the default IOMUX pins, i.e.::

    CS   --> 15
    SCK  --> 14
    MOSI --> 13
    MISO --> 12

Once booted the following command is used to mount a FAT file system::

    nsh> mount -t vfat /dev/mmcsd0 /mnt

module
------

This config is to run apps/examples/module.

sotest
------

This config is to run apps/examples/sotest.

spiflash
--------

This config tests the external SPI that comes with an ESP32 module connected
through SPI1.

By default a SmartFS file system is selected.
Once booted you can use the following commands to mount the file system::

    nsh> mksmartfs /dev/smart0
    nsh> mount -t smartfs /dev/smart0 /mnt

Note that mksmartfs is only needed the first time.

psram
-----

This config tests the PSRAM driver over SPIRAM interface.
You can use the ramtest command to test the PSRAM memory. We are testing
only 64KB on this example (64 * 1024), but you can change this number to
2MB or 4MB depending on PSRAM chip used on your board::

    nsh> ramtest -w 0x3F800000 65536
    RAMTest: Marching ones: 3f800000 65536
    RAMTest: Marching zeroes: 3f800000 65536
    RAMTest: Pattern test: 3f800000 65536 55555555 aaaaaaaa
    RAMTest: Pattern test: 3f800000 65536 66666666 99999999
    RAMTest: Pattern test: 3f800000 65536 33333333 cccccccc
    RAMTest: Address-in-address test: 3f800000 65536

timer
-----

This config test the general use purpose timers. It includes the 4 timers,
adds driver support, registers the timers as devices and includes the timer
example.

To test it, just run the following::

  nsh> timer -d /dev/timerx

Where x in the timer instance.

watchdog
--------

This config test the watchdog timers. It includes the 2 MWDTS,
adds driver support, registers the WDTs as devices and includes the watchdog
example.

To test it, just run the following::

  nsh> wdog -d /dev/watchdogx

Where x in the watchdog instance.
