ESP-WROVER-KIT
==============

The `ESP-WROVER-KIT <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/hw-reference/esp32/get-started-wrover-kit.html>`_ is a development board for the ESP32 SoC from Espressif, based on a ESP32-WROVER-B module.

Features
========

  - ESP32-WROVER-B module
  - LCD screen
  - MicroSD card slot

Its another distinguishing feature is the embedded FTDI FT2232HL chip,
an advanced multi-interface USB bridge. This chip enables to use JTAG
for direct debugging of ESP32 through the USB interface without a separate
JTAG debugger. ESP-WROVER-KIT makes development convenient, easy, and
cost-effective.

Most of the ESP32 I/O pins are broken out to the boardâ€™s pin headers for easy access.

Serial Console
==============

UART0 is, by default, the serial console. It connects to the on-board
FT2232HL converter and is available on the USB connector USB CON8 (J5).

It will show up as /dev/ttyUSB[n] where [n] will probably be 1, since
the first interface ([n] == 0) is dedicated to the USB-to-JTAG interface.

Buttons and LEDs
================

Buttons
-------

There are two buttons labeled Boot and EN. The EN button is not available
to software. It pulls the chip enable line that doubles as a reset line.

The BOOT button is connected to IO0. On reset it is used as a strapping
pin to determine whether the chip boots normally or into the serial
bootloader. After reset, however, the BOOT button can be used for software
input.

LEDs
----

There are several on-board LEDs for that indicate the presence of power
and USB activity.

There is an RGB LED available for software.

Configurations
==============

nsh
---

Basic NuttShell configuration (console enabled in UART0, exposed via
USB connection by means of FT2232HL converter, at 115200 bps).

wapi
----

Enables Wi-Fi support.

gpio
----

This is a test for the GPIO driver. It includes the 3 LEDs and one, arbitrary, GPIO.
For this example, GPIO22 was used.
At the nsh, we can turn LEDs on and off with the following::

    nsh> gpio -o 1 /dev/gpio0
    nsh> gpio -o 0 /dev/gpio0

We can use the interrupt pin to send a signal when the interrupt fires::

    nsh> gpio -w 14 /dev/gpio2

The pin is configured to as a rising edge interrupt, so after issuing the
above command, connect it to 3.3V.

spiflash
--------

This config tests the external SPI that comes with an ESP32 module connected
through SPI1.

By default a SmartFS file system is selected.
Once booted you can use the following commands to mount the file system::

    mksmartfs /dev/smart0
    mount -t smartfs /dev/smart0 /mnt

Note that `mksmartfs` is only needed the first time.

nx
--

This config adds a set of tests using the graphic examples at `apps/example/nx`.

This configuration illustrates the use of the LCD with the lower performance
SPI interface.

lvgl
----

This is a demonstration of the LVGL graphics library running on the NuttX LCD
driver. You can find LVGL here::

    https://www.lvgl.io/
    https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl

This configuration uses the LVGL demonstration at `apps/examples/lvgldemo`.

External devices
=================

BMP180
------

When using BMP180 (enabling ``CONFIG_SENSORS_BMP180``), it's expected this device is wired to I2C0 bus.
