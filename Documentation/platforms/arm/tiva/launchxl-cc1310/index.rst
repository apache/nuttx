Serial Console
==============

The on-board XDS110 Debugger provides a USB virtual serial console using
UART0 (PA0/U0RX and PA1/U0TX).

A J-Link debugger is used (see below), then the RXD/TXD jumper pins can
be used to support a serial console through appropriate TTL level adapter
(RS-232 or USB serial).

LEDs and Buttons
================

LEDs
----

The LaunchXL-cc1312R1 has two LEDs controlled by software:  DIO7_GLED (CR1)
and DIO6_RLED (CR2).  A high output value illuminates an LED.

=========  ==== ========================
DIO7_GLED  CR1  High output illuminates
DIO6_RLED  CR2  High output illuminates
=========  ==== ========================

If CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is not defined, then the user can control the LEDs in
any way.  The definitions provided in the board.h header file can be used
to access individual LEDs.

These LEDs are not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
include/board.h and src/cc1310_autoleds.c. The LEDs are used to encode
OS-related events as follows:

================== ======================== ====== ======
SYMBOL              Meaning                 G-LED   R-LED
================== ======================== ====== ======
LED_STARTED        NuttX has been started   OFF    OFF
LED_HEAPALLOCATE   Heap has been allocated  OFF    ON
LED_IRQSENABLED    Interrupts enabled       OFF    ON
LED_STACKCREATED   Idle stack created       ON     OFF
LED_INIRQ          In an interrupt          N/C    GLOW
LED_SIGNAL         In a signal handler      N/C    GLOW
LED_ASSERTION      An assertion failed      N/C    GLOW
LED_PANIC          The system has crashed   OFF    Blinking
LED_IDLE           MCU is is sleep mode     N/A    N/A
================== ======================== ====== ======

Thus if GLED is statically on, NuttX has successfully booted and is,
apparently, running normally.  A soft glow of the RLED means that the
board is taking interrupts.   If GLED is off and GLED is flashing at
approximately 2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system
has halted.

Buttons
-------

The LaunchXL-CC1310 has two push-puttons:

=========== ==== ===============================
DIO13_BTN1  SW1  Low input sensed when depressed
DIO14_BTN2  SW2  Low input sensed when depressed
=========== ==== ===============================

Using J-Link
============

Reference https://wiki.segger.com/CC1310_LaunchPad:

When shipped, the TI CC1310 LaunchPad evaluation board is configured to be
used with the on-board debug probe.  In order to use it with J-Link, the
on-board debug probe needs to be isolated to make sure that it does not
drive the debug signals.  This can be done by removing some jumpers next
to the XDS110 Out / CC1310 In connector [RXD, TXD, RST, TMS, TCK, TDO, TDI,
SWO].  After isolating the on-board probe, the CC130F128 device can be
debugged using J-Link.  The J-Link needs to be connected to the board
using the micro JTAG connector marked "In".

I use the Olimex ARM-JTAG-20-10 to interface with the board:
https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/ARM-JTAG-20-10/

NOTE:  When connecting the J-Link GDB server, the interface must be set to
JTAG, not SWD as you might expect.

The RXD/TXD pins. PA0/U0RX and PA1/U0TX, can then support a Serial console
using the appropriate TTL adapter (TTL to RS-232 or TTL to USB serial).
