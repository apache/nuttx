==========================
Nordic nRF52 IEEE 802.15.4
==========================

.. note::

   This driver is highly experimental.
   Help with development and testing will be appreciated ;)

Supported features:

* frame transmission
* frame reception and filtering
* immediate ACK (incoming and outgoing)
* promiscuous mode
* delayed transmision
* radio events trace
* setting pending bit for all incoming Data Request frames
* un-slotted CSMA-CA

Work in progres features (some logic is present, but they require more work):
    
* beacon transmision (periodic transmition works, but requires verification)
* slotted CSMA-CA
* GTS

Fetures not implemented:

* enhanced ACK (Enh-ACK)
* enhanced beacon
* low power mode
* advanced features from IEEE 802.15.4e (DSME, TSCH)

Reserved peripherals
====================

This implementation reserves the following peripherals:

* ``RADIO`` - used for radio operations

* ``TIMER0`` - used as high resolution timer for ACK, IFS and other radio delays

* ``RTC0`` - if superframe support is enabled, used as low power timer to hande
  superframe events
