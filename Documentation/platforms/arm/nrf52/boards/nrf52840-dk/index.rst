The `NRF52840-DK (PCA10056) <https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF52840-DK>`_
is a development board for the nRF52840 SoC from Nordic.

Serial Console
==============

The PCA10056 default console is the UART0.

The PCA10056 does not have RS-232 drivers or serial connectors on board.
UART0 is connected to the virtual COM port:

========  =====
Signal    PIN
