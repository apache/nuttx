Olimex STM32-P207
=================

The NuttX configuration for the Olimex STM32-H405 is based on the configuration
Olimex STM32-P207.

It was tested with the NuttX EABI "buildroot" Toolchain.

Debugging with OpenOCD via an Olimex ARM-USB-TINY-H works. Note that
CONFIG_DEBUG_SYMBOLS and CONFIG_STM32_DISABLE_IDLE_SLEEP_DURING_DEBUG
are enabled so that the JTAG connection is not disconnected by the idle
loop.

Make sure that '# CONFIG_NSH_CONDEV is not set' is in the .config file - it defaults
to '/dev/console' which makes problems with the shell over USB.

The following peripherals are enabled in this configuration.
- LED: Shows the system status

- Button: Built in app 'buttons' works.

- ADC: ADC1 samples ADC_IN1. Built in app 'adc' works.

- USB-FS-OTG: The console is running on the virtual serial port. Note that you
  have to press enter three times until NSH appears.

- CAN:Built in app 'can' is enabled but not tested, since no CAN transceiver is on board.
