Configuration Directories
-------------------------

nsh
---

Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at apps/examples/nsh. This
configuration enables a serial console on USART6.


usbnsh
------

Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at apps/examples/nsh. This
configuration enables a serial console over USB.

After flasing and reboot your board you should see in your dmesg logs::

       [ 2638.948089] usb 1-1.4: new full-speed USB device number 16 using xhci_hcd
       [ 2639.054432] usb 1-1.4: New USB device found, idVendor=0525, idProduct=a4a7, bcdDevice= 1.01

You may need to press **ENTER** 3 times before the NSH show up.

sdcard
------

Configures the NuttShell (nsh) and enables SD card support.
The stm32f401rc-rs485 has an onboard microSD slot that should
be automatically registered as the block device /dev/mmcsd0 when
an SD card is present.  The SD card can then be mounted by the
NSH commands::

       nsh> mount -t procfs /proc
       nsh> mount -t vfat /dev/mmcsd0 /mnt

modbus_slave
------------

Configures the NuttShell (nsh) and enables modbus in slave mode. This
configuration enables a serial console on USART6. The RS-485 is connected
to USART2. Follow below precedure to use modbus test aplication, you will
need a USB to RS-485 converter to connect the board to a PC via RS-485.

NuttShell configuration:

Run modbus application at NSH::

       nsh> modbus -help
       USAGE: modbus [-d|e|s|q|h]

       Where:
         -d : Disable protocol stack
         -e : Enable the protocol stack
         -s : Show current status
         -q : Quit application
         -h : Show this information

       nsh> modbus -e

PC Configuration:

Download and install mbpoll aplication::

       sudo apt install mbpoll

Check which TTY USB port is being used by you USB to RS-485 converter::

       sudo dmesg
       [99846.668209] usb 1-1.3: Product: USB Serial
       [99846.676313] ch341 1-1.3:1.0: ch341-uart converter detected
       [99846.677454] usb 1-1.3: ch341-uart converter now attached to ttyUSB1

Run the mbpoll as below::

       mbpoll -a 10 -b 38400 -t 3 -r 1000 -c 4 /dev/ttyUSB1 -R


At PC terminal you will see the mbpoll application receiving the random values
generated by STM32F401RC-RS485 and transmitted over RS-485::
