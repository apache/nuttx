Configuration Directories
-------------------------

nsh
---

Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at apps/examples/nsh. This
configuration enables a serial console on USART6.


usbnsh
------

Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at apps/examples/nsh. This
configuration enables a serial console over USB.

After flasing and reboot your board you should see in your dmesg logs::

       [ 2638.948089] usb 1-1.4: new full-speed USB device number 16 using xhci_hcd
       [ 2639.054432] usb 1-1.4: New USB device found, idVendor=0525, idProduct=a4a7, bcdDevice= 1.01

       nsh> modbus -help
       USAGE: modbus [-d|e|s|q|h]

       Where:
         -d : Disable protocol stack
         -e : Enable the protocol stack
         -s : Show current status
         -q : Quit application
         -h : Show this information

       nsh> modbus -e

PC Configuration:

Download and install mbpoll aplication::

       sudo apt install mbpoll

Check which TTY USB port is being used by you USB to RS-485 converter::

NSH commands::

       nsh> lm75 -help
       Usage: temp [OPTIONS]
         [-n count] selects the samples to collect.  Default: 1 Current: 100
         [-h] shows this message and exits
       nsh> lm75 -n 3
       30.13 degrees Celsius
       30.13 degrees Celsius
       30.13 degrees Celsius

adc
---

Configures the NuttShell (nsh) over USB Serial (check usbserial configuration) and enables ADC 1 on channels 0 and 4.
NSH commands::

       nsh> adc -h
       Usage: adc [OPTIONS]

       Arguments are "sticky".  For example, once the ADC device is
       specified, that device will be re-used until it is changed.

       "sticky" OPTIONS include:
         [-p devpath] selects the ADC device.  Default: /dev/adc0 Current: /dev/adc0
         [-n count] selects the samples to collect.  Default: 1 Current: 0

       1: channel: 0 value: 2684
       Sample:
       1: channel: 4 value: 2682

Currently there is a bug that causes the application to always read the same value for channel 0 and 4. If you want to read the value from channel 2, you will need to enable the config "ADC1 Scan Mode".
