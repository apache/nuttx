       Arguments are "sticky".  For example, once the ADC device is
       specified, that device will be re-used until it is changed.

       "sticky" OPTIONS include:
         [-p devpath] selects the ADC device.  Default: /dev/adc0 Current: /dev/adc0
         [-n count] selects the samples to collect.  Default: 1 Current: 0

As this LED matrix can be combined either horizontally or vetically,
you can configure this using menuconfig::

       Number of 8x8 LEDs matrices in the horizontal (width)
       Number of 8x8 LEDs matrices in the vertical (height)

bmp280
------

Configures the NuttShell (nsh) over USB Serial (check usbserial configuration) and enables BMP280 Digital Pressure Sensor.
BMP280 has an I2C address that can be configure by SDO. Connecting SDO to GND results in slave
address 0x76, connection it to VDD results in slave address 0x77. This can be configured by enabling BMP280_I2C_ADDR_76 or BMP280_I2C_ADDR_77. This configuration uses I2C1 and slave address 0x77.

There is a known issue where every time the sensor is initialized, the first measurement is wrong, please check https://github.com/apache/nuttx/issues/12421 for the latest updates on this issue.

lcd1602
-------

This configuration sets up the NuttShell (NSH) interface over USB Serial (refer to the usbserial
configuration for details). It also enables I2C1 and the driver for an alphanumeric/segment LCD.
Specifically, the setup supports a 16x2 LCD screen based on the HD44780 controller, which is
interfaced using an I2C adapter known as the LCD Backpack, utilizing the PCF8574 chip.

ws2812
------

This configuration sets up the NuttShell (NSH) interface over USB Serial (refer to the usbserial
configuration for details). It also enables the driver for an addressable LED WS2812 and the SPI1.
The MOSI pin from SPI must be connected to DIN on WS2812 module and the number of LEDs can be
configured using CONFIG_WS2812_LED_COUNT.
