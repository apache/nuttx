Configurations
==============

Each stm32f401rc-rs485 configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
can be selected as follow::

    tools/configure.sh stm32f401rc-rs485:<subdir>

Where <subdir> is one of the following:


Configuration Directories
-------------------------

nsh
---

Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at apps/examples/nsh. This
configuration enables a serial console on UART2.

sdcard
------

Configures the NuttShell (nsh) and enables SD card support.
The stm32f401rc-rs485 has an onboard microSD slot that should
be automatically registered as the block device /dev/mmcsd0 when
an SD card is present.  The SD card can then be mounted by the
NSH commands::

       nsh> mount -t procfs /proc
       nsh> mount -t vfat /dev/mmcsd0 /mnt
