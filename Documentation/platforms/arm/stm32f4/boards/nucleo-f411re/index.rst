ST Nucleo F401RE
================

This page discusses issues unique to NuttX configurations for the ST
NucleoF401RE and NucleoF411RE boards from ST Micro.  See

  http://www.st.com/web/catalog/mmc/FM141/SC1169/SS1577/LN1877/PF260049

These two boards are very similar, both supporting STM32 "Dynamic Efficiency
Line" parts but differing in the specific STM32 chip mounted on board.  The
chips themselves are also very similar with the STM32F411RE having some
additional capability:

NucleoF411RE:

- Microprocessor: 32-bit ARM Cortex M4 at 100MHz STM32F411RE
- Memory: 512 KB Flash and 128 KB SRAM
- ADC: 1×12-bit, 2.4 MSPS A/D converter: up to 10 channels
- DMA: 16-stream DMA controllers with FIFOs and burst support
- Timers: Up to 11 timers: up to six 16-bit, two 32-bit timers, two
  watchdog timers, and a SysTick timer
- GPIO: Up to 81 I/O ports with interrupt capability
- I2C: Up to 3 × I2C interfaces
- USARTs: Up to 3 USARTs
- SPIs: Up to 4 SPIs (2 I2S)
- SDIO interface
- USB: USB 2.0 full-speed device/host/OTG controller with on-chip PHY
- CRC calculation unit
- RTC

The NucleoF411RE also has additional DMA and SPI peripheral capabilities.

Board features, however, are identical:

- Peripherals:    1 led, 1 push button
- Debug:          Serial wire debug and JTAG interfaces
- Expansion I/F   Ardino and Morpho Headers

Uses a STM32F103 to provide a ST-Link for programming, debug similar to the
OpenOcd FTDI function - USB to JTAG front-end.

See http://mbed.org/platforms/ST-Nucleo-F401RE and
http://developer.mbed.org/platforms/ST-Nucleo-F411RE for more
information about these boards.

mbed
====

The Nucleo-F411RE includes boot loader from mbed:

    https://mbed.org/platforms/ST-Nucleo-F401RE/
    https://mbed.org/handbook/Homepage

Using the mbed loader:

1. Connect the Nucleo-F4x1RE to the host PC using the USB connector.
2. A new file system will appear called NUCLEO; open it with Windows
   Explorer (assuming that you are using Windows).
3. Drag and drop nuttx.bin into the MBED window.  This will load the
   nuttx.bin binary into the Nucleo-F4x1RE.  The NUCLEO window will
   close then re-open and the Nucleo-F4x1RE will be running the new code.

Buttons
-------

B1 USER: the user button is connected to the I/O PC13 (pin 2) of the STM32
microcontroller.

LEDs
----

The Nucleo F401RE and Nucleo F411RE provide a single user LED, LD2.  LD2
is the green LED connected to Arduino signal D13 corresponding to MCU I/O
PA5 (pin 21) or PB13 (pin 34) depending on the STM32target.

- When the I/O is HIGH value, the LED is on.
- When the I/O is LOW, the LED is off.

These LEDs are not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
include/board.h and src/sam_leds.c. The LEDs are used to encode OS-related
events as follows when the red LED (PE24) is available:

    ===================  =======================  ===========
    SYMBOL                Meaning                   LD2
    ===================  =======================  ===========
    LED_STARTED          NuttX has been started     OFF
    LED_HEAPALLOCATE     Heap has been allocated    OFF
    LED_IRQSENABLED      Interrupts enabled         OFF
    LED_STACKCREATED     Idle stack created         ON
    LED_INIRQ            In an interrupt            No change
    LED_SIGNAL           In a signal handler        No change
    LED_ASSERTION        An assertion failed        No change
    LED_PANIC            The system has crashed     Blinking
    LED_IDLE             MCU is is sleep mode       Not used
    ===================  =======================  ===========

Thus if LD2, NuttX has successfully booted and is, apparently, running
normally.  If LD2 is flashing at approximately 2Hz, then a fatal error
has been detected and the system has halted.

Serial Consoles
===============

USART1
------

Pins and Connectors::

    RXD: PA11  CN10 pin 14
         PB7   CN7 pin 21
    TXD: PA10  CN9 pin 3, CN10 pin 33
         PB6   CN5 pin 3, CN10 pin 17

NOTE:  You may need to edit the include/board.h to select different USART1
pin selections.

TTL to RS-232 converter connection::

    Nucleo CN10 STM32F4x1RE
    ----------- ------------
    Pin 21 PA9  USART1_RX   *Warning you make need to reverse RX/TX on
    Pin 33 PA10 USART1_TX    some RS-232 converters
    Pin 20 GND
    Pin 8  U5V

To configure USART1 as the console::

    CONFIG_STM32_USART1=y
    CONFIG_USART1_SERIALDRIVER=y
    CONFIG_USART1_SERIAL_CONSOLE=y
    CONFIG_USART1_RXBUFSIZE=256
    CONFIG_USART1_TXBUFSIZE=256
    CONFIG_USART1_BAUD=115200
    CONFIG_USART1_BITS=8
    CONFIG_USART1_PARITY=0
    CONFIG_USART1_2STOP=0

USART2
------

Pins and Connectors::

    RXD: PA3   CN9 pin 1 (See SB13, 14, 62, 63). CN10 pin 37
         PD6
    TXD: PA2   CN9 pin 2(See SB13, 14, 62, 63). CN10 pin 35
         PD5

    UART2 is the default in all of these configurations.

TTL to RS-232 converter connection::

    Nucleo CN9  STM32F4x1RE
    ----------- ------------
    Pin 1  PA3  USART2_RX   *Warning you make need to reverse RX/TX on
    Pin 2  PA2  USART2_TX    some RS-232 converters

Solder Bridges.  This configuration requires:

- SB62 and SB63 Closed: PA2 and PA3 on STM32 MCU are connected to D1 and D0
  (pin 7 and pin 8) on Arduino connector CN9 and ST Morpho connector CN10
  as USART signals.  Thus SB13 and SB14 should be OFF.

- SB13 and SB14 Open:  PA2 and PA3 on STM32F103C8T6 (ST-LINK MCU) are
  disconnected to PA3 and PA2 on STM32 MCU.

To configure USART2 as the console::

    CONFIG_STM32_USART2=y
    CONFIG_USART2_SERIALDRIVER=y
    CONFIG_USART2_SERIAL_CONSOLE=y
    CONFIG_USART2_RXBUFSIZE=256
    CONFIG_USART2_TXBUFSIZE=256
    CONFIG_USART2_BAUD=115200
    CONFIG_USART2_BITS=8
    CONFIG_USART2_PARITY=0
    CONFIG_USART2_2STOP=0

USART6
------

Pins and Connectors::

    RXD: PC7    CN5 pin2, CN10 pin 19
         PA12   CN10, pin 12
    TXD: PC6    CN10, pin 4
         PA11   CN10, pin 14

To configure USART6 as the console::

    CONFIG_STM32_USART6=y
    CONFIG_USART6_SERIALDRIVER=y
    CONFIG_USART6_SERIAL_CONSOLE=y
    CONFIG_USART6_RXBUFSIZE=256
    CONFIG_USART6_TXBUFSIZE=256
    CONFIG_USART6_BAUD=115200
    CONFIG_USART6_BITS=8
    CONFIG_USART6_PARITY=0
    CONFIG_USART6_2STOP=0

Virtual COM Port
----------------

Yet another option is to use UART2 and the USB virtual COM port.  This
option may be more convenient for long term development, but is painful
to use during board bring-up.

Solder Bridges.  This configuration requires:

- SB62 and SB63 Open: PA2 and PA3 on STM32 MCU are disconnected to D1
  and D0 (pin 7 and pin 8) on Arduino connector CN9 and ST Morpho
  connector CN10.

- SB13 and SB14 Closed:  PA2 and PA3 on STM32F103C8T6 (ST-LINK MCU) are
  connected to PA3 and PA2 on STM32 MCU to have USART communication
  between them. Thus SB61, SB62 and SB63 should be OFF.

Configuring USART2 is the same as given above.

Question:  What BAUD should be configure to interface with the Virtual
COM port?  115200 8N1?

Default
-------

As shipped, SB62 and SB63 are open and SB13 and SB14 closed, so the
virtual COM port is enabled.

Shields
=======

RS-232 from Cutedigi.com
------------------------

Supports a single RS-232 connected via::

    Nucleo CN9  STM32F4x1RE  Cutedigi
    ----------- ------------ --------
    Pin 1  PA3  USART2_RX    RXD
    Pin 2  PA2  USART2_TX    TXD

Support for this shield is enabled by selecting USART2 and configuring
SB13, 14, 62, and 63 as described above under "Serial Consoles"

Itead Joystick Shield
---------------------

See http://imall.iteadstudio.com/im120417014.html for more information
about this joystick.

Itead Joystick Connection::

    --------- ----------------- ---------------------------------
    ARDUINO   ITEAD             NUCLEO-F4x1
    PIN NAME  SIGNAL            SIGNAL
    --------- ----------------- ---------------------------------
     D3       Button E Output   PB3
     D4       Button D Output   PB5
     D5       Button C Output   PB4
     D6       Button B Output   PB10
     D7       Button A Output   PA8
     D8       Button F Output   PA9
     D9       Button G Output   PC7
     A0       Joystick Y Output PA0  ADC1_0
     A1       Joystick X Output PA1  ADC1_1
    --------- ----------------- ---------------------------------

    All buttons are pulled on the shield.  A sensed low value indicates
    when the button is pressed.

    NOTE: Button F cannot be used with the default USART1 configuration
    because PA9 is configured for USART1_RX by default.  Use select
    different USART1 pins in the board.h file or select a different
    USART or select CONFIG_NUCLEO_F401RE_AJOY_MINBUTTONS which will
    eliminate all but buttons A, B, and C.

Itead Joystick configuration settings::

    System Type -> STM32 Peripheral Support
      CONFIG_STM32_ADC1=y              : Enable ADC1 driver support

    Drivers
      CONFIG_ANALOG=y                  : Should be automatically selected
      CONFIG_ADC=y                     : Should be automatically selected
      CONFIG_INPUT=y                   : Select input device support
      CONFIG_INPUT_AJOYSTICK=y         : Select analog joystick support

There is nothing in the configuration that currently uses the joystick.
For testing, you can add the following configuration options to enable the
analog joystick example at apps/examples/ajoystick::

    CONFIG_NSH_ARCHINIT=y
    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_AJOYSTICK=y
    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_AJOYSTICK_DEVNAME="/dev/ajoy0"

STATUS:

2014-12-04:

- Without ADC DMA support, it is not possible to sample both X and Y
  with a single ADC.  Right now, only one axis is being converted.

- There is conflicts with some of the Arduino data pins and the
  default USART1 configuration.  I am currently running with USART1
  but with CONFIG_NUCLEO_F401RE_AJOY_MINBUTTONS to eliminate the
  conflict.

- Current showstopper: I appear to be getting infinite interrupts as
  soon as joystick button interrupts are enabled.

Configurations
==============

f401-nsh:
---------

Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at apps/examples/nsh for the
Nucleo-F401RE board.  The Configuration enables the serial interfaces
on UART2.  Support for builtin applications is enabled, but in the base
configuration no builtin applications are selected (see NOTES below).

NOTES:

1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
   change this configuration using that tool, you should:

   a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
      see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

   b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.
          
2. By default, this configuration uses the ARM EABI toolchain
   for Linux.  That can easily be reconfigured, of course.:

       CONFIG_HOST_LINUX=y                     : Builds under Linux
       CONFIG_ARM_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABI=y      : GNU EABI toolchain for Linux

3. Although the default console is USART2 (which would correspond to
   the Virtual COM port) I have done all testing with the console
   device configured for USART1 (see instruction above under "Serial
   Consoles).  I have been using a TTL-to-RS-232 converter connected
   as shown below::

       Nucleo CN10 STM32F4x1RE
       ----------- ------------
       Pin 21 PA9  USART1_RX   *Warning you make need to reverse RX/TX on
       Pin 33 PA10 USART1_TX    some RS-232 converters
       Pin 20 GND
       Pin 8  U5V

f411-nsh
--------

This configuration is the same as the f401-nsh configuration, except
that it is configured to support the Nucleo-F411RE.
