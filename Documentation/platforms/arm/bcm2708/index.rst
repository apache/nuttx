==========================
Broadcom BCM2708 (removed)
==========================

Very basic support for the Broadcom BCM2708 was released with NuttX-7.23.

Raspberry Pi Zero. This support was provided for the Raspberry Pi Zero
which is based on the BCM2835. Basic logic is in place but the port is
incomplete and completely untested as of the NuttX-7.23 released. Refer
to the NuttX board
`README <https://bitbucket.org/patacongo/obsoleted/src/master/nuttx/boards/pizero/README.txt>`__
file for further information.

**Obsoleted:**: Support for the Raspberry Pi Zero was never completed.
The incomplete port along with all support for the BCM2708 was removed
from the repository with the NuttX-7.28 release but can still be be
found in the *Obsoleted* repository.
