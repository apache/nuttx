ST STEVAL-ETH001V1
==================

This page discusses issues unique to NuttX configurations for the
STMicro STEVAL-ETH001V1 servo drive evaluation board.
The STEVAL-ETH001V1 board is based on the STM32F767ZI MCU (2Mbytes FLASH
and 512Kbytes of SRAM).

The boards features:

- Three-phase motor driver inverter based on STDRIVE101 gate driver and
  STH270N8F7-2 power MOSFET
- NETX90 network controller
- Operating supply voltage up to 48 V with a max. overvoltage robustness of 60 V
- Motor brake dissipative energy circuit
- Digital actuation section for industrial loads
- RS485 interface for digital encoder and host interface
