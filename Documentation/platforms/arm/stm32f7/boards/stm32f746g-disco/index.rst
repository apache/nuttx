Development Environment
=======================

The Development environments for the STM32F746G-DISCO board are identical
to the environments for other STM32F boards.  For full details on the
environment options and setup, see the README.txt file in the
boards/arm/stm32f7/stm32f746g-disco directory.

LEDs and Buttons
================

LEDs
----

The STM32F746G-DISCO board has numerous LEDs but only one, LD1 located
near the reset button, that can be controlled by software (LD2 is a power
indicator, LD3-6 indicate USB status, LD7 is controlled by the ST-Link).

LD1 is controlled by PI1 which is also the SPI2_SCK at the Arduino
interface.  One end of LD1 is grounded so a high output on PI1 will
illuminate the LED.

This LED is not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is defined.
In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in include/board.h
and src/stm32_leds.c. The LEDs are used to encode OS-related events as
follows:

    =================== ======================= ======
    SYMBOL              Meaning                 LD1
    =================== ======================= ======
    LED_STARTED         NuttX has been started  OFF
    LED_HEAPALLOCATE    Heap has been allocated OFF
    LED_IRQSENABLED     Interrupts enabled      OFF
    LED_STACKCREATED    Idle stack created      ON
    LED_INIRQ           In an interrupt         N/C
    LED_SIGNAL          In a signal handler     N/C
    LED_ASSERTION       An assertion failed     N/C
    LED_PANIC           The system has crashed  FLASH
    =================== ======================= ======

  Thus is LD1 is statically on, NuttX has successfully  booted and is,
  apparently, running normally.  If LD1 is flashing at approximately
  2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system has halted.

Buttons
-------

Pushbutton B1, labelled "User", is connected to GPIO PI11.  A high
value will be sensed when the button is depressed.

Serial Console
==============

The STM32F469G-DISCO uses USART1 connected to "Virtual COM", so when you
plug it on your computer it will be detected as a USB port (i.e. ttyACM0):

  ======  ========= =====
  V.COM   FUNCTION  GPIO
  ======  ========= =====
  RXD     USART1_RX PB7
  TXD     USART1_TX PA9
  ======  ========= =====

All you need to do after flashing NuttX on this board is use a serial
console tool (minicom, picocom, screen, hyperterminal, teraterm, putty,
etc ) configured to 115200 8n1.

Configurations
==============

Common Configuration Information
--------------------------------

Each STM32F746G-DISCO configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
can be selected as follow::

    tools/configure.sh stm32f746g-disco:<subdir>

Where <subdir> is one of the sub-directories listed below.

NOTES:

1. These configurations use the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
   change this configuration using that tool, you should:

   a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
      see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

   b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
      reconfiguration process.

2. By default, these configurations use the USART1 for the serial
   console.  Pins are configured to that RX/TX are available at
   pins D0 and D1 of the Arduion connectors.  This should be compatible
   with most RS-232 shields.

3. All of these configurations are set up to build under Windows using the
   "GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors" that is maintained by ARM
   (unless stated otherwise in the description of the configuration).

         https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm

   As of this writing (2015-03-11), full support is difficult to find
   for the Cortex-M7, but is supported by at least this release of
   the ARM GNU tools:

         https://launchpadlibrarian.net/209776344/release.txt

   hat toolchain selection can easily be reconfigured using
   'make menuconfig'.  Here are the relevant current settings:

   Build Setup::

         CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y               : Window environment
         CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y             : Cywin under Windows

   System Type -> Toolchain::

         CONFIG_ARM_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABI=y  : GNU ARM EABI toolchain

   NOTE: As of this writing, there are issues with using this tool at
   the -Os level of optimization.  This has not been proven to be a
   compiler issue (as least not one that might not be fixed with a
   well placed volatile qualifier).  However, in any event, it is
   recommend that you use not more that -O2 optimization.

Configuration Directories
-------------------------

nsh
---

Configures the NuttShell (NSH) located at apps/examples/nsh.  The
Configuration enables the serial interfaces on USART1.  Support for
built-in applications is enabled, but in the base configuration no
built-in applications are selected.

netnsh
------

This configuration is similar to the nsh but a lot more hardware
peripherals are enabled, in particular Ethernet, as well as networking
support.  It is similar to the stm32f769i-disco/netnsh
configuration. This configuration uses USART1 for the serial console.
USART1 is connected to the ST-link virtual com inside board.h to remove
the need of a extra serial connection to use this board.

lgvl
----

STM32F746G-DISCO LittlevGL demo example.

The LTDC is initialized during boot up.
This configuration uses USART1 for the serial console.
USART1 is connected to the ST-link virtual com inside board.h to remove
the need of a extra serial connection to use this board.
From the nsh command line execute the lvgldemo example::

      nsh> lvgldemo

The test will execute the calibration process and then run the
LittlevGL demo project.
