Porting STM32 F4 Drivers
------------------------

The STM32F746 is very similar to the STM32 F429 and many of the drivers
in the stm32/ directory could be ported here:  ADC, BBSRAM, CAN, DAC,
DMA2D, FLASH, I2C, IWDG, LSE, LSI, LTDC, OTGFS, OTGHS, PM, Quadrature
Encoder, RNG, RTCC, SDMMC (was SDIO), Timer/counters, and WWDG.

Many of these drivers would be ported very simply; many ports would just
be a matter of copying files and some seach-and-replacement.  Like:

1. Compare the two register definitions files; make sure that the STM32
   F4 peripheral is identical (or nearly identical) to the F7
   peripheral.  If so then,

2. Copy the register definition file from the stm32/chip directory to
   the stm32f7/chip directory, making name changes as appropriate and
   updating the driver for any minor register differences.

3. Copy the corresponding C  file (and possibly a matching .h file) from
   the stm32/ directory to the stm32f7/ directory again with naming
   changes and changes for any register differences.

4. Update the Make.defs file to include the new C file in the build.

For other files, particularly those that use DMA, the port will be
significantly more complex.  That is because the STM32F7 has a D-Cache
and, as a result, we need to exercise much more care to maintain cache
coherency.  There is a Wiki page discussing the issues of porting
drivers from the stm32/ to the stm32f7/ directories here:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NUTTX/Porting+Drivers+to+the+STM32+F7

Memory
------

- CONFIG_RAM_SIZE - Describes the installed DRAM (SRAM in this case)

- CONFIG_RAM_START - The start address of installed SRAM (SRAM1)

This configurations use only SRAM1 for data storage.  The heap includes
the remainder of SRAM1.  If CONFIG_MM_REGIONS=2, then SRAM2 will be
included in the heap.

DTCM SRAM is never included in the heap because it cannot be used for
DMA.  A DTCM allocator is available, however, so that DTCM can be
managed with dtcm_malloc(), dtcm_free(), etc.

In order to use FMC SRAM, the following additional things need to be
present in the NuttX configuration file:

- CONFIG_STM32F7_FMC_SRAM - Indicates that SRAM is available via the
  FMC (as opposed to an LCD or FLASH).

- CONFIG_HEAP2_BASE - The base address of the SRAM in the FMC address space (hex)

- CONFIG_HEAP2_SIZE - The size of the SRAM in the FMC address space (decimal)

- CONFIG_ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK - This architecture supports an interrupt
  stack. If defined, this symbol is the size of the interrupt
  stack in bytes.  If not defined, the user task stacks will be
  used during interrupt handling.

- CONFIG_ARCH_STACKDUMP - Do stack dumps after assertions

Clock
-----

- CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_STM32F7_CUSTOM_CLOCKCONFIG - Enables special STM32F7 clock
  configuration features.::

    CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_STM32F7_CUSTOM_CLOCKCONFIG=n

- CONFIG_ARCH_LOOPSPERMSEC - Must be calibrated for correct operation of delay loops

Timers
------

Timer devices may be used for different purposes.  One special purpose is
to generate modulated outputs for such things as motor control.  If CONFIG_STM32F7_TIMn
is defined (as above) then the following may also be defined to indicate that
the timer is intended to be used for pulsed output modulation, ADC conversion,
or DAC conversion. Note that ADC/DAC require two definition:  Not only do you have
to assign the timer (n) for used by the ADC or DAC, but then you also have to
configure which ADC or DAC (m) it is assigned to.:

- CONFIG_STM32F7_TIMn_PWM   Reserve timer n for use by PWM, n=1,..,14
- CONFIG_STM32F7_TIMn_ADC   Reserve timer n for use by ADC, n=1,..,14
- CONFIG_STM32F7_TIMn_ADCm  Reserve timer n to trigger ADCm, n=1,..,14, m=1,..,3
- CONFIG_STM32F7_TIMn_DAC   Reserve timer n for use by DAC, n=1,..,14
- CONFIG_STM32F7_TIMn_DACm  Reserve timer n to trigger DACm, n=1,..,14, m=1,..,2

For each timer that is enabled for PWM usage, we need the following additional
configuration settings:

- CONFIG_STM32F7_TIMx_CHANNEL - Specifies the timer output channel {1,..,4}

NOTE: The STM32 timers are each capable of generating different signals on
each of the four channels with different duty cycles.  That capability is
not supported by this driver:  Only one output channel per timer.

JTAG

  CONFIG_STM32F7F7_CAN2 must also be defined)

FPU
===

FPU Configuration Options
-------------------------

There are two version of the FPU support built into the STM32 port.

1. Non-Lazy Floating Point Register Save

   In this configuration floating point register save and restore is
   implemented on interrupt entry and return, respectively.  In this
   case, you may use floating point operations for interrupt handling
   logic if necessary.  This FPU behavior logic is enabled by default
   with::

     CONFIG_ARCH_FPU=y

2. Lazy Floating Point Register Save.

   An alternative mplementation only saves and restores FPU registers only
   on context switches.  This means: (1) floating point registers are not
   stored on each context switch and, hence, possibly better interrupt
   performance.  But, (2) since floating point registers are not saved,
   you cannot use floating point operations within interrupt handlers.

   This logic can be enabled by simply adding the following to your .config
   file::

     CONFIG_ARCH_FPU=y

SPI Test
========

Available for some Nucleo boards.

The builtin SPI test facility can be enabled with the following settings::

    +CONFIG_STM32F7_SPI=y
    +CONFIG_STM32F7_SPI1=y
    +CONFIG_STM32F7_SPI2=y
    +CONFIG_STM32F7_SPI3=y

Development Environment
=======================

Either Linux or Cygwin on Windows can be used for the development environment.
The source has been built only using the GNU toolchain (see below).  Other
toolchains will likely cause problems.

All testing has been conducted using the GNU toolchain from ARM for Linux.
found here https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/4.9/4.9-2015-q3-update/+download/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q3-20150921-linux.tar.bz2

If you change the default toolchain, then you may also have to modify the
PATH environment variable to include the path to the toolchain binaries.

IDEs
====

NuttX is built using command-line make.  It can be used with an IDE, but some
effort will be required to create the project.

Makefile Build
--------------

Under Eclipse, it is pretty easy to set up an "empty makefile project" and
simply use the NuttX makefile to build the system.  That is almost for free
under Linux.  Under Windows, you will need to set up the "Cygwin GCC" empty
makefile project in order to work with Windows (Google for "Eclipse Cygwin" -
there is a lot of help on the internet).

Basic configuration & build steps
==================================

A GNU GCC-based toolchain is assumed.  The PATH environment variable should
be modified to point to the correct path to the Cortex-M7 GCC toolchain (if
different from the default in your PATH variable).

- Configures nuttx creating .config file in the nuttx directory.::

     $ tools/configure.sh nucleo-f746zg:nsh

- Refreshes the .config file with the latest available configurations.::

     $ make oldconfig

- Select the features you want in the build.::

     $ make menuconfig

- Builds NuttX with the features you selected.::

     $ make
