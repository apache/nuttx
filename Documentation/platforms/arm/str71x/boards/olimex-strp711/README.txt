Development Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Either Linux or Cygwin on Windows can be used for the development environment.
  The source has been built only using the GNU toolchain (see below).  Other
  toolchains will likely cause problems.

GNU Toolchain Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The NuttX make system has been modified to support the following different
  toolchain options.

  1. The NuttX buildroot Toolchain (see below),
  2. The ARM EABI GNU toolchain, or
  3. The devkitARM GNU toolchain.

  All testing has been conducted using the NuttX buildroot toolchain.  To use
  the CodeSourcery or devkitARM GNU toolchain, you simply need to build the
  system as follows:

     make                         # Will build for the NuttX buildroot toolchain
     make CROSSDEV=arm-eabi-      # Will build for the devkitARM toolchain
     make CROSSDEV=arm-none-eabi- # Will build for the ARM EABI GCC toolchain
     make CROSSDEV=arm-nuttx-elf- # Will build for the NuttX buildroot toolchain

  Of course, hard coding this CROSS_COMPILE value in Make.defs file will save
  some repetitive typing.

  NOTE: the CodeSourcery and devkitARM toolchains are Windows native toolchains.
  The NuttX buildroot toolchain is a Cygwin toolchain.  There are several limitations
  to using a Windows based toolchain in a Cygwin environment.  The three biggest are:

  1. The Windows toolchain cannot follow Cygwin paths.  Path conversions are
     performed automatically in the Cygwin makefiles using the 'cygpath' utility
     but you might easily find some new path problems.  If so, check out 'cygpath -w'

  2. Windows toolchains cannot follow Cygwin symbolic links.  Many symbolic links
     are used in NuttX (e.g., include/arch).  The make system works around these
     problems for the Windows tools by copying directories instead of linking them.
     But this can also cause some confusion for you:  For example, you may edit
     a file in a "linked" directory and find that your changes had no effect.
     That is because you are building the copy of the file in the "fake" symbolic
     directory.  If you use a Windows toolchain, you should get in the habit of
     making like this:

       make clean_context; make CROSSDEV=arm-none-eabi-

     An alias in your .bashrc file might make that less painful.

  NOTE 1: The CodeSourcery toolchain (2009q1) may not work with default optimization
  level of -Os (See Make.defs).  It will work with -O0, -O1, or -O2, but not with
  -Os.

  NOTE 2: The devkitARM toolchain includes a version of MSYS make.  Make sure that
  the paths to Cygwin's /bin and /usr/bin directories appear BEFORE the devkitARM
  path or will get the wrong version of make.

NuttX buildroot Toolchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  A GNU GCC-based toolchain is assumed.  The PATH environment variable should
  be modified to point to the correct path to the ARM toolchain (if
  different from the default).

  If you have no ARM toolchain, one can be downloaded from the NuttX
  Bitbucket download site (https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/buildroot/downloads/).

  1. You must have already configured NuttX in <some-dir>nuttx.

     tools/configure.sh olimex-strp711:<sub-dir>

  2. Download the latest buildroot package into <some-dir>

  3. unpack

  4. cd <some-dir>/buildroot

  5. cp boards/arm-defconfig .config
     or
     cp boards/arm7tdmi-defconfig-4.3.3 .config  (Last tested with this toolchain)

  6. make oldconfig

  7. make

  8. Make sure that the PATH variable includes the path to the newly built
     binaries.

Linux OpenOCD with Wiggler JTAG
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a debug environment, I am using OpenOCD with a Wiggler-clone JTAG interface.  The
following steps worked for me with a 20081028 OpenOCD snapshot.

GENERAL STEPS:

1. Check out OpenOCD

    svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/openocd/trunk openocd

2. Build OpenOCD

  Read the INSTALL file from the files you just downloaded.  You probably just need
  to run:

    ./bootstrap

  Then configure OpenOCD using the configure script created by ./bootstrap.

    ./configure --enable-parport

  Build OpenOCD with:

    make

  Install OpenOCD.  Since we used the default configuration the code will be
  installed at /usr/local/bin/openocd. Other files will be installed at
  /usr/local/lib/openocd (configuration files, scripts, etc.) and /usr/local/share/info
  (online documentation accessible via 'info openocd').  You need root privileges
  to do the following:

    make install.

3. Setup

  OpenOCD reads its configuration from the file openocd.cfg in the current directory
  when started.  You have two different options:

  * Create a symbolic link named openocd.cfg to one of the configuration files in
    /usr/local/lib/openocd, or

  * Use a custom configuration file specified with the ‘-f <conf.file>’ command line
    switch opeion when starting OpenOCD.

  For the STR-P711, I have included bash scripts in the scripts sub-directory.

4. Running OpenOCD

  Make sure the ARM7TDMI board is powered and the JTAG cable is connected

  Run 'src/openocd -d' (might be required to be root) and check for any errors
  reported. The '-d' option enables debugging info.

5. Telnet interface

  telnet into port 4444 to get a command interface: 'telnet localhost 4444'

6. GDB

  start arm-nuttx-elf-gdb
  type 'file <executable.elf>' to load the executable
  type 'set debug remote 1' to enable tracing of gdb protocol (if required)
  type 'target remote localhost:3333' to connect to the target
  The same commands from the telnet interface can now be accessed through the
  'monitor' command, e.g. 'monitor help'

Windows OpenOCD will Olimex JTAG
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  I have been using the Olimex ARM-USB-OCD JTAG debugger with the STR-P711
  (http://www.olimex.com).  The OpenOCD configuration file is here:
  scripts/oocd_ft2xx.cfg.  There is also a script on the scripts/ directory that
  I used to start the OpenOCD daemon on my system called oocd.sh.  That
  script would probably require some modifications to work in another
  environment:

    - possibly the value of OPENOCD_PATH
    - If you are working under Linux you will need to change any
      occurrences of `cygpath -w blablabla` to just blablabla

  If you have $PATH and other environment variables set up, then you should
  be able to start the OpenOCD daemon like:

    oocd.sh

  To use the Windows Olimex USB JTAG (or 'oocd.sh pp' to use the Wriggler
  JTAG) where it is assumed that you are executing oocd.sh from the top level
  level NuttX directory.

  Once the OpenOCD daemon has been started, you can connect to it via
  GDB using the following GDB command:

   arm-nuttx-elf-gdb
   (gdb) target remote localhost:3333

  And you can load the NuttX ELF file into FLASH:

   (gdb) load nuttx

  (There are also some files in the scripts/ directory that I used to
  get OpenOCD working with a Wriggler clone... I never got that stuff
  working).

MMC/SD Slot
^^^^^^^^^^^

  ---          9     DAT2/RES   (Pulled up)

  P1.10/USBCLK 10/14 WP         P1.10 input
  P1.15/HTXD   13/15 CP         P1.15 input

  Use of SPI1 doesn't conflict with anything.  WP conflicts USB; CP conflicts
  with NTXD.

ENC28J60 Module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The ENC28J60 module does not come on the Olimex-STR-P711, but this describes
  how I have connected it.  NOTE that the ENC28J60 requires an external interrupt
  (XTI) pin.  The only easily accessible XTI pins are on SPI0/1 so you can't have
  both SPI0 and 1 together with this configuration.

  Module CON5     QFN ENC2860 Description
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  1  J8-1 NET CS   5  ~CS    Chip select input pin for SPI interface (active low)
  2     2 SCK      4  SCK    Clock in pin for SPI interface
  3     3 MOSI     3  SI     Data in pin for SPI interface
  4     4 MISO     2  SO     Data out pin for SPI interface
  5     5 GND      -- ---    ---
  10 J9-1 3V3      -- ---    ---
  9     2 WOL      1  ~WOL   Unicast WOL filter
  8     3 NET INT  28 ~INT   Interrupt output pin (active low)
  7     4 CLKOUT   27 CLKOUT Programmable clock output pin
  6     5 NET RST  6  ~RESET Active-low device Reset input

  For the Olimex STR-P711, the ENC28J60 module is placed on SPI0 and uses
  P0.3 for CS, P0.6 for an interrupt, and P0.4 as a reset:

  Module CON5     Olimex STR-P711 Connection
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  1  J8-1 NET CS   SPI0-2     P0.3 output P0.3/S0.SS/I1.SDA
  2     2 SCK      SPI0-5     SCLK0       P0.2/S0.SCLK/I1.SCL
  3     3 MOSI     SPI0-3     MOSI0       P0.0/S0.MOSI/U3.RX
  4     4 MISO     SPI0-4     MISO0       P0.1/S0.MISO/U3.TX
  5     5 GND      SPI0-1     GND
  10 J9-1 3V3      SPI0-6     3.3V
  9     2 WOL      NC
  8     3 NET INT  SPI1-5     P0.6 XTI 11 P0.6/S1.SCLK
  7     4 CLKOUT   NC
  6     5 NET RST  SPI1-4     P0.4 output P0.4/S1.MISO

  UART3, I2C cannot be used with SPI0.  The GPIOs selected for the ENC28J60
  interrupt conflict with TIM1.

  NOTE:  As of this writing, the ENC28J60 does not function on the board.
  The board just locks up when the ENC29J60 is powered.  Most likely,
  in sufficient current is provided via USB to power both the board and
  the ENC28J60 (And I don't have the correct wall wart to power the
  the board).

Common Configuration Notes:
---------------------------

  1. Each Olimex STRP711 configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
     can be selected as follow:

       tools/configure.sh olimex-strp711:<subdir>

     Where <subdir> is one of the configuration sub-directories described in
     the following paragraph.

  2. These configurations use the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
     change a configurations using that tool, you should:

     a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
        see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

     b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
        reconfiguration process.

  3. By default, all configurations assume the NuttX Buildroot toolchain
     under Linux (should work under Windows with Cygwin as well).  This
     is easily reconfigured:

        CONFIG_HOST_LINUX=y
        CONFIG_ARM_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT=y

Configuration Sub-Directories:
------------------------------

  nettest:
    This configuration directory may be used to enable networking using the
    an Microchip ENC28J60 SPI Ethernet module (see above for connection to
    STR-P711).

  nsh:
    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at examples/nsh.  The
    Configuration enables both the serial and telnetd NSH interfaces.
