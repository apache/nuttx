NXP LPC40xx
===========

The LPC40xx family is very similar to the LPC17xx family
except that it features a Cortex-M4F versus the LPC17xx's Cortex-M3.
Architectural support for the LPC40xx family was built on top of the
existing LPC17xx by jjlange in NuttX-7.31. With that architectural
support came support for two boards also contributed by jjlange:

**LX CPU**. Pavel Pisa add support for the PiKRON LX CPU board. This
board may be configured to use either the LPC4088 or the LPC1788.

**Driver Status.**
