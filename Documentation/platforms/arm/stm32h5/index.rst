ST STM32H5
==========

This is a port of the STM32H5 family.
The STM32H5 is a chip based on the ARM Cortex-M33.
Most code is adapted from legacy STM32 and STM32H7.

Development primarily using the Nucleo-H563ZI as of Feb 5th, 2025.
Therefore, at this time only the STM32H563 is truly supported. However,
much of the current support should work for all MCUs. Kconfig will need
updates to support MCUs besides the STM32H563.
