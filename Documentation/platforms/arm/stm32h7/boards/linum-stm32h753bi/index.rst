Each linum-stm32h753bi configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
can be selected as follow::

    tools/configure.sh linum-stm32h753bi:<subdir>

  Where <subdir> is one of the following:


Configuration Directories
-------------------------

nsh
---

Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at apps/examples/nsh. This
configuration enables a serial console on UART1.

modbus_slave
------------

Configures the ModBus RTU Slave located at apps/examples/modbus. This
configuration enables a RS485 on USART6.

After configuring the desired pins on menuconfig and wiring the RS485 converter, you
can enable the ModBus to respond to queries::

    nsh> modbus -e

In your pc you will be able to read the ModBus registers using an application like ``mbpoll``::

    $ mbpoll -a 10 -b 38400 -t 3 -r 1000 -c 4 /dev/ttyUSB1 -R
