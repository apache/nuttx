Each weact-stm32h743 configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
can be selected as follow::

  ./tools/configure.sh weact-stm32h743:<subdir>

Where <subdir> is one of the following:


Configuration Directories
-------------------------

nsh
---

Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at apps/examples/nsh. This
configuration enables a serial console on UART1.

usbnsh
------

Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at apps/examples/nsh. This
configuration enables a serial console over USB.

After flashing and reboot your board you should see in your dmesg logs::

       [ 2638.948089] usb 1-1.4: new full-speed USB device number 16 using xhci_hcd
       [ 2639.054432] usb 1-1.4: New USB device found, idVendor=0525, idProduct=a4a7, bcdDevice= 1.01
       [ 2639.054437] usb 1-1.4: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
