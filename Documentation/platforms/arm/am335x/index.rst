================

These following boards are based on the TI/Sitara
AM335x are supported by NuttX:

-  **Beaglebone Black**. A port of NuttX to the Beaglebone Black board
   was first released in NuttX-7.28. This port was contributed by Petro
   Karashchenko. This board is based on the TI/Sitara AM3358 Cortex-A8
   CPU running 1GHz.

   -  **NuttX-7.28**. This initial port in NuttX-7.28 is very sparse.
      While not ready for prodcution use, the Beaglebone Black port is
      functional and will be the basis for a more extensive development.
      Additional work in progress to extend this port and more capable
      is anticipated in NuttX-7.29.
   -  **NuttX-9.0** CAN support was added. Clock Configuration was
      added.
   -  **NuttX-7.31**. An LCD driver was added in NuttX-7.31.
