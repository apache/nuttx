   The PKE8721DAF development board.

The PKE8721DAF is a Realtek RTL8721Dx development board built around the
RTL8721DAF (QFN48, 4 MB NOR flash). NuttX runs on the KM4 application core —
an Arm Cortex-M55-compatible core running at up to 345 MHz. See the
:doc:`RTL8721Dx chip documentation <../../index>` for the full SoC
specifications and the vendor-SDK dependency.

Features
========

* RTL8721DAF: Arm Cortex-M55-compatible KM4 core up to 345 MHz, 512 KB SRAM,
  4 MB NOR flash
* Wi-Fi 4 dual-band (2.4 / 5 GHz) station and SoftAP
* SPI NOR flash (XIP)
* LOG-UART console

Supported in this NuttX port:

* NSH shell over the LOG-UART console
* littlefs persistent storage mounted at ``/data`` (a dedicated SPI NOR flash
  partition), backing the Wi-Fi key-value store
* Wi-Fi station and SoftAP through the ``wapi`` tool
* DHCP client (STA) and DHCP server (SoftAP)

Buttons and LEDs
================

This NuttX port does not wire any user buttons or LEDs.

Configurations
==============

Build and flash any of these per the :doc:`RTL8721Dx build instructions
<../../index>`; for the CMake build, source ``. tools/ameba/env.sh
pke8721daf`` first (the make build needs no sourcing).

.. code:: console

   $ ./tools/configure.sh pke8721daf:<config-name>

nsh
---

Networking-enabled NSH with littlefs at ``/data`` and the ``wapi`` Wi-Fi tool.
The console is the LOG-UART at 1500000 8N1 (the rate is configured by the
bootloader and inherited by NuttX). The Wi-Fi examples below are available from
this configuration.

Wi-Fi
=====

Station (connect to an AP)::

    nsh> wapi psk    wlan0 <password> 3
    nsh> wapi essid  wlan0 <ssid> 1
    nsh> renew wlan0

SoftAP (become an access point, with a DHCP server for clients)::

    nsh> wapi mode   wlan0 3
    nsh> wapi psk    wlan0 <password> 3
    nsh> wapi essid  wlan0 <ssid> 1
    nsh> ifconfig    wlan0 192.168.4.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
    nsh> dhcpd_start wlan0

Stop the SoftAP with ``wapi essid wlan0 <ssid> 0``.

License Exceptions
==================

This board depends on Realtek vendor code that is not part of NuttX and is
subject to its own license:

* The prebuilt Wi-Fi / Bluetooth firmware image and the Realtek ``ameba-rtos``
  SDK libraries/headers linked into the image. See the SDK's own license; the
  SDK is auto-fetched and is not redistributed in the NuttX tree.
