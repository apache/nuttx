Seeed Studio Xiao RP2040
========================

The `Seeed Studio Xiao RP2040 <https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-RP2040/>`_ is a general purpose board supplied by
Seeed Studio and it is compatible with the Raspberry Pi RP2040 ecosystem as they share the same RP2040 chip.

Features
========

* RP2040 microcontroller chip
* Dual-core ARM Cortex M0+ processor, flexible clock running up to 133 MHz
* 264KB of SRAM, and 2MB of onboard Flash memory
* 11 digital pins, 4 analog pins, 11 PWM Pins
* 1 I2C interface, 1 UART interface, 1 SPI interface, 1 SWD Bonding pad interface
* USB Type-C interface
* 1 user LED, 1 power LED, two LEDs for serial port downloading, 1 RGB LED
* 1 RESET button, 1 BOOT button

Serial Console
==============

By default a serial console appears on pins 6 (TX GPIO0) and pin 7
(RX GPIO1).  This console runs a 115200-8N1.
The board can be configured to use the USB connection as the serial console.

LEDs
====

There are 2 LEDs available for user:

- A RGB LED connected to GPIO16 (PIN_LED_G), GPIO17 (PIN_LED_R), GPIO25 (PIN_LED_B).
- A NeoPixel RGB LED connected to GPIO11 (NEOPIXEL_POWER) and GPIO12 (PIN_NEOPIXEL).

Buttons
=======

There are 2 buttons available:

A RESET button and a BOOT button, which if held down when power is first
applied to the board, will cause the RP2040 to boot into programming
mode and appear as a storage device to a computer connected via USB.
Saving a .UF2 file to this device will replace the Flash ROM contents
on the RP2040.


Pin Mapping
===========
Pads numbered anticlockwise from USB connector.

Power Supply
============
For general I/O pins:

Working voltage of MCU is 3.3V. Voltage input connected to general I/O pins
may cause chip damage if it' higher than 3.3V.

For power supply pins:

The built-in DC-DC converter circuit able to change 5V voltage into 3.3V allows
to power the device with a 5V supply via VIN-PIN and via the USB connector.

Configurations
==============
