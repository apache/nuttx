Serial Console
==============

A `PinePhone Serial Debug Cable <https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone#Serial_console>`_
is required to run NuttX on PinePhone.

On PinePhone, set the `Privacy Switch 6 (Headphone) <https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone#Privacy_switch_configuration>`_
to **Off**.

Connect PinePhone to our computer with the Serial Debug Cable.
On our computer, start a Serial Terminal and connect to the USB Serial Port
at **115.2 kbps**.

NuttX will appear in the Serial Console when it boots on PinePhone.

ARM64 Toolchain
===============

Before building NuttX for PinePhone, download the ARM64 Toolchain for
**AArch64 Bare-Metal Target** ``aarch64-none-elf`` from
`Arm GNU Toolchain Downloads <https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads>`_.
(Skip the section for Beta Releases)

Add the downloaded toolchain ``gcc-arm-...-aarch64-none-elf/bin``
to the ``PATH`` Environment Variable.

Check the ARM64 Toolchain:

.. code:: console

   $ aarch64-none-elf-gcc -v

Building
========

To build NuttX for PinePhone, :doc:`install the prerequisites </quickstart/install>` and
:doc:`clone the git repositories </quickstart/install>` for ``nuttx`` and ``apps``.

Configure the NuttX project and build the project:

.. code:: console

   $ cd nuttx
   $ tools/configure.sh pinephone:nsh
   $ make
   $ cp nuttx.bin Image
   $ rm -f Image.gz
   $ gzip Image

This produces the file ``Image.gz``, which will be copied to PinePhone in the next step.

If the build fails with the error ``token "@" is not valid in preprocessor``,
`apply this patch <https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/pull/7284/commits/518b0eb31cb66f25b590ae9a79ab16c319b96b94#diff-12291efd8a0ded1bc38bad733d99e4840ae5112b465c04287f91ba5169612c73>`_
to ``gcc-arm-none-eabi/arm-none-eabi/include/_newlib_version.h``
in the ARM64 Toolchain.

Booting
=======

NuttX boots on PinePhone via a microSD Card. To prepare the microSD Card, download the
**PinePhone Jumpdrive Image** ``pine64-pinephone.img.xz`` from
`dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive <https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive/releases>`_.

Write the downloaded image to a microSD Card with
`Balena Etcher <https://www.balena.io/etcher/>`_.

Copy the file ``Image.gz`` from the previous section
and overwrite the file on the microSD Card.

Check that PinePhone is connected to our computer via a
`Serial Debug Cable <https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone#Serial_console>`_ at 115.2 kbps.
`Privacy Switch 6 (Headphone) <https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone#Privacy_switch_configuration>`_
should be set to **Off**.

Insert the microSD Card into PinePhone and power up PinePhone.
NuttX boots on PinePhone and NuttShell (nsh) appears in the Serial Console.

To see the available commands in NuttShell:

.. code:: console

   $ help
