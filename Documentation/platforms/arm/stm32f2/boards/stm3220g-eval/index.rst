ST STM3220G-EVAL
================

This page discusses issues unique to NuttX configurations for the
STMicro STM3220G-EVAL development board.

Ethernet
========

The Ethernet driver is configured to use the MII interface:

Board Jumper Settings:

    Jumper  Description
    ======= ============
    JP8     To enable MII, JP8 should not be fitted.
    JP6     2-3: Enable MII interface mode
    JP5     2-3: Provide 25 MHz clock for MII or 50 MHz clock for RMII by MCO at PA8
    SB1     Not used with MII
    ======= ============

LEDs
====

The STM3220G-EVAL board has four LEDs labeled LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 on the
board.. These LEDs are not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
include/board.h and src/up_leds.c. The LEDs are used to encode OS-related\
events as follows:

    ===================  ======================= ======= ======= ======= ======
    SYMBOL               Meaning                 LED1[1] LED2    LED3    LED4
    ===================  ======================= ======= ======= ======= ======
    LED_STARTED          NuttX has been started  ON      OFF     OFF     OFF
    LED_HEAPALLOCATE     Heap has been allocated OFF     ON      OFF     OFF
    LED_IRQSENABLED      Interrupts enabled      ON      ON      OFF     OFF
    LED_STACKCREATED     Idle stack created      OFF     OFF     ON      OFF
    LED_INIRQ            In an interrupt[2]      ON      N/C     N/C     OFF
    LED_SIGNAL           In a signal handler[3]  N/C     ON      N/C     OFF
    LED_ASSERTION        An assertion failed     ON      ON      N/C     OFF
    LED_PANIC            The system has crashed  N/C     N/C     N/C     ON
    LED_IDLE             STM32 is is sleep mode 
    ===================  ======================= ======= ======= ======= ======

[1] If LED1, LED2, LED3 are statically on, then NuttX probably failed to boot
and these LEDs will give you some indication of where the failure was

[2] The normal state is LED3 ON and LED1 faintly glowing.  This faint glow
is because of timer interrupts that result in the LED being illuminated
on a small proportion of the time.

[3] LED2 may also flicker normally if signals are processed.

PWM
===

The STM3220G-Eval has no real on-board PWM devices, but the board can be
configured to output a pulse train using timer output pins.  The following
pins have been use to generate PWM output (see board.h for some other
candidates):

TIM4 CH2.  Pin PD13 is used by the FSMC (FSMC_A18) and is also connected
to the Motor Control Connector (CN5) just for this purpose.  If FSMC is
not enabled, then FSMC_A18 will not be used (and will be tri-stated from
the LCD).

CONFIGURATION::

    CONFIG_STM32_TIM4=y
    CONFIG_PWM=n
    CONFIG_PWM_PULSECOUNT=n
    CONFIG_STM32_TIM4_PWM=y
    CONFIG_STM32_TIM4_CHANNEL=2

ACCESS::

    Daughterboard Extension Connector, CN3, pin 32
    Ground is available on CN3, pin1

NOTE: TIM4 hardware will not support pulse counting.

TIM8 CH4:  Pin PC9 is used by the microSD card (MicroSDCard_D1) and I2S
(I2S_CKIN) but can be completely disconnected from both by opening JP16.

CONFIGURATION::

    CONFIG_STM32_TIM8=y
    CONFIG_PWM=n
    CONFIG_PWM_PULSECOUNT=y
    CONFIG_STM32_TIM8_PWM=y
    CONFIG_STM32_TIM8_CHANNEL=4

ACCESS::

    Daughterboard Extension Connector, CN3, pin 17
    Ground is available on CN3, pin1

CAN
===

Connector 10 (CN10) is DB-9 male connector that can be used with CAN1 or CAN2.::

  JP10 connects CAN1_RX or CAN2_RX to the CAN transceiver
  JP3 connects CAN1_TX or CAN2_TX to the CAN transceiver

CAN signals are then available on CN10 pins::

  CN10 Pin 7 = CANH
  CN10 Pin 2 = CANL

Mapping to STM32 GPIO pins::

  PD0   = FSMC_D2 & CAN1_RX
  PD1   = FSMC_D3 & CAN1_TX
  PB13  = ULPI_D6 & CAN2_TX
  PB5   = ULPI_D7 & CAN2_RX

FSMC SRAM
=========

On-board SRAM
-------------

A 16 Mbit SRAM is connected to the STM32F407IGH6 FSMC bus which shares the same
I/Os with the CAN1 bus. Jumper settings::

  JP1: Connect PE4 to SRAM as A20
  JP2: onnect PE3 to SRAM as A19

JP3 and JP10 must not be fitted for SRAM and LCD application.  JP3 and JP10
select CAN1 or CAN2 if fitted; neither if not fitted.

The on-board SRAM can be configured by setting::

  CONFIG_STM32_FSMC=y
  CONFIG_STM32_EXTERNAL_RAM=y
  CONFIG_HEAP2_BASE=0x64000000
  CONFIG_HEAP2_SIZE=2097152
  CONFIG_MM_REGIONS=2

SRAM Configurations
-------------------
There are 2 possible SRAM configurations::

  Configuration 1. System SRAM (only)
                   CONFIG_MM_REGIONS == 1
  Configuration 2. System SRAM and FSMC SRAM
                   CONFIG_MM_REGIONS == 2
                   CONFIG_STM32_EXTERNAL_RAM defined

I/O Expanders
=============

The STM3220G-EVAL has two STMPE811QTR I/O expanders on board both connected to
the STM32 via I2C1.  They share a common interrupt line: PI2.

Configurations
==============

Each STM3220G-EVAL configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
can be selected as follow::

    tools/configure.sh stm3220g-eval:<subdir>

Where <subdir> is one of the following:

dhcpd:
------

This builds the DHCP server using the apps/examples/dhcpd application
(for execution from FLASH.) See apps/examples/README.txt for information
about the dhcpd example.

NOTES:

1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
   change this configurations using that tool, you should:

   a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
      see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

   b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
      reconfiguration process.

2. The server address is 10.0.0.1 and it serves IP addresses in the range
   10.0.0.2 through 10.0.0.17 (all of which, of course, are configurable).

3. Default build environment (also easily reconfigured)::

      CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y
      CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y
      CONFIG_ARM_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABI=y

nettest:
--------

This configuration directory may be used to verify networking performance
using the STM32's Ethernet controller. It uses apps/examples/nettest to exercise the
TCP/IP network.::

    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NETTEST_SERVER=n                       : Target is configured as the client
    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NETTEST_PERFORMANCE=y                  : Only network performance is verified.
    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NETTEST_IPADDR=(10<<24|0<<16|0<<8|2)   : Target side is IP: 10.0.0.2
    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NETTEST_DRIPADDR=(10<<24|0<<16|0<<8|1) : Host side is IP: 10.0.0.1
    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NETTEST_CLIENTIP=(10<<24|0<<16|0<<8|1) : Server address used by which ever is client.

NOTES:

1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
   change this configuration using that tool, you should:

   a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
      see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

   b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
      reconfiguration process.

2. Default build environment::

        CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y                    : Windows
        CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y                  : Under Cygwin
        CONFIG_ARM_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABI=y       : GNU EABI toolchain for Windows

       Than can, of course, be easily changes by reconfiguring per Note 1.

nsh:
----

Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at apps/examples/nsh.  The
Configuration enables both the serial and telnet NSH interfaces.::

    CONFIG_ARM_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABI=y            : GNU EABI toolchain for Windows
    CONFIG_NSH_DHCPC=n                            : DHCP is disabled
    CONFIG_NSH_IPADDR=(192<<24|168<<16|13<<8|161) : Target IP address 192.168.8.161
    CONFIG_NSH_DRIPADDR=(192<<24|168<<16|13<<8|1) : Host IP address 192.168.8.1

NOTES:

1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
   change this configurations using that tool, you should:

   a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
      see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

   b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
      reconfiguration process.
          
2. This example assumes that a network is connected.  During its
   initialization, it will try to negotiate the link speed.  If you have
   no network connected when you reset the board, there will be a long
   delay (maybe 30 seconds?) before anything happens.  That is the timeout
   before the networking finally gives up and decides that no network is
   available.

3. This example supports the ADC test (apps/examples/adc) but this must
   be manually enabled by selecting::

       CONFIG_ADC=y             : Enable the generic ADC infrastructure
       CONFIG_STM32_ADC3=y      : Enable ADC3
       CONFIG_STM32_TIM1=y      : Enable Timer 1
       CONFIG_STM32_TIM1_ADC=y  : Indicate that timer 1 will be used to trigger an ADC
       CONFIG_STM32_TIM1_ADC3=y : Assign timer 1 to drive ADC3 sampling
       CONFIG_STM32_ADC3_SAMPLE_FREQUENCY=100 : Select a sampling frequency

    See also apps/examples/README.txt

    General debug for analog devices (ADC/DAC)::

       CONFIG_DEBUG_ANALOG

4. This example supports the PWM test (apps/examples/pwm) but this must
   be manually enabled by selecting eeither::

       CONFIG_PWM=y                : Enable the generic PWM infrastructure
       CONFIG_PWM_PULSECOUNT=n     : Disable to support for TIM1/8 pulse counts
       CONFIG_STM32_TIM4=y         : Enable TIM4
       CONFIG_STM32_TIM4_PWM=y     : Use TIM4 to generate PWM output
       CONFIG_STM32_TIM4_CHANNEL=2 : Select output on TIM4, channel 2

   If CONFIG_STM32_FSMC is disabled, output will appear on CN3, pin 32.
   Ground is available on CN3, pin1.

   Or..::

       CONFIG_PWM=y                : Enable the generic PWM infrastructure
       CONFIG_PWM_PULSECOUNT=y     : Enable to support for TIM1/8 pulse counts
       CONFIG_STM32_TIM8=y         : Enable TIM8
       CONFIG_STM32_TIM8_PWM=y     : Use TIM8 to generate PWM output
       CONFIG_STM32_TIM8_CHANNEL=4 : Select output on TIM8, channel 4

   If CONFIG_STM32_FSMC is disabled, output will appear on CN3, pin 17
   Ground is available on CN23 pin1.

   See also include/board.h and apps/examples/README.txt

   Special PWM-only debug options::

       CONFIG_DEBUG_PWM_INFO

5. This example supports the CAN loopback test (apps/examples/can) but this
must be manually enabled by selecting::

       CONFIG_CAN=y             : Enable the generic CAN infrastructure
       CONFIG_CAN_EXTID=y or n  : Enable to support extended ID frames
       CONFIG_STM32_CAN1=y      : Enable CAN1
       CONFIG_CAN_LOOPBACK=y    : Enable CAN loopback mode

    See also apps/examples/README.txt

    Special CAN-only debug options::

       CONFIG_DEBUG_CAN_INFO
       CONFIG_STM32_CAN_REGDEBUG

6. This example can support an FTP client.  In order to build in FTP client
support simply reconfigure NuttX, adding::

       CONFIG_NETUTILS_FTPC=y
       CONFIG_EXAMPLES_FTPC=y

7. This example can support an FTP server.  In order to build in FTP server
support simply add the following lines in the NuttX configuration file::

       CONFIG_NETUTILS_FTPD=y
       CONFIG_EXAMPLES_FTPD=y

8. This example supports the watchdog timer test (apps/examples/watchdog)
but this must be manually enabled by selecting::

       CONFIG_WATCHDOG=y         : Enables watchdog timer driver support
       CONFIG_STM32_WWDG=y       : Enables the WWDG timer facility, OR
       CONFIG_STM32_IWDG=y       : Enables the IWDG timer facility (but not both)

  The WWDG watchdog is driven off the (fast) 42MHz PCLK1 and, as result,
  has a maximum timeout value of 49 milliseconds.  For WWDG watchdog, you
  should also add the following to the configuration file::

       CONFIG_EXAMPLES_WATCHDOG_PINGDELAY=20
       CONFIG_EXAMPLES_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT=49

  The IWDG timer has a range of about 35 seconds and should not be an issue.

9. Adding LCD and graphics support:

Enable the application configurations that you want to use.  As examples::

       CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NX=y      : Pick one or more
       CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NXHELLO=y :
       CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NXIMAGE=y :
       CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NXLINES=y :

  defconfig (nuttx/.config)::

       CONFIG_STM32_FSMC=y       : FSMC support is required for the LCD
       CONFIG_NX=y               : Enable graphics support
       CONFIG_MM_REGIONS=2       : When FSMC is enabled, so is the on-board SRAM memory region

10. USB OTG FS Device or Host Support::

       CONFIG_USBDEV             : Enable USB device support, OR
       CONFIG_USBHOST            : Enable USB host support (but not both)

       CONFIG_STM32_OTGFS        : Enable the STM32 USB OTG FS block
       CONFIG_STM32_SYSCFG       : Needed for all USB OTF FS support

       CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE    : Worker thread support is required for the mass
                                   storage class (both host and device).
       CONFIG_NSH_ARCHINIT       : Architecture specific USB initialization
                                   is needed

11. This configuration requires that jumper JP22 be set to enable RS-232 operation.

nsh2:
-----

This is an alternative NSH configuration.  One limitation of the STM3220G-EVAL
board is that you cannot have both a UART-based NSH console and SDIO support.
The nsh2 differs from the nsh configuration in the following ways::

    -CONFIG_STM32_USART3=y      : USART3 is disabled
    +CONFIG_STM32_USART3=n

    -CONFIG_STM32_SDIO=n        : SDIO is enabled
    +CONFIG_STM32_SDIO=y

Logically, these are the only differences:  This configuration has SDIO (and
the SD card) enabled and the serial console disabled. There is ONLY a
Telnet console!.

There are some special settings to make life with only a Telnet::

    CONFIG_RAMLOG=y - Enable the RAM-based logging feature.
    CONFIG_CONSOLE_SYSLOG=y - Use the RAM logger as the default console.
      This means that any console output from non-Telnet threads will
      go into the circular buffer in RAM.
    CONFIG_RAMLOG_SYSLOG - This enables the RAM-based logger as the
      system logger.  This means that (1) in addition to the console
      output from other tasks, ALL of the debug output will also to
      to the circular buffer in RAM, and (2) NSH will now support a
      command called 'dmesg' that can be used to dump the RAM log.

There are a few other configuration differences as necessary to support
this different device configuration. Just the do the 'diff' if you are
curious.

NOTES:

1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
   change this configurations using that tool, you should:

   a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
      see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

   b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
      reconfiguration process.

2. See the notes for the nsh configuration.  Most also apply to the nsh2
   configuration.

3. RS-232 is disabled, but Telnet is still available for use as a console.
   Since RS-232 and SDIO use the same pins (one controlled by JP22), RS232
   and SDIO cannot be used concurrently.

4. This configuration requires that jumper JP22 be set to enable SDIO
   operation.  To enable MicroSD Card, which shares same I/Os with RS-232,
   JP22 is not fitted.

5. In order to use SDIO without overruns, DMA must be used.

6. Another SDIO/DMA issue.  This one is probably a software bug.  This is
   the bug as stated in the TODO list:

   "If you use a large I/O buffer to access the file system, then the
   MMCSD driver will perform multiple block SD transfers.  With DMA
   ON, this seems to result in CRC errors detected by the hardware
   during the transfer.  Workaround:  CONFIG_MMCSD_MULTIBLOCK_LIMIT=1"

   For this reason, CONFIG_MMCSD_MULTIBLOCK_LIMIT=1 appears in the defconfig
   file.

7. Another DMA-related concern.  I see this statement in the reference
   manual:  "The burst configuration has to be selected in order to respect
   the AHB protocol, where bursts must not cross the 1 KB address boundary
   because the minimum address space that can be allocated to a single slave
   is 1 KB. This means that the 1 KB address boundary should not be crossed
   by a burst block transfer, otherwise an AHB error would be generated,
   that is not reported by the DMA registers."

   There is nothing in the DMA driver to prevent this now.

nxwm:
-----

This is a special configuration setup for the NxWM window manager
UnitTest.  The NxWM window manager can be found here::

      apps/graphics/NxWidgets/nxwm

The NxWM unit test can be found at::

      apps/graphics/NxWidgets/UnitTests/nxwm

NOTES:

1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
   change this configuration using that tool, you should:

   a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
      see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

   b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
      reconfiguration process.

2. This configuration is currently set up to build under Cygwin on
   a Windows machine using the ARM EABI GCC Windows toolchain.
   That configuration can be easy changed as described in Note 1.

telnetd:
--------

A simple test of the Telnet daemon(see apps/netutils/README.txt,
apps/examples/README.txt, and apps/examples/telnetd).  This is
the same daemon that is used in the nsh configuration so if you
use NSH, then you don't care about this.  This test is good for
testing the Telnet daemon only because it works in a simpler
environment than does the nsh configuration.

NOTES:

1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
   change this configurations using that tool, you should:

   a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
      see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

   b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
      reconfiguration process.

3. Default build environment (easily reconfigured)::

      CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y
      CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y
      CONFIG_ARM_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABI=y
