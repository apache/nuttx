Zilog Z180

**P112**. The P112 is a hobbyist single board computer based on a 16MHz
Z80182 with up to 1MB of memory, serial, parallel and diskette IO, and
realtime clock, in a 3.5-inch drive form factor. The P112 computer
originated as a commercial product of "D-X Designs Pty Ltd"[ of
Australia.

Dave Brooks was successfully funded through Kickstarter for and another
run of P112 boards in November of 2012. In addition Terry Gulczynski
makes additional P112 derivative hobbyist home brew computers.

**STATUS:** Most of the NuttX is in port for both the Z80182 and for the
P112 board. Boards from Kickstarter project will not be available,
however, until the third quarter of 2013. So it will be some time before
this port is verified on hardware. Refer to the NuttX board

file for further information.
