Single CPU Critical Sections
============================

OS Interfaces
-------------

Before we talk about SMP Critical Sections let's first review the internal OS
interfaces avaiable and what they do in the single CPU case:

* ``up_irq_save()`` (and its companion, ``up_irq_restore()``). These simple
  interfaces just enable and disable interrupts globally. This is the simplest
  way to establish a critical section in the single CPU case. It does have
  side-effects to real-time behavior as discussed elsewhere.

* ``up_irq_save()`` should never be called directly, however. Instead, the wrapper
  macros enter_critical_section() (and its companion ``leave_critical_section()``)
  or ``spin_lock_irqsave()`` (and ``spin_unlock_irqrestore()``) should be used.
  In the single CPU case, these macros are defined to be simply ``up_irq_save()``
  (or ``up_irq_save()``). Rather than being called directly, they should always
  be called indirectly through these macros so that the code will function in the
  SMP environment as well.

* Finally, there is ``sched_lock()`` (and ``sched_unlock()``) that disable (and
  enable) pre-emption. That is, ``sched_lock()`` will lock your kernel thread in
  place and prevent other tasks from running. Interrupts are still enabled, but
  other tasks cannot run.


Using sched_lock() for Critical Sections â€“ **DON'T**
----------------------------------------------------

In the single CPU case, ``sched_lock()`` can do a pretty good job of establishing a
critical section too. After all, if no other tasks can run on the single CPU,
then that task has pretty much exclusive access to all resources (provided that
those resources are not shared with interrupt handlers). However, ``sched_lock()``
must never be used to establish a critical section because it does not work the
same way in the SMP case. In the SMP case, locking the scheduer does not provide
any kind of exclusive access to resources. Tasks running on other CPUs are still
free to do whatever they wish.

SMP Critical Sections
=====================

``up_irq_save()`` and ``up_irq_restore()``
------------------------------------------

As mentioned, ``up_irq_save()`` and ``up_irq_restore()`` should never be called
directly. That is because the behavior is different in multiple CPU systems. In
the multiple CPU case, these functions only enable (or disable) interrupts on the
local CPU. They have no effect on interrupts in the other CPUs and hence really
accomplish very little. Certainly they do not provide a critical section in any
sense.

``enter_critical_section()`` and ``leave_critical_section()``
-------------------------------------------------------------

**spinlocks**

In order to establish a critical section, we also need to employ spinlocks. Spins
locks are simply loops that execute in one processor. If processor A sets spinlock
x, then processor B would have to wait for the spinlock like:

.. code-block:: C

  while (test_and_set(x))
   {
   }

Where test and set is an atomic operation that sets the value of a memory location
but also returns its previous value. Here we are talking about atomic in terms of
memory bus operations: The testing and setting of the memory location must be atomic
with respect to other bus operations. Special hardware support of some kind is
necessary to implement ``test_and_set()`` logic.

When Task A released the lock x, Task B will successfully take the spinlock and
continue.

**Implementation**

Without going into the details of the implementation of ``enter_critical_section()``
suffice it to say that it (1) disables interrupts on the local CPU and (2) uses
spinlocks to assure exclusive access to a code sequence across all CPUs.

NOTE that a critical section is indeed created: While within the critical section,
the code does have exclusive access to the resource being protected. However the
behavior is really very different:

* In the single CPU case, disable interrupts stops all possible activity from any
  other task. The single CPU becomes single threaded and un-interruptible.
* In the SMP case, tasks continue to run on other CPUs. It is only when those other
  tasks attempt to enter a code sequence protected by the critical section that those
  tasks on other CPUs will be stopped. They will be stopped waiting on a spinlock.

``spin_lock_irqsave()`` and ``spin_unlock_irqrestore()``
--------------------------------------------------------

**Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC)**

ARM provides a special, optional sub-system called MPCore that provides
multi-core support. One MPCore component is the Generic Interrupt Controller
or GIC. The GIC supports 16 inter-processor interrupts and is a key component for
implementing SMP on those platforms. The are called Software Generated Interrupts
or SGIs.

One odd behavior of the GIC is that the SGIs cannot be disabled (at least not
using the standard ARM global interrupt disable logic). So disabling local
interrupts does not prevent these GIC interrupts.

This causes numerous complexities and significant overhead in establishing a
critical section.

**ARMv7-M NVIC**

The GIC is available in all recent ARM architectures. However, most embedded
ARM7-M multi-core CPUs just incorporate the inter-processor interrupts as a
normal interrupt that is mask-able via the NVIC (each CPU will have its own NVIC).

This means in those cases, the critical section logic can be greatly simplified.

**Implementation**

For the case of the GIC with no support for disabling interrupts,
``spin_lock_irqsave()`` and ``spin_unlock_irqstore()`` are equivalent to
``enter_critical_section()`` and ``leave_critical_section()``. In is only in the
case where inter-processor interrupts can be disabled that there is a difference.

In that case, ``spin_lock_irqsave()`` will disable local interrupts and take
a spinlock. This is really very simple and efficient implementation of a critical
section.

There are two important things to note, however:

* The logic within this critical section must never suspend! For example, if
  code were to call ``spin_lock_irqsave()`` then ``sleep()``, then the sleep
  would occur with the spinlock in the lock state and the whole system could
  be blocked. Rather, ``spin_lock_irqsave()`` can only be used with straight
  line code.

* This is a different critical section than the one established via
  ``enter_critical_section()``. Taking one critical section, does not prevent
  logic on another CPU from taking the other critical section and the result
  is that you make not have the protection that you think you have.

``sched_lock()`` and ``sched_unlock()``
---------------------------------------

Other than some details, the SMP ``sched_lock()`` works much like it does in
the single CPU case. Here are the caveats:

* As in the single CPU case, the case that calls ``sched_lock()`` is locked
  in place and cannot be suspected.

* However, tasks will continue to run on other CPUs so ``sched_lock()`` cannot
  be used as a critical section.

* Tasks on other CPUs are also locked in place. However, they may opt to suspend
  themselves at any time (say, via ``sleep()``). In that case, only the CPU's
  IDLE task will be permitted to run.
