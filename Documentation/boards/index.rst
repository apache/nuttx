  Include a full list of supported boards, organized by architecture / family / vendor.
  Each board should have its own entry, a photo, brief hardware specifications, features
  supported (currently working in NuttX), how to flash, special toolchains required, etc.
  This will involve migrating most of the content existing currently in board README files
  to RST documents here.

Supported Boards
================

NuttX supports a large number of boards (see :doc:`here </introduction/supported_platforms>`).
At the moment, the documentation available is in the form of README files inside each subdirectory
of ``boards`` directory of main NuttX repository.
