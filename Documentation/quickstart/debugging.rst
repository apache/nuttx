Debugging
=========

Finding and fixing bugs is an important part of the hardware and software development process. Sometimes you also need
to use debugging techniques to understand how the system works. Two tools that are helpful are debug logging and
debugging using the GNU Debugger (gdb).

Debug Logging
=============

NuttX has a powerful system logging facility (syslog) with ``info``, ``warn``, and ``error`` levels. You can enable
debugging for your build for the subsystem or feature by using the ``menuconfig`` system.

The debug options are available under :menuselection:`Build Setup --> Debug Options`. You will most likely have to enable the
following options:

* :menuselection:`Enable Debug Features` — selecting this will turn on subsystem-level debugging options, they will become visible
  on the page below. You can then select the ones you want.
* :menuselection:`Enable Error Output` — this will only log errors.
* :menuselection:`Enable Warnings Output` — this will log warnings and errors.
* :menuselection:`Enable Informational Debug Output` — this will produce informational output, warnings, and errors.

You can then select from the subsystems that are available, Network, Scheduler, USB, etc. Note that you will need to
separately enable the subsystem elsewhere in the ``menuconfig`` system. To see the ``CONFIG`` define that is set,
use the arrow keys to highlight the subsystem (for instance, :menuselection:`Network Debug Features`) and type :kbd:`?`. This will show
you that the C macro that is set is called ``CONFIG_DEBUG_NET``. ``debug.h`` defines the ``netinfo()`` logging
function that will log output if this macro is set. You can search the source code for ``netinfo`` to see how it is
used.

Note that enabling all these will produce an incredible amount of logging output. Enable the level you want and
the area you're interested in, and leave the rest disabled, save the config, and then recompile. You can see the full
list of debug feature logging functions in the file
`debug.h <https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/blob/master/include/debug.h>`__.

Syslog timestamps can be enabled in the configuration in :menuselection:`Device Drivers --> System Logging --> Prepend
timestamp to syslog message` (``CONFIG_SYSLOG_TIMESTAMP``).

You may need to do a little bit of experimenting to find the combination of logging settings that work for the problem
you're trying to solve. See the file `debug.h <https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/blob/master/include/debug.h>`_
for available debug settings that are available.

There are also subsystems that enable USB trace debugging, and you can log to memory too, if you need the logging to be
faster than what the console can output.

Debugging with ``openocd`` and ``gdb``
======================================

To debug our Nucleo board using its embedded SWD debug adapter,
start ``openocd`` with the following command:

.. code-block:: console

  $ openocd -f interface/st-link-v2.cfg -f target/stm32f1x.cfg

This will start a ``gdb`` server. Then, start ``gdb`` with:

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd nuttx/
  $ gdb-multiarch nuttx/nuttx

Inside ``gdb`` console, connect to the ``gdb`` server with:

.. code-block::

  (gdb) target extended-remote :3333

You can now use standard ``gdb`` commands. For example, to
reset the board:

.. code-block::

  (gdb) mon reset

To halt the board:

.. code-block::

  (gdb) mon halt
  
To set a breakpoint:

.. code-block::

  (gdb) breakpoint nsh_main

and to finally start nuttx:

.. code-block::

  (gdb) continue
  Continuing.

  Breakpoint 1, nsh_main (argc=1, argv=0x200ddfac) at nsh_main.c:208
  208	  sched_getparam(0, &param);
  (gdb) continue
  Continuing.
  
.. tip::

  You can abbreviate ``gdb`` commands: ``info b`` is a shortcut for
  ``information breakpoints``; ``c`` works the same as ``continue``, etc.

NuttX aware debugging
---------------------

Since NuttX is actually an RTOS, it is useful to have ``gdb`` be aware of the different
tasks/threads that are running. There are two ways to do this: via ``openocd``
itself or via ``gdb``. Note that in both cases, you need to enable debug symbols
(``CONFIG_DEBUG_SYMBOLS``).

With openocd
~~~~~~~~~~~~

``openocd`` supports various RTOS directly, including NuttX. It works by reading
into internal NuttX symbols which define the active tasks and their properties.
As a result, the ``gdb`` server will directly be aware of each task as a different
`thread`. The downside of this approach is that it depends on how you build NuttX
as there are some options hardcoded into
opencd. By default, it assumes:

  * ``CONFIG_DISABLE_MQUEUE=y``
  * ``CONFIG_PAGING=n``
  
If you need these options to be set differently, you will have to edit ``./src/rtos/nuttx_header.h`` from ``openocd``, 
change the corresponding settings and then rebuild it.

Finally, to enable NuttX integration, you need to supply an additional ``openocd`` argument:

.. code-block:: console

  $ openocd -f interface/st-link-v2.cfg -f target/stm32f1x.cfg -c '$_TARGETNAME configure -rtos nuttx'
  
Since ``openocd`` also needs to know the memory layout of certain datastructures, you need to have ``gdb``
run the following commands once the ``nuttx`` binary is loaded:

.. code-block::

  eval "monitor nuttx.pid_offset %d", &((struct tcb_s *)(0))->pid
  eval "monitor nuttx.xcpreg_offset %d", &((struct tcb_s *)(0))->xcp.regs
  eval "monitor nuttx.state_offset %d", &((struct tcb_s *)(0))->task_state
  eval "monitor nuttx.name_offset %d", &((struct tcb_s *)(0))->name
  eval "monitor nuttx.name_size %d", sizeof(((struct tcb_s *)(0))->name)
  
One way to do this is to define a gdb `hook` function that will be called when running ``file`` command:

.. code-block::

  define hookpost-file
    eval "monitor nuttx.pid_offset %d", &((struct tcb_s *)(0))->pid
    eval "monitor nuttx.xcpreg_offset %d", &((struct tcb_s *)(0))->xcp.regs
    eval "monitor nuttx.state_offset %d", &((struct tcb_s *)(0))->task_state
    eval "monitor nuttx.name_offset %d", &((struct tcb_s *)(0))->name
    eval "monitor nuttx.name_size %d", sizeof(((struct tcb_s *)(0))->name)
  end
  
You will see that ``openocd`` has received the memory offsets in its output:

.. code-block::

.. note:: You will probably see the ``Error: No symbols for NuttX`` error appear once at startup. This is OK
  unless you see it every time you step the debugger. In this case, it would mean you did not enable debug symbols.

Now, You can now inspect threads:

  faultmask      0x0                 0
  control        0x0                 0

With gdb
~~~~~~~~

You can also do NuttX aware debugging using ``gdb`` scripting support.
The benefit is that it works also for the sim build where ``openocd`` is
not applicable. For this to work, you will need to enable PROC filesystem support
which will expose required task information (``CONFIG_FS_PROCFS=y``). 

To use this approach, you can load the ``nuttx/tools/nuttx-gdbinit`` file. An
easy way to do this is to create a symbolic link:

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd $HOME
  $ ln -s nuttx/tools/nuttx-gdbinit .gdbinit
  
This way whenever gdb is started it will run the appropriate commands. To inspect
the threads you can now use the following ``gdb`` command:

.. code-block::

  (gdb) info_nxthreads
  target examined 
  _target_arch.name=armv7e-m
  $_target_has_fpu : 0 
  $_target_has_smp : 0 
  saved current_tcb (pid=0) 
  * 0 Thread 0x20000308  (Name: Idle Task, State: Running, Priority: 0) 0xdc in __start()
    1 Thread 0x20001480  (Name: init, State: Waiting,Semaphore, Priority: 100) 0x7e08 in arm_switchcontext()
