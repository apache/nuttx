.. note::
  This should be a brief introduction to how NuttX works and how to get it running. A widely used board could be targeted to create a brief demonstration on how to clone, configure, build, flash and run NuttX.
  For now, I've included the parts of the old porting guide which seemed more relevant for this section, but should be revised and made
  (new) user friendly.
