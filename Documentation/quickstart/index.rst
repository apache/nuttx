  This should be a brief introduction to how NuttX works and how to get it running. A widely used board could be targeted to create a brief demonstration on how to clone, configure, build, flash and run NuttX.
  For now, the content that is here presented is what remains of the old Porting Guide which is not already in another section of this documentation.

==========
Quickstart
==========

The present Quickstart guide is a work in progress and only contains some basic information. In the meantime you can look at NuttX main `README <https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx/blob/master/README.md>`_ file which contains some information that will help you get started.
