Getting Started
===============

This section describes how to get started with NuttX. :ref:`quickstart/quickstart:Quickstart` is for
experienced embedded developers, and quickly outlines the basic of getting NuttX configured and
compiled. Use this if you are experienced with FreeRTOS, Zephyr, or a similar RTOS.

The remaining sections are detailed instructions aimed at beginners for getting the necessary
compilers and other tools installed, then compiling NuttX and running on your hardware. There are sections
on configuring NuttX with more features than just the minimum, and a section on debugging. For reference
there is also a description of the code organization and some details about what happens when running ``make``
to build NuttX.
