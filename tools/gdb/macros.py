# NOTE: GDB stores macro information based on the current stack frame's scope,
# including the source file and line number. Therefore, there may be missing
# macro definitions when you are at different stack frames.
#
# To resolve this issue, we need to retrieve all macro information from the ELF file
# then parse and evaluate it by ourselves.
#
# There might be two ways to achieve this, one is to leverage the C preprocessor
# to directly preprocess all the macros instereted into python constants
# gcc -E -x c -P <file_with_macros> -I/path/to/nuttx/include
#
# While the other way is to leverage the dwarf info stored in the ELF file,
# with -g3 switch, we have a `.debug_macro` section containing all the information
# about the macros.
#
# Currently, we using the second method.
