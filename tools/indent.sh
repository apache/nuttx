#
# This script uses the Linux 'indent' utility to re-format C source files
# to match the coding style that I use.  It differs from the NuttX coding
# style in that:
#
# 1. I normally put the trailing */ of a multi-line comment on a separate
#    line.  If your C file already has properly formatted comments then
#    using -nfca instead of -fca eliminates that bad behavior
# 2. I usually align things vertically (like '=' in assignments),
# 3. indent.sh puts a bogus blank line at the top of the file,
# 4. I don't like the way it handles nested conditional compilation
#    intermixed with code.  I prefer the preprocessor conditiona tests
#    be all right justified in that case.
# 5. I also indent brackets differently on structures than does this script.
# 6. I normally use no spaces in casts.  indent.sh adds spaces in casts like
#   "(FAR void *)&foo" becomes "(FAR void *) & foo".
# 7. When used with header files, the initial idempotence conditional test
#    causes all preprecessor directives to be indented in the file.  So for
#    header files, you will need to substitute "^#  " with "#" in the
#    converted header file.
#
# You will manually need to check for the issues listed above after
# performing the conversion.
