:Usage
echo %progname% is a tool for flexible generation of include path arguments for a
echo variety of different compilers in a variety of compilation environments
echo USAGE: %progname% [-w] [-d] [-s] [-h] ^<compiler-path^> ^<dir1^> [^<dir2^> [^<dir3^> ...]]
echo Where:
echo  ^<compiler-path^>
echo    The full path to your compiler
echo  ^<dir1^> [^<dir2^> [^<dir3^> ...]]
echo    A list of include directories
echo  -w, -d
echo    For compatibility with incdir.sh (ignored)
echo  -s
echo    Generate standard, system header file paths instead of normal user
echo    header file paths.
echo  -h
echo    Shows this help text and exits.
