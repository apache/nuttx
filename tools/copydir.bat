rem NuttX uses symbolic links to configure platform-specific directories into
rem the build system.  This works great except for when a Windows native
rem toolchain is used in a Cygwin environment.  In that case, symbolic
rem links do not work correctly when accessed from the Windows native toolchain;
rem rather, just look link files with the extension .lnk
rem
rem In this environment, the build system will work around this using this script
rem as a replacement for the 'ln' command.  This scrpt will simply copy the
rem directory into the expected positiion.
