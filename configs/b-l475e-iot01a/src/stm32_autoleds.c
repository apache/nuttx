/* LEDs
 *
 * A single LED is available driven by PA13.
 *
 * These LEDs are not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
 * defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
 * include/board.h and src/sam_autoleds.c. The LEDs are used to encode
 * OS-related events as follows:
 *
 *   ------------------- ----------------------- ------
 *   SYMBOL              Meaning                 LED
 *   ------------------- ----------------------- ------
 *   LED_STARTED         NuttX has been started  OFF
 *   LED_HEAPALLOCATE    Heap has been allocated OFF
 *   LED_IRQSENABLED     Interrupts enabled      OFF
 *   LED_STACKCREATED    Idle stack created      ON
 *   LED_INIRQ           In an interrupt         N/C
 *   LED_SIGNAL          In a signal handler     N/C
 *   LED_ASSERTION       An assertion failed     N/C
 *   LED_PANIC           The system has crashed  FLASH
 *
 * Thus is LED is statically on, NuttX has successfully  booted and is,
 * apparently, running normally.  If LED is flashing at approximately
 * 2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system has halted.
