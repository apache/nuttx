 * Name: up_fillpage()
 *
 * Description:
 *  After a page is allocated and mapped by up_allocpage(), the actual
 *  filling of the page with data from the non-volatile, must be performed
 *  by a separate call to the architecture-specific function, up_fillpage().
 *  This function is non-blocking, it will start an asynchronous page fill.
 *  The common paging logic will provide a callback function, pg_callback,
 *  that will be called when the page fill is finished (or an error occurs).
 *  This callback is assumed to occur from an interrupt level when the
 *  device driver completes the fill operation.
 *
 *  NOTE 1: Allocating and filling a page is a two step process.  up_allocpage()
 *  allocates the page, and up_fillpage() fills it with data from some non-
 *  volatile storage device.  This distinction is made because up_allocpage()
 *  can probably be implemented in board-independent logic whereas up_fillpage()
 *  probably must be implemented as board-specific logic.
 *
 *  NOTE 2: The initial mapping of vpage will be read-able, write-able,
 *  but non-cacheable.  No special actions will be required of
 *  up_fillpage() in order to write into this allocated page.  If the
 *  virtual address maps to a text region, however, this function should
 *  remap the region so that is is read/execute only.  It should be made
 *  cache-able in any case.

 * Input Parameters:
 *   tcb - A reference to the task control block of the task that needs to
 *         have a page fill.  Architecture-specific logic can retrieve page
 *         fault information from the architecture-specific context
 *         information in this TCB to perform the fill.
 *   pg_callbck - The function to be called when the page fill is complete.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This function will return zero (OK) if the page fill was successfully
 *   started (the result of the page fill is passed to the callback function
 *   as the result argument).  A negated errno value may be returned if an
 *   error occurs.  All errors, however, are fatal.
 *
 *   NOTE: -EBUSY has a special meaning. It is used internally to mean that
 *   the callback function has not executed.  Therefore, -EBUSY should
 *   never be provided in the result argument of pg_callback.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   - This function is called from the normal tasking context (but
 *     interrupts siabled).  The implementation must take whatever actions
 *     are necessary to assure that the operation is safe within this context.
 *   - Upon return, the caller will sleep waiting for the page fill callback
 *     to occur.  The callback function will perform the wakeup.
