 * Description:
 *   board_button_initialize() must be called to initialize button resources.
 *
 *   After board_button_initialize() has been called, board_buttons() may be
 *   called to collect the state of all buttons.  board_buttons() returns an
 *   32-bit bit set with each bit associated with a button.
 *   See the BUTTON_*_BIT definitions in board.h for the meaning of each bit.
 *
 *   board_button_irq() may be called to register an interrupt handler that
 *   will be called when a button is depressed or released.  The ID value is
 *   a button enumeration value that uniquely identifies a button resource.
 *   See the BUTTON_* definitions in board.h for the meaning of enumeration
 *   value.
