	* Initial Release
	* Support for Linux user mode simulation and TI
	  TMS320C5471 (Arm7) provided

0.1.1 2007-xx-xx  Gregory Nutt <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>

	* Corrected an error in interrupt level context switching
	  for C5471
	* Added fgets() and gets() logic; verified c5471 console read.
	* Corrected error in reading from serial port.  Improper
	  use of semaphore can cause deadlock.
	* Tasks can now accept a configurable maximum number of
	  input parameters (argc)
	* Attempts to use C5471 console from interrupt handlers
	  can casue errors. Added a special path for this case.
	* Refuse calls to sem_wait and sem_trywait from interrupt
	  handlers.  This was happening because interrupt handlers
	  were calling printf-like functions.
	* Added strtok() and strtok_r()
	* Added a simple shell called nsh (see examples/nsh).
	* Documentation updates
