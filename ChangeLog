0.1.0 2007-03-09  Gregory Nutt <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>

	* Initial Release
	* Support for Linux user mode simulation and TI
	  TMS320C5471 (Arm7) provided

0.1.1 2007-03-14  Gregory Nutt <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>

	* Corrected an error in interrupt level context switching
	  for C5471
	* Added fgets() and gets() logic; verified c5471 console read.
	* Corrected error in reading from the C5471 serial port:
          Improper use of semaphore can cause deadlock.
	* Fixed an error in the memory cleanup:  The idle task
	  cannot take sempahores (because it must always be ready
	  to run).
	* Tasks can now accept a configurable maximum number of
	  input parameters (argc)
	* _task_init() was divided into separate functions that
	  require fewer parameters.  This was necessary to keep
	  the stack usage down for the 8051/2 (which has only
	  256 bytes of stack).
	* Attempts to use C5471 console from interrupt handlers
	  can cause errors. Added a special path for this case.
	* Refuse calls to sem_wait and sem_trywait from interrupt
	  handlers.  This was happening because interrupt handlers
	  were calling printf-like functions.
	* Added strtok() and strtok_r()
	* Added a simple shell called nsh (see examples/nsh).
	* Platform support for 8052 is complete but not stable
	  when the timer interrupt is enabled.  Seems to be an
	  issue when SP enters indirect address space.
	* Documentation updates

0.1.2 2007-03-19  Gregory Nutt <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>

	* Add dirent.h, opendir(), readdir(), closedir(), etc.
	* Add strerror()
	* Added 'ls' command to nsh
	* Added C5471 watchdog driver
	* Fixed another bug where free() is called from IDLE task.
	  Can't do this; the caller must be able to wait for access
	  to memory.
	* Fixed bugs associated with debug output:
          Cannot do dbg() in middle of context switch logic.
	  because it may require use of semaphores and cause
	  additional context switches. lldbg() is safe.
	* Interrupt must be disabled throughout all context switches.
	* Separated C5471 serial driver; a shareable part is
	  in drivers/. ; the C5471 specific part is in arch/C5471.
	  serial.h defines the interface.
	* Fixed mq_receive() and mq_send() -- bad memcpy()
	* Fixed C5471 signal deliver logic: use of dbg() and
          other actions by use signal handler can alter errno.
          need to protect errno during signal handling.
	* Fixed uninitialized variable in filesystem that could
	  cause various problems
	* Added a test for roundrobin scheduler.

0.2.1 2007-03-22  Gregory Nutt <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>

	* Fix error in handing signed decimal in vsprintf().
	* Major restructuring of header files to get closer to
	  POSIX compliance.
	* Eliminate compilation warnings that that crept into
	  recent check-ins
	* Add kill()
	* Added support for POSIX timers
	* Some Documentation updates
	* Added support for the Neuros OSD / DM320

0.2.2 2007-03-26 Gregory Nutt <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>
	* Created the configs/ directory; separated board configuration
	  from processor architecture logic
	* Add memory leak detection test to examples/ostest
	* Corrected memory leak in OS pthread join logic
	* Corrected memory leaks in examples/ostest due to failures
	  to join or detach from pthreads.
	* Added pthread_once(), pthread_kill(), pthread_sigmask()
	* Added pthread_barrierattr_*() APIs
	* Added pthread_barrier_init(), pthread_barrier_destroy(), and
	  pthread_barrier_wait();
	* Added pthread barrier test
	* Added protection so that errno cannot be modified from
	  interrupt handling.
	* sched_setparam(), sched_setscheduler() now correctly set
	  errno; pthread_setscheduler() now returns the correct errno.
	* Added pthread_setschedprio().
	* Added directories to hold board-specific header files
	* Added directories to hold board-specific drivers

0.2.3 2007-03-29 Gregory Nutt <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>

	* mq_receive and mq_send now return errno's appropriately
	* mq_receive and mq_send are now correctly awakened by signals.
	* Fixed an unmatched sched_lock/unlock pair in task_delete().
	* sched_lock must be called in _exit() because operation of
	  task_delete() can cause pending tasks to be merged and a
	  context switch to occur.
	* Added mq_timedreceive() and mq_timedsend()
	* signal mask is now inherited by both child tasks and threads.
	* Improved sharebility of stdout among pthreads (only).  Nothing
	  was broken, but by moving the mutual exclusion logic to a
	  higher level, the printf output is more readable.
	* Fixed a bug in file system cleanup:  A list was being deleted
	  before the buffers contained in the list.
	* Fixed a bug in the wait-for-message-queue-not-empty logic.
	* Added a test of timed mqueue operations; detected and corrected
	  some mqueue errors.
	* Identified and corrected a race condition associated with
	  pthread_join.  In the failure condition, memory was being
	  deallocated while still in use.

0.2.4 2007-04-28 Gregory Nutt <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>

	* Verfied c5471 build under Cygwin on WinXP
	* Makesystem changes to better support different SoCs.
	* Made arch/c5471/include and arch/dm320/include identical in
	  preparation for merging into arch/arm
	* Logic from arch/c5471 and arch/dm320 combined into arch/arm.
	  arch/c5471 and arch/dm320 are deprecated and will be removed
	  when the new c5471 and dm320 logic is verified.

0.2.5 2007-05-19 Gregory Nutt <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>

	* Corrected some build/configuration issues introduced with the
	  last release.

	  development board (untested)
	* Added support for block devices.

	* Added mount() and umount()
	* Fix bug in memcmp return value

	* Added missing irqrestore() in timer_deletall().
	* close() was not closing the underlying device.
	* Added fsync()
	* Added strspn() and strcspn()

0.2.6 2007-05-26 Gregory Nutt <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>

	* Added unlink(), mkdir(), rmdir(), and rename()
	* Fixed several serious FAT errors with oflags handling (&& instead of &)
	* Added FAT support for unlink(), mkdir(), rmdir(), and rename
	* Added FAT support for opendir(), closedir(), readdir(), seekdir(),
	  telldir(), rewindir().
	* Fixed ARM compilation errors introduced in 0.2.5 (that is what I get
	  for only testing on the simulation).

	* sched/usleep.c: Fixed nsec calculation
	* lib/lib_strcspn.c: Function incorrectly named strspn().

	* examples/ostest/sighand.c: Don't call fflush() if streams are disabled
	* include/limits.h, include/time.h, sched/clock_internal.h: A support for
	  using selectable system timer frequency.
	* Fixed error in mountpoint related conditional compilation introduced
	  in 0.2.5
	* Restructured some Makefiles to better handle enabling and disabling
	  NuttX features without having so much conditional compilation in the
	  source files.
	* tools/mkconfig.c: No longer depends on asprintf() and _GNU_SOURCE and
	  so should now build in non-GNU, non-GLIBC environments.
	* include/nuttx/compiler.h: Fix for using SDCC with the Z80.
	* include/assert.h & arch/pjrc-8051/src/up_assert.c: SDCC does support
	  __FILE__and __LINE__ (not tested)
	* examples/ostest/barrier.c: Don't call usleep() when signals are
	  disabled.

0.2.8 2007-07-02 Gregory Nutt <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>
	* tools/Makefile.mkconfig: Under Cygwin, executable has a different name
	* tools/mkdeps.sh & arch/arm/src/Makefile: Corrected a problem makeing dependencies

	  unsetenv
	* Correct an error in realloc() when the block is extended "down" in memory.
	  In this case, the old memory contents need to be copied to the new location

	* examples/nsh/: Break into several files.
	* lib/: Added strrchr, basename, dirname

	* Separated net/uip/uip.c into several functions in several files.

	* Modified DHCPC (netutils/dhcpc) so that it should work in environments where
	  there are more than one DHCPD server.
	* NSH ifconfig command now shows uIP status was well (examples/nsh)
