config LIBC_EXECFUNCS
	bool "Enable exec[l|v] / posix_spawn() Support"
	default n
	depends on !BINFMT_DISABLE
	---help---
		Enable support for the exec[l|v] family of functions that can be
		used to start other programs, terminating the current program and
		the posix_spawn() familty of functions that can be used start other
		programs without terminating the current program.  The typical
		usage of the exec[l|v] functions is (1) first call vfork() to create
		a new thread, then (2) call exec[l|v] to replace the new thread with
		a program from the file system.

		NOTE 1: This two step process start is completely unnecessary in
		NuttX and is provided only for compatibily with Unix systems.  These
		functions are essentially just wrapper functions that (1) call the
		non-standard binfmt function 'exec', and then (2) exit(0).  Since
		the new thread will be terminated by the exec[l|v] call, it really
		served no purpose other than to suport Unix compatility.

		The posix_spawn() functions do not have this inefficiency.

		NOTE 2: Support for exec[l|v] and posix_spawn() is conditional
		because they require additional support for symbol tables that
		will not be available in the typical system.

config EXECFUNCS_HAVE_SYMTAB
	bool "Have symbol table"
	default n if BUILD_KERNEL
	default y if !BUILD_KERNEL
	---help---
		If you have a system symbol table, then you must select this
		option in order to use it.  Symbol tables are required in most
		cases in order to like executable programs to the base code.

if EXECFUNCS_HAVE_SYMTAB
config EXECFUNCS_SYMTAB
	string "Symbol table used by exec[l|v]"
	default "g_symtab"
	---help---
		The exec[l|v] and posix_spawn() functions are wrapper functions that
		call the non-standard binfmt function 'exec').  The binfmt
		function 'exec' needs to have (1) a symbol table that provides the
		list of symbols exported by the base code, and (2) the number of
		symbols in that table.  This selection provides the name of that
		symbol table.

config EXECFUNCS_NSYMBOLS
	int "Number of Symbols in the Table"
	default 0
	---help---
		The exec[l|v] and posix_spawn() functions are wrapper functions that

config POSIX_SPAWN_PROXY_STACKSIZE
	int "Spawn Stack Size"
	default 1024
	---help---
		If posix_spawn[p]() and task_spawn() use I/O redirection options,
		they will require an intermediary/proxy task to muck with the file
		descriptors.  This configuration item specifies the stack size
		used for the proxy. Default: 1024 bytes.

config TASK_SPAWN_DEFAULT_STACKSIZE
	int "Default task_spawn Stack Size"
	default 2048
	depends on !ARCH_ADDRENV
	---help---
		The actual size to use for the child task's stack can be set with
		task_spawnattr_setstacksize().  This value specifies the default
		stack size to use if task_spawnattr_setstacksize() is not used.
		Default: 2048.
