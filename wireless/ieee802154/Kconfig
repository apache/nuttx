menuconfig WIRELESS_IEEE802154
	bool "IEEE 802.15.4 Support"
	default n
	select MM_IOB
	depends on WIRELESS
	---help---
		Enables a Media Access Controller for any IEEE802.15.4 radio
		device. This in turn can be used by higher layer entities
		such as 6lowpan.

config IEEE802154_DEFAULT_EADDR
	hex "IEEE 802.15.4 Default Extended Address"
	default 0x00fade00deadbeef

		Set the default extended address to be used by MAC networks on init

	depends on SCHED_WORKQUEUE
	---help---
		Work queue support is required to use the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer.
		If the low priority work queue is available, then it should be used by
		the driver.

config IEEE802154_NTXDESC
	int "Number or TX descriptors"
	default 3
	---help---
		Configured number of Tx descriptors. Default: 3
		
config IEEE802154_IND_PREALLOC
	int "Number of pre-allocated meta-data structures"
	default 20
	---help---
		This specifies the total number of preallocated meta data structures
		must be allocated with each incoming packet.  These may be allocated
		from either from tasking logic or from interrupt level logic.

config IEEE802154_IND_IRQRESERVE
	int "Rserved pre-allocated meta-data structures"
	default 10
	---help---
		If meta-data structures can be allocated from interrupt handlers,
		then this specifies the number of pre-allocatd meta-data structures
		that are reserved for for use only by interrupt handlers.  This may
		be zero to reserve no meta-data structures for interrupt handlers.
		In that case, the allocation will fail if tasking logic has
		allocated them all.

		Interrupt logic will first attempt to allocate from the general,
		pre-allocated structure pool that will contain up to (size
		CONFIG_IEEE802154_IND_PREALLOC - CONFIG_IEEE802154_IND_IRQRESERVE)
		entries.  If that fails, then it will try to take a structure from
		the reserve (size CONFIG_IEEE802154_IND_IRQRESERVE).

		Non-interrupt logic will also first attempt to allocate from the
		general, pre-allocated structure pool.  If that fails, it will
		dynamically allocate the meta data structure with an additional cost in performance.
		
config IEEE802154_MACDEV
	bool "Character driver for IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer"
	default n
	depends on WIRELESS_IEEE802154
	---help---
		Enable the device driver to expose the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer
		access to user space as IOCTLs

if IEEE802154_MACDEV

config IEEE802154_MACDEV_RECVRPRIO
	int "Priority of frame receiver registerd with the MAC layer"
	default 0
	---help---
		When the MAC layer receives an incoming data frame, it passes the frame
		to registered receivers, in order of receiver priority, until one of the
		receivers claim the frame.

		An example case would be when 6LoWPAN and the MAC character driver are
		enabled. Both have receivers registered with the MAC. The 6LoWPAN layer
		should get assigned a higher priority than the character driver. In this
		case, the 6LoWPAN receiver will receive the frame first. If the frame is
		a 6LoWPAN frame, it will claim the frame and the MAC will not pass the
		frame to any additional receivers. If it does not claim the frame, the
		MAC layer will call the next highest priority receiver, in this case,
		the MAC character driver (which should always be lowest priority since
		it is a "catch-all" type receiver).
