menuconfig WIRELESS_IEEE802154
	bool "IEEE 802.15.4 Support"
	default n
	select MM_IOB
	depends on WIRELESS
	---help---
		Enables a Media Access Controller for any IEEE802.15.4 radio
		device. This in turn can be used by higher layer entities
		such as 6lowpan.

if WIRELESS_IEEE802154

config IEEE802154_PRIMITIVE_PREALLOC
	int "Number of pre-allocated primitive structures"
	default 20
	---help---
		This specifies the total number of preallocated primitive structures.
		A primitive is an abstracted data type that provides service information
		between the MAC layer and the next highest layer. These may be allocated
		from either from tasking logic or from interrupt level logic.

config IEEE802154_PRIMITIVE_IRQRESERVE
	int "Reserved pre-allocated primitive structures"
	default 0
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
		If primitives can be allocated from interrupt handlers, then this
		specifies the number of pre-allocated meta-data structures that are
		reserved for for use only by interrupt handlers.  This may be zero to
		reserve no meta-data structures for interrupt handlers. In that case,
		the allocation will fail if tasking logic has allocated them all.

		Interrupt logic will first attempt to allocate from the general,
		pre-allocated structure pool that will contain up to (size
		CONFIG_IEEE802154_PRIMITIVE_PREALLOC - CONFIG_IEEE802154_PRIMITIVE_IRQRESERVE)
		entries.  If that fails, then it will try to take a structure from
		the reserve (size CONFIG_IEEE802154_PRIMITIVE_IRQRESERVE).

		Non-interrupt logic will also first attempt to allocate from the
		general, pre-allocated structure pool.  If that fails, it will
		dynamically allocate the primitive with an additional cost in performance.

		NOTE: Currently marked as experimental and with a default of zero
		because there are no interrupt level allocations performed by the
		current IEEE 802.15.4 MAC code.

config IEEE802154_MAC
	bool "Software MAC layer"
	default n
	---help---
		There are two types of IEEE 802.15.4 radios supported. Those that provide
		all MAC functionality equivalent to the MAC802154 software implementation,
		and radios that provide a lower half to the MAC802154 software layer.
		This option enables the software MAC layer that can interface with
		the lower-half radio drivers.

if IEEE802154_MAC

config MAC802154_NTXDESC
	int "Number or TX descriptors"
	default 5
	---help---
		Configured number of Tx descriptors. Default: 3

		When used with 6LoWPAN, the descriptor allocator runs on a work
		and must avoid blocking if possible.  Each frame will be provided in
		an IOB and each TX frame will need a TX descriptor.  So the safe
		thing to do is set CONFIG_MAC802154_NTXDESC to CONFIG_IOB_NBUFFERS.
		Then there should be the maximum pre-allocated buffers for each
		possible TX frame.

config MAC802154_NPANDESC
	int "Number of PAN descriptors"
	default 5
	---help---
		Configured number of PAN descriptors Default: 5

		When performing a scan to find a suitable PAN, the MAC must store
		information for all unique beacons received. This is the number of unique
		descriptors that can be held before the scan cancels with LIMIT_REACHED.

config MAC802154_SFEVENT_VERBOSE
	bool "Verbose logging related to superframe events"
	default n
	depends on DEBUG_WIRELESS_INFO
	---help---
		Enable verbose logging of superframe events Default: false

config MAC802154_LOCK_VERBOSE
	bool "Verbose logging related to MAC lock management"
	default n
	depends on DEBUG_WIRELESS_INFO
	---help---
		Enable verbose logging of MAC lock management. Default: false


config IEEE802154_MACDEV
	bool "Character driver for IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer"
	default n
	depends on WIRELESS_IEEE802154
	---help---
		Enable the device driver to expose the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer
		access to user space as IOCTLs

if IEEE802154_MACDEV

config IEEE802154_MACDEV_RECVRPRIO
	int "Priority of frame receiver registered with the MAC layer"
	default 0
	---help---
		When the MAC layer receives an incoming data frame, it passes the frame
		to registered receivers, in order of receiver priority, until one of the
		receivers claim the frame.

		An example case would be when 6LoWPAN and the MAC character driver are
		enabled. Both have receivers registered with the MAC. The 6LoWPAN layer
		should get assigned a higher priority than the character driver. In this
		case, the 6LoWPAN receiver will receive the frame first. If the frame is
		a 6LoWPAN frame, it will claim the frame and the MAC will not pass the
		frame to any additional receivers. If it does not claim the frame, the
		MAC layer will call the next highest priority receiver, in this case,
		the MAC character driver (which should always be lowest priority since
		it is a "catch-all" type receiver).

	---help---
		Add support for the IEEE802.15.4 6LoWPAN network device built on
		the common IEEE802.15.4 MAC.
