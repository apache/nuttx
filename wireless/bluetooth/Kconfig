menuconfig WIRELESS_BLUETOOTH
	bool "Bluetooth LE support"
	default n
	depends on ALLOW_BSD_COMPONENTS
	select MM_IOB
	select SCHED_HPWORK
	select SCHED_LPWORK
	---help---
		This option enables Bluetooth Low Energy support.

if WIRELESS_BLUETOOTH

menuconfig WIRELESS_BLUETOOTH_HOST
	bool "BLE Host Layer"
	default y
	---help---
		This enables support for BLE host layer implementation. This can be
		used to interface to a BLE controller via HCI protocol (either to a local
		BLE link-layer or to an external device over HCI UART).

if WIRELESS_BLUETOOTH_HOST
config DEVICE_APPEARANCE
	int "Appearance sub-category value"
	default 0
	range 0 5188
	---help---
		This value comes from the "Appearance sub-category"
		section (2.6.3) in the Bluetooth Assigned Numbers document.

config DEVICE_NAME
	string "Device name"
	default "Apache NuttX"
	---help---
		The device name.

config DEVICE_LOCAL_NAME
	string "Device local name"
	default "NuttX"
	---help---
		The device name used for advertising.

endif # WIRELESS_BLUETOOTH_HOST

config BLUETOOTH_MAX_CONN
	int "Maximum number of simultaneous connections"
	default 1
	range 1 16
	---help---
		Maximum number of simultaneous Bluetooth connections
		supported. The minimum (and default) number is 1.

config BLUETOOTH_MAX_PAIRED
	int "Maximum number of paired devices"
	default 1
	range 1 32
	---help---
		Maximum number of paired Bluetooth devices. The minimum (and
		default) number is 1.

config BLUETOOTH_MAXSCANDATA
	int "Max scan data size"
	default 64
	range 1 255
	---help---
		Scan results will be buffered in memory until the user requests the
		scan results.  This parameter specifies the maximum size of the
		advertiser data that accompanies the scan result.

		This contributes to a static memory allocation that will be greater
		than CONFIG_BLUETOOTH_MAXSCANDATA * CONFIG_BLUETOOTH_MAXSCANRESULT

config BLUETOOTH_MAXSCANRESULT
	int "Max scan results"
	default 8
	range 1 255
	---help---
		Scan results will be buffered in memory until the user requests the
		scan results.  This parameter specifies the maximum number of
		results that can be buffered before scan results are lost.

		This contributes to a static memory allocation that will be greater
		than CONFIG_BLUETOOTH_MAXSCANDATA * CONFIG_BLUETOOTH_MAXSCANRESULT

config BLUETOOTH_MAXDISCOVER
	int "Max GATT discovery results"
	default 8
	range 1 255
	---help---
		GATT discovery results will be buffered in memory until the user
		requests the results.  This parameter specifies the maximum results
		that can be buffered before discovery results are lost.

config BLUETOOTH_BUFFER_PREALLOC
	int "Number of pre-allocated buffer structures"
	default 20
	---help---
		This specifies the total number of preallocated buffer structures.
		This is for performance optimization.  If additional buffer structures
		are needed, they will be allocated dynamically at some loss of
		performance.

config BLUETOOTH_BUFFER_IRQRESERVE
	int "Reserved pre-allocated primitive structures"
	default 0
	---help---
		If buffer structures can be allocated from interrupt handlers, then
		this specifies the number of pre-allocated structures that are
		reserved for for use only by interrupt handlers.  This may be set
		zero to reserve no buffers for interrupt handlers. In that case,
		the allocation will fail if tasking logic has allocated them all.

		Interrupt logic will first attempt to allocate from the general,
		pre-allocated buffer pool that will contain up to (size
		CONFIG_BLUETOOTH_BUFFER_PREALLOC - BLUETOOTH_BUFFER_IRQRESERVE)
		entries.  If that fails, then it will try to take a buffer from
		the reserve (size CONFIG_BLUETOOTH_BUFFER_IRQRESERVE).

		Non-interrupt logic will also first attempt to allocate from the
		general, pre-allocated buffer pool.  If that fails, it will
		dynamically allocate the buffer with an additional cost in
		performance.

		NOTE:  The Bluetooth stack never allocates buffers from the
		interrupt level.  This setting only needs to be non-zero if your
		low-level Bluetooth driver needs to do such allocations.

	default 100
	range 1 255

config BLUETOOTH_TXCMD_NMSGS

	default 16

	int "Tx connection thread priority"

	range 1 255

config BLUETOOTH_TXCONN_NMSGS
	int "Tx connection thread mqueue size"
	default 16

endmenu # Kernel Thread Configuration

config BLUETOOTH_SMP_SELFTEST
	bool "Bluetooth SMP self tests executed on init"
	default n
	---help---
		This option enables SMP self-tests executed on startup
		to verify security and crypto functions.
