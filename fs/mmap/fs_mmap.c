 * Name: mmap
 *
 * Description:
 *   NuttX operates in a flat open address space.  Therefore, it generally
 *   does not require mmap() functionality.  There are two exceptions:
 *
 *   1. mmap() is the API that is used to support direct access to random
 *     access media under the following very restrictive conditions:
 *
 *     a. The filesystem supports the FIOC_MMAP ioctl command.  Any file
 *        system that maps files contiguously on the media should support
 *        this ioctl. (vs. file system that scatter files over the media
 *        in non-contiguous sectors).  As of this writing, ROMFS is the
 *        only file system that meets this requirement.
 *     b. The underlying block driver supports the BIOC_XIPBASE ioctl
 *        command that maps the underlying media to a randomly accessible
 *        address. At  present, only the RAM/ROM disk driver does this.
 *
 *   2. If CONFIG_FS_RAMMAP is defined in the configuration, then mmap() will
 *      support simulation of memory mapped files by copying files whole
 *      into RAM.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   start   A hint at where to map the memory -- ignored.  The address
 *           of the underlying media is fixed and cannot be re-mapped without
 *           MMU support.
 *   length  The length of the mapping.  For exception #1 above, this length
 *           ignored:  The entire underlying media is always accessible.
 *   prot    See the PROT_* definitions in sys/mman.h.
 *           PROT_NONE      - Will cause an error
 *           PROT_READ      - PROT_WRITE and PROT_EXEC also assumed
 *           PROT_WRITE     - PROT_READ and PROT_EXEC also assumed
 *           PROT_EXEC      - PROT_READ and PROT_WRITE also assumed
 *   flags   See the MAP_* definitions in sys/mman.h.
 *           MAP_SHARED     - MAP_PRIVATE or MAP_SHARED required
 *           MAP_PRIVATE    - MAP_PRIVATE or MAP_SHARED required
 *           MAP_FIXED      - Will cause an error
 *           MAP_FILE       - Ignored
 *           MAP_ANONYMOUS  - Optional
 *           MAP_ANON       - Will cause an error
 *           MAP_GROWSDOWN  - Ignored
 *           MAP_DENYWRITE  - Will cause an error
 *           MAP_EXECUTABLE - Ignored
 *           MAP_LOCKED     - Ignored
 *           MAP_NORESERVE  - Ignored
 *           MAP_POPULATE   - Ignored
 *           MAP_NONBLOCK   - Ignored
 *   fd      file descriptor of the backing file -- required.
 *   offset  The offset into the file to map
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, mmap() returns a pointer to the mapped area. On error, the
 *   value MAP_FAILED is returned, and errno is set appropriately.
 *
 *     ENOSYS
 *       Returned if any of the unsupported mmap() features are attempted
 *     EBADF
 *      'fd' is not a valid file descriptor.
 *     EINVAL
 *      Length is 0. flags contained neither MAP_PRIVATE or MAP_SHARED, or
 *      contained both of these values.
 *     ENODEV
 *      The underlying filesystem of the specified file does not support
 *      memory mapping.
