 * Name: foreach_mountpoint
 *
 * Description:
 *   Visit each mountpoint in the pseudo-file system.  The traversal is
 *   terminated when the callback 'handler' returns a non-zero value, or when
 *   all of the mountpoints have been visited.
 *
 *   This is just a front end "filter" to foreach_inode() that forwards only
 *   mountpoint inodes.  It is intended to support the mount() command to
 *   when the mount command is used to enumerate mounts.
 *
 *   NOTE 1: Use with caution... The pseudo-file system is locked throughout
 *   the traversal.
 *   NOTE 2: The search algorithm is recursive and could, in principle, use
 *   an indeterminant amount of stack space.  This will not usually be a
 *   real work issue.
