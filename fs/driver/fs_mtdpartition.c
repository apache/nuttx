 * Name: register_mtdpartition
 *
 * Description:
 *   Register a mtd partition driver inode the pseudo file system.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   partition  - The path to the partition inode
 *   parent     - The path to the parent inode
 *   firstblock - The offset in block to the partition
 *   nblocks    - The number of block in the partition
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero on success (with the inode point in 'inode'); A negated errno
 *   value is returned on a failure (all error values returned by
 *   inode_reserve):
 *
 *   EINVAL - 'path' is invalid for this operation
 *   EEXIST - An inode already exists at 'path'
 *   ENOMEM - Failed to allocate in-memory resources for the operation
 *
