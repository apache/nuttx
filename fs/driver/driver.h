/****************************************************************************
 * Name: find_blockdriver
 *
 * Description:
 *   Return the inode of the block driver specified by 'pathname'
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   pathname   - The full path to the block driver to be located
 *   mountflags - If MS_RDONLY is not set, then driver must support write
 *                operations (see include/sys/mount.h)
 *   ppinode    - Address of the location to return the inode reference
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Returns zero on success or a negated errno on failure:
 *
 *   ENOENT  - No block driver of this name is registered
 *   ENOTBLK - The inode associated with the pathname is not a block driver
 *   EACCESS - The MS_RDONLY option was not set but this driver does not
 *             support write access

 * Name: block_proxy

 * Description:

 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   blkdev - The path to the block driver
 *   oflags - Character driver open flags
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   If positive, non-zero file descriptor is returned on success.  This
 *   is the file descriptor of the nameless character driver that mediates

 *
 *   Errors that may be returned:
 *
 *     ENOMEM - Failed to create a temporary path name.

 * Name: mtd_proxy

 *   mtddev  - The path to the mtd driver
 *   mountflags - if MS_RDONLY is not set, then driver must support write

 *   ppinode - address of the location to return the inode reference
