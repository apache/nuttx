 * Name: nxffs_blockstats
 *
 * Description:
 *   Analyze the NXFFS volume.  This operation must be performed when the
 *   volume is first mounted in order to detect if the volume has been
 *   formatted and contains a usable NXFFS file system.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   volume - Describes the current NXFFS volume.
 *   stats  - On return, will hold nformation describing the state of the
 *     volume.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Negated errnos are returned only in the case of MTD reported failures.
 *   Nothing in the volume data itself will generate errors.
 *
