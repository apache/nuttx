config NFS_DONT_BIND_TCP_SOCKET
	bool
	default n
	depends on NET_TCP
	---help---
		Some network drivers such as GS2200M do not support to bind
		a local port for TCP client socket. In this case, this config
		disables to bind the port.

config NFS_STATISTICS
	bool "NFS Statistics"
	default n
	depends on NFS
	---help---
		Collect support for NFS statistics.  There is no user interface to
		obtain these statistics, however.  So they would only be of value
		if you add debug instrumentation or use a debugger.
