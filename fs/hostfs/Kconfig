config FS_HOSTFS
	bool "Host File System"
	default n
	depends on !DISABLE_MOUNTPOINT
	select FS_READABLE
	select FS_WRITABLE
	---help---
		The Host file system provides a mechanism to mount directories
		from the host OS during simulation mode.  The host directory
		to be "mounted" is specified during the mount command using
		the -o command line switch, such as:

			mount -t hostfs -o fs=/home/user/nuttx_root /host

		For non-NSH operation, the option "fs=home/user/nuttx_root" would
		be passed to the 'mount()' routine using the optional 'void *data'
		parameter.
