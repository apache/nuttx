/****************************************************************************
 * Name:  sem_close
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is called to indicate that the calling task is finished
 *   with the specified named semaphore, 'sem'.  The sem_close() deallocates
 *   any system resources allocated by the system for this named semaphore.
 *
 *   If the semaphore has not been removed with a call to sem_unlink(), then
 *   sem_close() has no effect on the named semaphore.  However, when the
 *   named semaphore has been fully unlinked, the semaphore will vanish when
 *   the last task closes it.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *  sem - semaphore descriptor
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *  0 (OK), or -1 (ERROR) if unsuccessful.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   - Care must be taken to avoid risking the deletion of a semaphore that
 *     another calling task has already locked.
 *   - sem_close must not be called for an un-named semaphore
 *
