 * Name: sem_unlink
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function removes the semaphore named by the input parameter 'name.'
 *   If the semaphore named by 'name' is currently referenced by other task,
 *   the sem_unlink() will have no effect on the state of the semaphore.  If
 *   one or more processes have the semaphore open when sem_unlink() is
 *   called, destruction of the semaphore will be postponed until all
 *   references to the semaphore have been destroyed by calls of sem_close().
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   name - Semaphore name
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *  0 (OK), or -1 (ERROR) if unsuccessful.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *
