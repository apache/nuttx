 * Name: mkdir
 *
 * Description:
 *   The readlink() function will place the contents of the symbolic link
 *   referred to by 'path' in the buffer 'buf' which has size 'bufsize'. If
 *   the number of bytes in the symbolic link is less than bufsize, the
 *   contents of the remainder of 'buf' are unspecified. If the buf argument
 *   is not large enough to contain the link content, the first bufsize bytes
 *   will be placed in buf.  If the value of bufsize is greater than
 *   {SSIZE_MAX}, the result is implementation-defined. *
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   path   - The full path to the symbolic link
 *   buf    - The user-provided buffer in which to return the path to the
 *            link target.
 *   bufixe - The size of 'buf'
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Upon successful completion, readlink() will return the count of bytes
 *   placed in the buffer. Otherwise, it will return a value of -1, leave the
 *   buffer unchanged, and set errno to indicate the error.
 *
