 *   whence   Defines how to use offset
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   The resulting offset on success.  A negated errno value is returned on

 *  - It is not a cancellation point.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: lseek
 *
 * Description:
 *   The lseek() function repositions the offset of the open file associated
 *   with the file descriptor fd to the argument 'offset' according to the
 *   directive 'whence' as follows:
 *
 *   SEEK_SET
 *      The offset is set to offset bytes.
 *   SEEK_CUR
 *      The offset is set to its current location plus offset bytes.
 *   SEEK_END
 *      The offset is set to the size of the file plus offset bytes.
 *
 *  The lseek() function allows the file offset to be set beyond the end of
 *  the file (but this does not change the size of the file). If data is
 *  later written at this point, subsequent reads of the data in the gap (a
 *  "hole") return null bytes ('\0') until data is actually written into the
 *  gap.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   fd       File descriptor of device
 *   offset   Defines the offset to position to
 *   whence   Defines how to use offset
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   The resulting offset on success. -1 on failure withi errno set properly:
 *
 *   EBADF      fd is not an open file descriptor.
 *   EINVAL     whence  is  not one of SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, SEEK_END; or the
 *              resulting file offset would be negative, or beyond the end of
 *              a seekable device.
 *   EOVERFLOW  The resulting file offset cannot be represented in an off_t.
 *   ESPIPE     fd is associated with a pipe, socket, or FIFO.
