/****************************************************************************
 * Name: ftruncate
 *
 * Description:
 *   The ftruncate() function causes the regular file referenced by fd to
 *   have a size of length bytes.
 *
 *   If the file previously was larger than length, the extra data is
 *   discarded.  If it was previously shorter than length, it is unspecified
 *   whether the file is changed or its size increased.  If the file is
 *   extended, the extended area appears as if it were zero-filled.  If fd
 *   references a shared memory object, ftruncate() sets the size of the
 *   shared memory object to length. If the file is not a regular file or
 *   a shared memory object, the result is unspecified.

 *   With ftruncate(), the file must be open for writing; for truncate(),
 *   the process must have write permission for the file.
 *
 *   ftruncate() does not modify the file offset for any open file
 *   descriptions associated with the file.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   fd     - A reference to an open, regular file or shared memory object
 *            to be truncated.
 *   length - The new length of the file or shared memory object.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *    Upon successful completion, ftruncate() return 0s. Otherwise a -1 is
 *    returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.
 *
 *    EINTR
 *      - A signal was caught during execution.
 *    EINVAL
 *      - The length argument was less than 0.
 *    EFBIG or EINVAL
 *      - The length argument was greater than the maximum file size.
 *    EIO
 *      - An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to a file
 *        system.
 *    EBADF or EINVAL
 *       - the fd argument is not a file descriptor open for writing.
 *    EFBIG
 *       - The file is a regular file and length is greater than the offset
 *         maximum established in the open file description associated with
 *         fd.
 *    EINVAL
 *       - The fd argument references a file that was opened without write
 *         permission.
 *    EROFS
 *       - The named file resides on a read-only file system.
