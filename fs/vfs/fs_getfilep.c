 * Name: fs_getfilep
 *
 * Description:
 *   Given a file descriptor, return the corresponding instance of struct
 *   file.  NOTE that this function will currently fail if it is provided
 *   with a socket descriptor.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   fd    - The file descriptor
 *   filep - The location to return the struct file instance
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success; a negated errno value is returned on
 *   any failure.
 *
