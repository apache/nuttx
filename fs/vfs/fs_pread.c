/****************************************************************************
 * Name: pread
 *
 * Description:
 *   The pread() function performs the same action as read(), except that it
 *   reads from a given position in the file without changing the file
 *   pointer. The first three arguments to pread() are the same as read()
 *   with the addition of a fourth argument offset for the desired position
 *   inside the file. An attempt to perform a pread() on a file that is
 *   incapable of seeking results in an error.
 *
 *   NOTE: This function could have been wholly implemented within libc but
 *   it is not.  Why?  Because if pread were implemented in libc, it would
 *   require four system calls.  If it is implemented within the kernel,
 *   only three.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   file     File structure instance
 *   buf      User-provided to save the data
 *   nbytes   The maximum size of the user-provided buffer
 *   offset   The file offset
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   The positive non-zero number of bytes read on success, 0 on if an
 *   end-of-file condition, or -1 on failure with errno set appropriately.
 *   See read() return values
 *
