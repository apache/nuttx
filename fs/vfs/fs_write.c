 * Name: file_write
 *
 * Description:
 *   Equivalent to the standard write() function except that is accepts a
 *   struct file instance instead of a file descriptor.  It is functionally
 *   equivalent to write() except that in addition to the differences in
 *   input parameters:
 *
 *  - It does not modify the errno variable,
 *  - It is not a cancellation point, and
 *  - It does not handle socket descriptors.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   filep  - Instance of struct file to use with the write
 *   buf    - Data to write
 *   nbytes - Length of data to write
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *  On success, the number of bytes written are returned (zero indicates
 *  nothing was written).  On any failure, a negated errno value is returned
 *  (see comments withwrite() for a description of the appropriate errno
 *  values).

 * Name: write
 *
 * Description:
 *  write() writes up to nytes bytes to the file referenced by the file
 *  descriptor fd from the buffer starting at buf.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   fd     - file descriptor (or socket descriptor) to write to
 *   buf    - Data to write
 *   nbytes - Length of data to write
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *  On success, the number of bytes written are returned (zero indicates
 *  nothing was written). On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appro-
 *  priately:
 *
 *  EAGAIN
 *    Non-blocking I/O has been selected using O_NONBLOCK and the write
 *    would block.
 *  EBADF
 *    fd is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for writing.
 *  EFAULT
 *    buf is outside your accessible address space.
 *  EFBIG
 *    An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the implementation
 *    defined maximum file size or the process's file size limit, or
 *    to write at a position past the maximum allowed offset.
 *  EINTR
 *    The call was interrupted by a signal before any data was written.
 *  EINVAL
 *    fd is attached to an object which is unsuitable for writing; or
 *    the file was opened with the O_DIRECT flag, and either the address
 *    specified in buf, the value specified in count, or the current
 *     file offset is not suitably aligned.
 *  EIO
 *    A low-level I/O error occurred while modifying the inode.
 *  ENOSPC
 *    The device containing the file referred to by fd has no room for
 *    the data.
 *  EPIPE
 *    fd is connected to a pipe or socket whose reading end is closed.
 *    When this happens the writing process will also receive a SIGPIPE
 *    signal. (Thus, the write return value is seen only if the program
 *    catches, blocks or ignores this signal.)
