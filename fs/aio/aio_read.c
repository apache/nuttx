/****************************************************************************
 * Name: aio_read
 *
 * Description:
 *   The aio_read() function reads aiocbp->aio_nbytes from the file
 *   associated with aiocbp->aio_fildes into the buffer pointed to by
 *   aiocbp->aio_buf. The function call will return when the read request
 *   has been initiated or queued to the file or device (even when the data
 *   cannot be delivered immediately).
 *
 *   If prioritized I/O is supported for this file, then the asynchronous
 *   operation will be submitted at a priority equal to a base scheduling
 *   priority minus aiocbp->aio_reqprio. If Thread Execution Scheduling is
 *   not supported, then the base scheduling priority is that of the calling
 *   thread (the latter is implemented at present).
 *
 *   The aiocbp value may be used as an argument to aio_error() and
 *   aio_return() in order to determine the error status and return status,
 *   respectively, of the asynchronous operation while it is proceeding. If
 *   an error condition is encountered during queuing, the function call
 *   will return without having initiated or queued the request. The
 *   requested operation takes place at the absolute position in the file as
 *   given by aio_offset, as if lseek() were called immediately prior to the
 *   operation with an offset equal to aio_offset and a whence equal to
 *   SEEK_SET. After a successful call to enqueue an asynchronous I/O
 *   operation, the value of the file offset for the file is unspecified.
 *
 *   The aiocbp->aio_lio_opcode field will be ignored by aio_read().
 *
 *   The aiocbp argument points to an aiocb structure. If the buffer pointed
 *   to by aiocbp->aio_buf or the control block pointed to by aiocbp becomes
 *   an illegal address prior to asynchronous I/O completion, then the
 *   behavior is undefined.
 *
 *   Simultaneous asynchronous operations using the same aiocbp produce
 *   undefined results.
 *
 *   For any system action that changes the process memory space while an
 *   synchronous I/O is outstanding to the address range being changed, the
 *   result of that action is undefined.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   aiocbp - A pointer to an instance of struct aiocb
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *
 *   The aio_read() function will return the value zero if the I/O operation
 *   is successfully queued; otherwise, the function will return the value
 *   -1 and set errno to indicate the error.  The aio_read() function will
 *   ail if:
 *
 *   EAGAIN - The requested asynchronous I/O operation was not queued due to
 *     system resource limitations.
 *
 *   Each of the following conditions may be detected synchronously at the
 *   time of the call to aio_read(), or asynchronously. If any of the
 *   conditions below are detected synchronously, the aio_read() function
 *   will return -1 and set errno to the corresponding value. If any of the
 *   conditions below are detected asynchronously, the return status of the
 *   asynchronous operation is set to -1, and the error status of the
 *   asynchronous operation is set to the corresponding value.
 *
 *   EBADF - The aiocbp->aio_fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor
 *     open for reading.
 *   EINVAL - The file offset value implied by aiocbp->aio_offset would be
 *     invalid, aiocbp->aio_reqprio is not a valid value, or
 *     aiocbp->aio_nbytes is an invalid value.
 *
 *   In the case that the aio_read() successfully queues the I/O operation
 *   but the operation is subsequently canceled or encounters an error, the
 *   return status of the asynchronous operation is one of the values
 *   normally returned by the read() function call. In addition, the error
 *   status of the asynchronous operation is set to one of the error
 *   statuses normally set by the read() function call, or one of the
 *   following values:
 *
 *   EBADF - The aiocbp->aio_fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor
 *     open for reading.
 *   ECANCELED - The requested I/O was canceled before the I/O completed
 *     due to an explicit aio_cancel() request.
 *   EINVAL - The file offset value implied by aiocbp->aio_offset would be
 *     invalid.
 *
 * The following condition may be detected synchronously or asynchronously:
 *
 *   EOVERFLOW - The file is a regular file, aiobcp->aio_nbytes is greater
 *     than 0, and the starting offset in aiobcp->aio_offset is before the
 *     end-of-file and is at or beyond the offset maximum in the open file
 *     description associated with aiocbp->aio_fildes.
 *
 * POSIX Compliance:
 * - Most errors required in the standard are not detected at this point.
 *   There are no pre-queuing checks for the validity of the operation.
