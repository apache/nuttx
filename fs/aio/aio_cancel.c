 * Name: aio_cancel
 *
 * Description:
 *   The aio_cancel() function attempts to cancel one or more asynchronous
 *   I/O requests currently outstanding against file descriptor 'fildes'.
 *   The aiocbp argument points to the asynchronous I/O control block for
 *   a particular request to be canceled. If aiocbp is NULL, then all
 *   outstanding cancelable asynchronous I/O requests against fildes will
 *   be canceled.
 *
 *   Normal asynchronous notification will occur for asynchronous I/O
 *   operations that are successfully canceled. If there are requests that
 *   cannot be canceled, then the normal asynchronous completion process
 *   will take place for those requests when they are completed.
 *
 *   For requested operations that are successfully canceled, the associated
 *   error status will be set to ECANCELED and the return status will be -1.
 *   For requested operations that are not successfully canceled, the aiocbp
 *   will not be modified by aio_cancel().
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   fildes - Not used in this implementation
 *   aiocbp - Points to the asynchronous I/O control block for a particular
 *            request to be canceled.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *    The aio_cancel() function will return the value AIO_CANCELED if the
 *    requested operation(s) were canceled. The value AIO_NOTCANCELED will
 *    be returned if at least one of the requested operation(s) cannot be
 *    canceled because it is in progress. In this case, the state of the
 *    other operations, if any, referenced in the call to aio_cancel() is
 *    not indicated by the return value of aio_cancel(). The application
 *    may determine the state of affairs for these operations by using
 *    aio_error(). The value AIO_ALLDONE is returned if all of the
 *    operations have already completed. Otherwise, the function will return
 *    -1 and set errno to indicate the error.
