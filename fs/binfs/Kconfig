config FS_BINFS
	bool "BINFS File System"
	default n
	depends on BUILTIN
	---help---
		The BINFS file system is provides access to builtin applications through
		the NuttX file system.  The BINFS may, for example, be mount at /bin.
		Then all of the built-in applications will appear as executable files in
		/bin.  Then, for example, you list them from NSH like:

		nsh> ls -l /bin

		If the BINFS BINFMT loader is also enabled, then the builtin applications
		can be executed through the normal mechanisms (posix_spawn(), exev(), etc.)
