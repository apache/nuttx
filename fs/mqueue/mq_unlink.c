 * Name: mq_unlink
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function removes the message queue named by "mq_name." If one
 *   or more tasks have the message queue open when mq_unlink() is called,
 *   removal of the message queue is postponed until all references to the
 *   message queue have been closed.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   mq_name - Name of the message queue
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *
