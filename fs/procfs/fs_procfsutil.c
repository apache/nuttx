 * Name: procfs_memcpy
 *
 * Description:
 *   procfs/ file data may be read by the user with different user buffer
 *   sizes to receive the data.  If the amount of data to be returned is
 *   large or if the callers receive buffer is small, then multiple read
 *   operations will be required.
 *
 *   If multiple read operations are required, then each read operation will
 *   be identical accept that file position (f_pos) will be incremented with
 *   each read:  f_pos must be incremented by the read method after each
 *   read operation to provide the 'offset' for the next read.
 *
 *   procfs_memcpy() is a helper function.  Each read() method should
 *   provide data in a local data buffer ('src' and 'srclen').  This
 *   will transfer the data to the user receive buffer ('dest' and
 *   'destlen'), respecting both (1) the size of the destination buffer so
 *   that it will write beyond the user receiver and (1) the file position,
 *   'offset'.
 *
 *   This function will skip over data until the under of bytes specified
 *   by 'offset' have been skipped.  Then it will transfer data from the
 *   the procfs/ 'src' buffer into the user receive buffer.  No more than
 *   'destlen' bytes will be transferred.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   src     - The address of the intermediate procfs/ buffer containing the
 *             data to be returned.
 *   srclen  - The number of bytes of data in the 'src' buffer
 *   dest    - The address of the user's receive buffer.
 *   destlen - The size (in bytes) of the user's receive buffer.
 *   offset  - On input, this is the number of bytes to skip before returning
 *             data;  If bytes were skipped, this offset will be decremented.
 *             Data will not be transferred until this offset decrements to
 *             zero.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   The number of bytes actually transferred into the user's receive buffer.
