config FS_UNIONFS
	bool "Union File System"
	default n
	---help---
		The Union file system is provides a mechanism to overlay two
		different, mounted file systems so that they appear as one.  In
		general this works like this:

			1) Mount file system 1 at some location, say /mnt/file1
			2) Mount file system 2 at some location, say /mnt/file2
			3) Call unionfs_mount() to combine and overly /mnt/file1 and
			mnt/file2 as a new mount point, say /mnt/unionfs.

		/mnt/file1 and /mnt/file2 will disappear and be replaced by the
		single mountpoint /mnut/unionfs.  The previous contents under
		/mnt/file1 and /mnt/file2 will appear merged under /mnt/unionfs.
		Files at the same relative path in file system1 will take presence.
		If another file of the same name and same relative location exists
		in file system 2, it will not be visible because it will be occluded
		by the file in file system1.

		See include/nutts/unionfs.h for additional information.
