 * Name: file_close
 *
 * Description:
 *   Close a file that was previously opend with file_open() (or detached
 *   with file_detach()).
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   filep - A pointer to a user provided memory location containing the
 *           open file data returned by file_detach().
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success; A negated errno value is returned on
 *   any failure to indicate the nature of the failure.
