config DISABLE_MOUNTPOINT
	bool "Disable support for mount points"
	default n

config FS_AUTOMOUNTER
	bool "Auto-mounter"
	default n
	depends on !DISABLE_MOUNTPOINT
	---help---
		The automounter provides an OS-internal mechanism for automatically
		mounting and unmounting removable media as the media is inserted and
		removed.  See include/nuttx/fs/automout.h for interfacing details.

config FS_AUTOMOUNTER_DEBUG
	bool "Auto-mounter debug"
	default n
	depends on FS_AUTOMOUNTER && DEBUG
	---help---
		Normally, the auto-mounter will generate debug output when sub-system
		level file system debug is enabled.  This option will select debug
		output from the logic related to the auto-mount feature even when file
		system debug is not enable.  This is useful primarily for in vivo
		unit testing of the auto-mount feature.

config DISABLE_PSEUDOFS_OPERATIONS
	bool "Disable pseudo-filesystem operations"
	default y if DEFAULT_SMALL
	default n if !DEFAULT_SMALL
	---help---
		Disable certain operations on pseudo-file systems include mkdir,
		rmdir, unlink, and rename.  These are necessary for the logical
		completeness of the illusion created by the pseudo-filesystem.
		However, in practical embedded system, they are seldom needed and
		you can save a little FLASH space by disabling the capability.

config FS_READABLE
	bool
	default n

config SYSLOG
	bool "Advanced SYSLOG features"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables generic system logging features.  NOTE: This setting is not
		required to enable system logging.  If this feature is not enable
		system logging will still be available and will log to the system
		console (like printf()).  This setting is required to enable
		customization of the basic system loggin capability.

config SYSLOG_TIMESTAMP
	bool "Prepend timestamp to syslog message"
	default n
	---help---
		Prepend timestamp to syslog message.

if SYSLOG

config SYSLOG_CHAR
	bool "System log character device support"
	default y
	---help---
		Enable the generic character device for the SYSLOG. The full path to the
		SYSLOG device is provided by SYSLOG_DEVPATH. A valid character device (or
		file) must exist at this path.  It will by opened by syslog_initialize.

		Do not enable more than one SYSLOG device.

config SYSLOG_DEVPATH
	string "System log device"
	default "/dev/syslog"
	depends on SYSLOG_CHAR
	---help---
		The full path to the system logging device.  For the RAMLOG SYSLOG device,
		this is normally "/dev/ramlog".  For character SYSLOG devices, it should be
		some other existing character device (or file) supported by the configuration
		(such as "/dev/ttyS1")/
