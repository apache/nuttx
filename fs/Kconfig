config DISABLE_MOUNTPOINT
	bool "Disable support for mount points"
	default n

config FS_AUTOMOUNTER
	bool "Auto-mounter"
	default n
	depends on !DISABLE_MOUNTPOINT
	select SCHED_LPWORK
	---help---
		The automounter provides an OS-internal mechanism for automatically
		mounting and unmounting removable media as the media is inserted and
		removed.  See include/nuttx/fs/automout.h for interfacing details.

config FS_AUTOMOUNTER_DEBUG
	bool "Auto-mounter debug"
	default n
	depends on FS_AUTOMOUNTER && DEBUG_FEATURES
	---help---
		Normally, the auto-mounter will generate debug output when sub-system
		level file system debug is enabled.  This option will select debug
		output from the logic related to the auto-mount feature even when file
		system debug is not enable.  This is useful primarily for in vivo
		unit testing of the auto-mount feature.

config DISABLE_PSEUDOFS_OPERATIONS
	bool "Disable pseudo-filesystem operations"
	default y if DEFAULT_SMALL
	default n if !DEFAULT_SMALL
	---help---
		Disable certain operations on pseudo-file systems include mkdir,
		rmdir, unlink, and rename.  These are necessary for the logical
		completeness of the illusion created by the pseudo-filesystem.
		However, in practical embedded system, they are seldom needed and
		you can save a little FLASH space by disabling the capability.

config PSEUDOFS_SOFTLINKS
	bool "Pseudo-filesystem soft links"
	default n
	depends on !DISABLE_PSEUDOFS_OPERATIONS
	---help---
		Enable support for soft links in the pseudo file system.  Soft
		links are not supported within mounted volumes by any NuttX file
		system.  However, if this option is selected, then soft links
		may be add in the pseudo file system.  This might be useful, for
		to link a directory in the pseudo-file system, such as /bin, to
		to a directory in a mounted volume, say /mnt/sdcard/bin.
