config FS_SPIFFS
	bool "SPIFFS File System"
	default n
	depends on !DISABLE_MOUNTPOINT && ALLOW_BSD_COMPONENTS
	select FS_LARGEFILE
	---help---
		Build the SPIFFS file system.  This is a port of version 0.3.7 of
		the SPIFFS file system by  Peter Andersson.  It was originally
		released under the MIT license.

comment "In-memory Cache Options"

config SPIFFS_CACHE_SIZE
	int "Size of the cache"
	default 8192

config SPIFFS_CACHE_HITSCORE
	int "Cache Hit Score"
	default 4
	range 1 255
	---help---
		Temporal file cache hit score. Each time a file is opened, all
		cached files will lose one point. If the opened file is found in
		cache, that entry will gain CONFIG_SPIFFS_CACHE_HITSCORE points.
		One can experiment with this value for the specific access patterns
		of the application. However, it must be between 1 (no gain for
		hitting a cached entry often) and 255.

config SPIFFS_CACHEDBG
	bool "Enable cache debug output"
	default n
	depends on DEBUG_FS_INFO
	---help---
		Dumps cache debug output.  Depends on CONFIG_DEBUG_FS_INFO

comment "Garbage Collection (GC) Options"

config SPIFFS_GC_MAXRUNS
	int "Max GC runs"
	default 5
	---help---
		Define maximum number of gc runs to perform to reach desired free
		pages.

config SPIFFS_GC_DELWGT
	int "Deleted pages weight"
	default 5
	---help---
		Garbage collecting examines all pages in a block which and sums up
		to a block score. Deleted pages normally gives positive score and
		used pages normally gives a negative score (as these must be moved).
		To have a fair wear-leveling, the erase age is also included in
		score, whose factor normally is the most positive.  The larger the
		score, the more likely it is that the block will picked for garbage
		collection.

		This option provides the weight used for deleted pages.

config SPIFFS_GC_USEDWGT
	int "Used pages weight"
	default -1
	---help---
		Garbage collecting examines all pages in a block which and sums up
		to a block score. Deleted pages normally gives positive score and
		used pages normally gives a negative score (as these must be moved).
		To have a fair wear-leveling, the erase age is also included in
		score, whose factor normally is the most positive.  The larger the
		score, the more likely it is that the block will picked for garbage
		collection.

		This option provides the weight used for used pages.

config SPIFFS_GC_ERASEAGEWGT
	int "Used pages weight"
	default 50
	---help---
		Garbage collecting examines all pages in a block which and sums up
		to a block score. Deleted pages normally gives positive score and
		used pages normally gives a negative score (as these must be moved).
		To have a fair wear-leveling, the erase age is also included in
		score, whose factor normally is the most positive.  The larger the
		score, the more likely it is that the block will picked for garbage
		collection.

		This option provides the weight used weight used for time between
		last erased and erase of this block.

config SPIFFS_GCDBG
	bool "Enable garbage collection debug output"
	default n
	depends on DEBUG_FS_INFO
	---help---
		Dumps garbage collection debug output.  Depends on CONFIG_DEBUG_FS_INFO

comment "Consistency Check Options"

config SPIFFS_CHECK_ONMOUNT
	bool "Consistency check on mount"
	default n
	select SPIFFS_CHECK_OUTPUT
	---help---
		Perhaps a full, extended consistency check on mount.  By default, a
		simple scan of the file system only is performed.

config SPIFFS_CHECK_OUTPUT
	bool "Enable consistency check SYSLOG output"
	default n

config SPIFFS_DUMP
	bool "Dump Logical FLASH Content"
	default n
	depends on SPIFFS_CHECK_OUTPUT
	---help---
		Enables support for the FIOC_DUMP IOCTL command which will dump a
		terse summary of the state of each FLASH page.

comment "MTD Interface Options"

config SPIFFS_MTDDBG
	bool "Enable MTD Interface DEBUG"
	default n
	depends on DEBUG_FS_INFO
	---help---
		Dumps MTD debug output.  Depends on CONFIG_DEBUG_FS_INFO

config SPIFFS_MTDDUMP
	bool "Enable MTD Data Dump"
	default n
	depends on SPIFFS_MTDDBG
	---help---
		Dumps every byte of data going to and coming from FLASH.  You
		probably do not want this unless you are debugging a particular
		MTD interfacing issue.

comment "SPIFFS Core Options"

config SPIFFS_NO_BLIND_WRITES
	bool "No blind writes"
	default n
	---help---
		By default SPIFFS in some cases relies on the property of NOR flash
		that bits cannot be set from 0 to 1 by writing and that controllers
		will ignore such bit changes. This results in fewer reads as SPIFFS
		can in some cases perform blind writes, with all bits set to 1 and
		only those it needs reset set to 0.  Most of the chips and
		controllers allow this behavior, so the default is to use this
		technique. If your controller is one of the rare ones that don't,
		turn this option on and SPIFFS will perform a read-modify-write
		instead.

config SPIFFS_PAGE_CHECK
	bool "Check Page Headers"
	default y
	---help---
		Always check header of each accessed page to ensure consistent state.
		If enabled it will increase number of reads, will increase flash.

config SPIFFS_NAME_MAX
	int "Maximum Name Length"
	default 32
	---help---
		Object name maximum length. Note that this length include the zero
		termination character, meaning maximum string of characters.

		Note: This config affects the on-flash structure.

config SPIFFS_COPYBUF_STACK
	int "Max Stack Allocation"
	default 64
	---help---
		Size of buffer allocated on stack used when copying data.  Lower
		value generates more read/writes.  No meaning having it bigger
		than logical page size.

config SPIFFS_COMPAT_OLD_NUTTX
	bool "Compatibility with older NuttX SPIFFS"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable the compatibility with older NuttX versions.
		(Older than NuttX 11.0.0, where this option was introduced.)

		Note: For better compatibility, you may want to disable
		CONFIG_SPIFFS_LEADING_SLASH because those versions of NuttX
		didn't have the option.

		Note: This config affects the on-flash structure.

config SPIFFS_LEADING_SLASH
	bool "Prefix every filename with a slash"
	default y
	---help---
		Assume and ensure that on-flash filenames are always prefixed
		with a slash.
		This enables the compatibility with images generated by
		the following tools:

			* mkspiffs
			* ESP-IDF spiffsgen.py

		Note: SPIFFS_NAME_MAX doesn't include the leading slash appended
		by this option.

		Note: This config affects the on-flash structure.
