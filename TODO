o Task/Scheduler (sched/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: When a tasks exits, shouldn't all of its child pthreads also be
               terminated?
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium, required for good emulation of process/pthread model.

  Description: atexit() supports registration of one function called on exit().
               Should task_delete() also cause atexit() function to be called?
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low, task_delete() is non-standard and its behavior is
               unspecified.

  Description: Implement sys/mman.h and functions
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: Implement sys/wait.h and functions.  Consider implementing wait,
               waitpid, waitid.  At present, a parent has no information about
               child tasks.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: Several APIs do not set errno.  Need to review all APIs.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium, required for standard compliance (but makes the
               code bigger)

  Description: socket descriptors are not cloned as are file descriptors
               by task_create().
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium-to-High

o Dynamic Loader
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: At some point in the future, I intend to port the XFLAT
               dynamic loader into NuttX (see http://xflat.sourceforge.net/).
               That would allow NuttX to dynamically load and link
               external code in a mounted filesystem.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low, Nice feature and I might do it someday

o Memory Managment (mm/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: Add an option to free all memory allocated by a task when the
               task exits. This is probably not be worth the overhead for a
               deeply embedded system.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium/Low, a good feature to prevent memory leaks but would
               have negative impact on memory usage and code size.

  Description: Current logic adapts size_t for 16-bit address machines vs.
               32-bit address machines.  But a small memory option should also
               be provided so that the small offset option can be used with
               32-bit machines that have small RAM memories (like the lpc2148)
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    High, a good feature enhancement.

o Signals (sched/, arch/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: 'Standard' signals and signal actions are not supported.
               (e.g., SIGINT, SIGCHLD, SIGSEGV, etc).
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low, required by standards but not so critical for an
               embedded system.

o pthreads (sched/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: pthread_cancel():  Should implement cancellation points and
               pthread_testcancel()
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low, probably not that useful

o C++ Support
  ^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: Need to call static constructors
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low, depends on toolchain.  Call to gcc's built-in static
               constructor logic will probably have to be performed by
               user logic in user_start().

o Network (net/, netutils/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: One critical part of netutils/ apps is untested: The uIP
               resolver in netutils/resolv.  The webclient code has been
               tested on host using gethosbyname(), but still depends on the
               untested resolve logic.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium, Important but not core NuttX functionality

  Description: Should implement SOCK_RAW, SOCK_PACKET
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: uIP polling issues / Multiple network interface support:
               (1) Current logic will not support multiple ethernet drivers.
                  Each driver should poll on TCP connections connect on the
                  network supported by the driver; UDP polling should respond
                  with TX data only if the UDP packet is intended for the
                  the network supported by the driver.
               (2) If there were multiple drivers, polling would occur at
                  double the rate.  Fix by using bound IP address in TCP
                  connection (lipaddr) and verifying that it is in the subnet
                  served by the driver.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium, The feature is not important, but it is important
               for NuttX to resolve the architectural issues.

  Description: Sendoto() and multiple network interface support:
               When polled, would have to assure that the destination IP
               is on the subnet served by the polling driver.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium, The feature is not important, but it is important
               for NuttX to resolve the architectural issues.

  Description: IPv6 support is incomplete.  Adam Dunkels has recently announced
               IPv6 support for uIP (currently only as part of Contiki).  Those
               changes need to be ported to NuttX.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: Incoming UDP broadcast should only be accepted if listening on
               INADDR_ANY(?)
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: Read-ahead buffers capture incoming TCP data when no user
               thread is recv-ing the data.  Should add some driver call to
               support throttling; when there is no listener for new data, the
               driver should be throttled.  Perhaps the driver should disable
               RX interrupts when throttled and re-anable on each poll time.
               recvfrom would, of course, have to un-throttle.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: Need to standardize collection of statistics from network
               drivers.  examples/nsh ifconfig command should present
               statistics.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: Outgoing packets are dropped and overwritten by ARP packets
               if the destination IP has not been mapped to a MAC.  Could
               improve send() performance by explicitly performing ARP before
               sending the packet.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: Port PPP support from http://contiki.cvs.sourceforge.net/contiki/contiki-2.x/backyard/core/net/ppp/
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: At present, there cannot be two concurrent active TCP send
               operations in progress using the same socket.  This is because
               the uIP ACK logic will support only one transfer at a time.  The
               solution is simple: A mutex will be needed to make sure that each 
               send that is started is able to be the exclusive sender until all of
               the data to be sent has been ACKed.
  Status:      Open.  There is some temporary logic to examples/nsh that does
               this same fix and that temporary logic should be removed when
               send() is fixed.
  Priority:    Medium-Low.  This is an important issue for applications that
               send on the same TCP socket from multiple threads.

  Description: TCP supports read-ahead buffering to handle the receipt of
               TCP/IP packets when there is no read() in place.  Should such
               capability be useful for UDP?  PRO: Would reduce packet loss
               and enable support for poll()/select().  CON: UDP is inherently
               lossy so why waste memory footprint?
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: poll()/select() is not implemented for UDP sockets because they do
               do not support read-ahead buffering.  Therefore, there is never
               a case where you can read from a UDP socket without blocking.
  Status:      Open, depends on UDP read-ahead support
  Priority:    Medium

o USB (drivers/usbdev)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: The USB bulk storage class driver configuration (examples/usbstorage)
               does not work reliably when debug is disabled (CONFIG_DEBUG+CONFIG_DEBUG_VERBOSE
               +CONFIG_DEBUG_USB) on WinXP (Linux appears to be fine).  A race condition would
               would be a possibility.  The symptom is that that WinXP sends a MODE SENSE (6)
               command with an unsupported mode page (0x1c/0x00)
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    High

o Libraries (lib/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: sscanf() and lib_vsprintf() do not support floating point
               values.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: The definition of environ in stdlib.h is bogus and will not
               work as it should.  This is because the underlying
               representation of the environment is not an arry of pointers.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: fgets implementation does not use C-buffered I/O, but rather
               talks to serial driver directly via read().  It includes VT-100
               specific editting commands.  This gets should be renamed readlin()
               and a more generic fgets() should be implemented.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low (unless you are using mixed C-buffered I/O with fgets and
               fgetc, for example).

  Description: Need some minimal termios support... at a minimum, enough to
               switch between raw and "normal" modes to support behavior like
               that needed for readline().
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

o File system / Generic drivers (fs/, drivers/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: Implement chmod(), truncate().
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: FAT: long file names
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: The CAN driver is untested.  Add a test for the CAN driver.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: At present, the CAN driver does not support the poll() method.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: There is no way to remove a FIFO or PIPE created in the
               psuedo filesystem.  Once created, they persist indefinitely
               and cannot be unlinked.  This is actually a more generic
               issue:  unlink does not work for anything in the psuedo-
               filesystem.
  Status:      Open, but partially resolved: pipe buffer is at least freed
               when there are not open references to the pipe/FIFO.
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: The ROMFS file system does not verify checksums on either
               volume header on on the individual files.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low.  I have mixed feelings about if NuttX should pay a
               performance penalty for better data integrity.

  Description: The simple SPI based MMCS/SD driver in fs/mmcsd does not
               yet handle multiple block transfers.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium-Low

o Graphics subystem (graphics/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: If CONFIG_NX is enabled, the build fails the first time
               saying that there is "No rule to make target..." for one of the
               auto-generated graphics files.  This is a nuisance, but if you
               simply build again (with the source files already auto-generated)
               the problem does not reoccur.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low, the work-around is simple

  Description: Testing of all APIs is not complete.  See
               http://nuttx.sourceforge.net/NXGraphicsSubsystem.html#testcoverage
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

o Pascal Add-On (pcode/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: Need APIs to verify execution of P-Code from memory buffer.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: Loader and object format may be too large for some small
               memory systems.  Consider ways to reduce memory footprint.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

o Documentation (Documentation/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

o Build system
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: Some names under arch are still incorrect.  These should be
               processor architecture names:  pjrc-8051 should be 805x
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: configs/pjrc-8051 should be configs/pjrc-87c52
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: Dependencies do not work correctly under configs/<board>/src
               (same as arch/<arch>/src/board).
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium (maybe higher for z80 target)

  Description: It would be nice to de-couple some of the behaviors enabled by
               CONFIG_DEBUG.  For example, CONFIG_DEBUG turns on debug output,
               but also disables optimization make the binary much bigger.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low.  There workaround is easy.. just edit the configuration's
               Make.def file to control the behavior that you want.

  Description: Need a NuttX configuration tool.  The number of configuration
               settings has become quite large and difficult to manage manually.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium-low

o NuttShell (NSH) (examples/nsh)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: When the telnetd front end is received, each TCP packet
               received causes a prompt (nsh >) to be presented.  The
               prompt should only be presented when the user enters a
               carriage return.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: The wget command has been incorporated into NSH, however
               it is still untested as of this writing (only because I
               have not had the correct network setup for the testing
               yet).  Since wget depends on the also untest uIP resolv/
               logic, it is like non-functional.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Med-High

o Other Applications & Tests (examples/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: The redirection test (part of examples/pipe) terminates
               incorrectly on the Cywgin-based simulation platform (but works
               fine on the Linux-based simulation platform).
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: examples/wget is untested on the target (it has been tested
               on the host, but not in the target using the uIP resolv logic).
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Med

  Description: examples/sendmail is untested on the target (it has been tested
               on the host, but not on the target.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Med


o Linux/Cywgin simulation (arch/sim)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: The simulated serial driver has some odd behavior.  It
               will stall for a long time on reads when the C stdio buffers are
               being refilled. This only effects the behavior of things like
               fgetc().  Workaround: Set CONFIG_STDIO_BUFFER_SIZE=0, suppressing
               all C buffered I/O.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low (because the simulator is only a test/development platform)

o ARM (arch/arm/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: ARM interrupt handling performance could be improved in many
               ways.  One easy way is to use a pointer to the context save
               area in current_regs instead of using up_copystate so much.
               see handling of 'current_regs" in arch/sh/src/common/* for
               examples of how this might be done.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: The ARM interrupt handler restores all regisers upon return.
               This could be improved as well:  If there is not context
               switch, then the static registers need not be restored
               because they will not be modified by the called C code.
               (see arch/sh/src/sh1/sh1_vector.S for example)
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

o ARM/C5471 (arch/arm/src/c5471/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: UART re-configuration is untested and conditionally compiled out.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium.  ttyS1 is not configured, but not used; ttyS0 is configured
               by the bootloader

o ARM/DM320 (arch/arm/src/dm320/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: config/ntos-dm320: It seems that when a lot of debug statements
               are added, the system no longer boots.  This is suspected to be
               a stack problem: Making the stack bigger or removing arrays on
               the stack seems to fix the problem (might also be the
               bootloader overwriting memory)
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: A USB device controller driver was added but has never been tested.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: A framebuffer "driver" was added, however, it remains untested.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: In order to use the framebuffer "driver" additional video encoder
               logic is required to setupt composite video output or to interface
               with an LCD.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium (high if you need to use the framebuffer driver)

o ARM/i.MX (arch/arm/src/imx/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: The basic port of the i.MX1 architecuture is underway.  The port
               is incomplete (as of this writing, is still lacks a timer, interrupt
               decoding, USB, network) and untested.
  Status:      Open (and in work)
  Priority:    Medium (high if you need i.MX1/L support)

  Description: SPI methods are not thread safe.  Needs a semaphore to protect from re-entrancy.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium -- Will be very high if you do SPI access from multiple threads.

o ARM/LPC214x (arch/arm/src/lpc214x/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: Should use Vector Interrupts
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: USB DMA not fully implemented. Partial logic is in place but it is
               fragmentary and bogus.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: USB Serial Driver reports wrong error when opened before the
               USB is connected (reports EBADF instead of ENOTCONN)
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: The USB bulk storage class driver configuration (examples/usbstorage)
               does not work reliably when debug is disabled (CONFIG_DEBUG+CONFIG_DEBUG_VERBOSE
               +CONFIG_DEBUG_USB) on WinXP (Linux appears to be fine).  A race condition would
               would be a possibility.  The symptom is that that WinXP sends a MODE SENSE (6)
               command with an unsupported mode page (0x1c/0x00)
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    High

  Description: At present the SPI driver is polled.  Should it be interrupt driven?
               Look at arch/arm/src/imx/imx_spi.c -- that is a good example of an
               interrupt driven SPI driver.  Should be very easy to part that architecture
               to the LPC.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: SPI methods are not thread safe.  Needs a semaphore to protect from re-entrancy.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium -- Will be very high if you do SPI access from multiple threads.

  Description: At present the SPI driver is polled -AND- there is a rather large, arbitrary,
               delay in one of the block access routines.  The purpose of the delay is to
               avoid a race conditions.  This begs for a re-design -OR- at a minimum, some
               optimiation of the delay time.

  Desription:  I am unable to initialize a 2Gb SanDisk microSD card (in adaptor) on the
               the mcu123 board.  The card fails to accept CMD0.  Doesn't seem like a software
               issue, but if anyone else sees the problem, I'd like to know.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Uncertain

o ARM/STR71x (arch/arm/src/str71x/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: Add SPI driver and integrate with MMC/SD support. This effort is stalled
               at the moment because the slot on the Olimex board only accepts MMC card;
               I have not MMC cards, only SD cards which won't fit into the slot.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: Develop a USB driver and integrate with existing USB serial and storage
               class drivers.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: SPI methods are not thread safe.  Needs a semaphore to protect from re-entrancy.

o Hitachi/Renesas SH-1 (arch/sh/src/sh1)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description:  There are instabilities that make the SH-1 port un-usable.  The
                nature of these is not understood; the behavior is that certain SH-1
                instructions stop working as advertised.  I have seen the following
                examples:

                  412b jmp @r1 - Set a return address in PR, i.e., it behaved like
                       410b jsr @r1.  Normally 412b works correctly, but in the failure
                       condition, it reliably set the PR.
                  69F6 mov.l @r15+,r9 - wrote the value of R1 to @r15+.  This behavior
                       does not correspond to any known SH-1 instruction

                This could be a silicon problem, some pipeline issue that is not
                handled properly by the gcc 3.4.5 toolchain (which has very limit
                SH-1 support to begin with), or perhaps with the CMON debugger.  At
                any rate, I have exhausted all of the energy that I am willing to put
                into this cool old processor for the time being.

  Description: The simulated Z80 serial console (configs/z80sim/src/z80_serial.c +

  Description: When the interrupt-driven serial driver is used, the system

               latching, level-sensitive TX ready interrupt.

               With -reduceopt on the command line, I can get the printf output.
               However, there are still errors in the compiled code -- specifically
               in sched/timer_create.c.

               I have submitted a bug report to ZiLOG for this (support incident

  Description: The pascal add-on does not work with the z16f (that is

               SYSIO 0, WRITESTR a large case statement is executed.  This
               involves a call into the ZiLOG runtime library to __uwcase().
               __uwcase is passed a pointer to a structure containing jump
               information.  The cause of the failure appears to be that
               the referenced switch data is bad.
               This is submited as ZiLOG support incident 81459.

               Summary of ZiLOG analysis: "This is a ZNEO run time library problem.

               If the customer does not want to modify uwcase.asm then the other
