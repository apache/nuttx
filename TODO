o Task/Scheduler (sched/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: When a tasks exits, shouldn't all of its child pthreads also be
               terminated?
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium, required for good emulation of process/pthread model.

  Description: atexit() supports registration of only single function called on
               exit().  It should support multiple functions registered by atexit()
               or onexit() and these should be called in reverse order of
               registration when the task exits.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: Implement sys/mman.h and functions
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: Implement sys/wait.h and functions.  Consider implementing wait,
               waitpid, waitid.  At present, a parent has no information about
               child tasks.
               Update: A simple but usable version of waitpid() has been included.
               This version is not compliant with all specifications and can be
               enabled with CONFIG_SCHED_WAITPID. 
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: Several APIs do not set errno.  Need to review all APIs.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium, required for standard compliance (but makes the
               code bigger)

o On-demand paging (sched/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: On-demand paging has recently been incorporated into the RTOS.
               The design of this feature is described here:
               http://www.nuttx.org/NuttXDemandPaging.html.
               As of this writing, the basic feature implementation is
               complete and much of the logic has been verified.  The test
               harness for the feature exists only for the NXP LPC3131 (see
               configs/ea3131/pgnsh and locked directories).  There are
               some limitations of this testing so I still cannot say that
               the feature is fully functional.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium-Low

o Other core OS logic
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: get_environ_ptr() (sched/sched_getenvironptr.c) is not implemented.
               The representation of the the environment strings selected for
               NutX is not compatible with the operation.  Some significant
               re-design would be required to implement this funcion and that
               effort is thought to be not worth the result.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low -- There is no plan to implement this.

  Description: timer_getoverrun() (sched/timer_getoverrun.c) is not implemented.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low -- There is no plan to implement this.

o Memory Managment (mm/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: Add an option to free all memory allocated by a task when the
               task exits. This is probably not be worth the overhead for a
               deeply embedded system.
               There would be complexities with this implementation as well
               because often one task allocates memory and then passes the
               memory to another:  The task that "owns" the memory may not
               be the same as the task that allocated the memory.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium/Low, a good feature to prevent memory leaks but would
               have negative impact on memory usage and code size.

o Signals (sched/, arch/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: 'Standard' signals and signal actions are not supported.
               (e.g., SIGINT, SIGCHLD, SIGSEGV, etc).
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low, required by standards but not so critical for an
               embedded system.

o pthreads (sched/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: pthread_cancel():  Should implement cancellation points and
               pthread_testcancel()
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low, probably not that useful

o C++ Support
  ^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: Need to call static constructors
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low, depends on toolchain.  Call to gcc's built-in static
               constructor logic will probably have to be performed by
               user logic in user_start().

o Binary loaders (binfmt/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: Not all of the NXFLAT test under apps/examples/nxflat are working.
               Most simply do not compile yet.  tests/mutex runs okay but
               outputs garbage on completion.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    High

  Description: The ARM up_getpicbase() does not seem to work.  This means
               the some features like wdog's might not work in NXFLAT modules.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium-High

  Description: At present, all .rodata must be put into RAM.  There is a 
               tentative design change that might allow .rodata to be placed
               in FLASH (see Documentation/NuttXNxFlat.html).
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: If the function pointer to a statically defined function is
               taken, then GCC generates a relocation that cannot be handled
               by NXFLAT.  There is a solution described in Documentataion/NuttXNxFlat.html,
               by that would require a compiler change (which we want to avoid).
               The simple workaround is to make such functions global in scope.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low (probably will not fix)

  Description: In the NXFLAT symbol tables... Using a 32-bit hash value instead
               of a string to identify a symbol should result in a smaller footprint.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: Windows build issue.  Some of the configurations that use NXFLAT have
               the linker script specified like this:

               NXFLATLDFLAGS2 = $(NXFLATLDFLAGS1) -T$(TOPDIR)/binfmt/libnxflat/gnu-nxflat.ld -no-check-sections


               That will not work for windows-based tools because they require Windows
               style paths.  The solution is to do something like this:

               if ($(WINTOOL)y)
                 NXFLATLDSCRIPT=${cygpath -w $(TOPDIR)/binfmt/libnxflat/gnu-nxflat.ld}
               else
                 NXFLATLDSCRIPT=$(TOPDIR)/binfmt/libnxflat/gnu-nxflat.ld
               endif
               
               Then use
               
               NXFLATLDFLAGS2 = $(NXFLATLDFLAGS1) -T"$(NXFLATLDSCRIPT)" -no-check-sections
               
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    There are too many references like the above.  They will have
               to get fixed as needed for Windows native tool builds.

o Network (net/, drivers/net)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: Should implement SOCK_RAW, SOCK_PACKET
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: uIP polling issues / Multiple network interface support:
               (1) Current logic will not support multiple ethernet drivers.
                  Each driver should poll on TCP connections connect on the
                  network supported by the driver; UDP polling should respond
                  with TX data only if the UDP packet is intended for the
                  the network supported by the driver.
               (2) If there were multiple drivers, polling would occur at
                  double the rate.  Fix by using bound IP address in TCP
                  connection (lipaddr) and verifying that it is in the subnet
                  served by the driver.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium, The feature is not important, but it is important
               for NuttX to resolve the architectural issues.

  Description: sendto() and multiple network interface support:
               When polled, would have to assure that the destination IP
               is on the subnet served by the polling driver.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium, The feature is not important, but it is important
               for NuttX to resolve the architectural issues.

  Description: IPv6 support is incomplete.  Adam Dunkels has recently announced
               IPv6 support for uIP (currently only as part of Contiki).  Those
               changes need to be ported to NuttX.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: Incoming UDP broadcast should only be accepted if listening on
               INADDR_ANY(?)
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: Read-ahead buffers capture incoming TCP data when no user
               thread is recv-ing the data.  Should add some driver call to
               support throttling; when there is no listener for new data, the
               driver should be throttled.  Perhaps the driver should disable
               RX interrupts when throttled and re-anable on each poll time.
               recvfrom would, of course, have to un-throttle.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: Need to standardize collection of statistics from network
               drivers.  apps/nshlib ifconfig command should present
               statistics.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: At present, there cannot be two concurrent active TCP send
               operations in progress using the same socket.  This is because
               the uIP ACK logic will support only one transfer at a time.  The
               solution is simple: A mutex will be needed to make sure that each 
               send that is started is able to be the exclusive sender until all of
               the data to be sent has been ACKed.
  Status:      Open.  There is some temporary logic to apps/nshlib that does
               this same fix and that temporary logic should be removed when
               send() is fixed.
  Priority:    Medium-Low.  This is an important issue for applications that
               send on the same TCP socket from multiple threads.

  Description: TCP supports read-ahead buffering to handle the receipt of
               TCP/IP packets when there is no read() in place.  Should such
               capability be useful for UDP?  PRO: Would reduce packet loss
               and enable support for poll()/select().  CON: UDP is inherently
               lossy so why waste memory footprint?
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: poll()/select() is not implemented for UDP sockets because they do
               do not support read-ahead buffering.  Therefore, there is never
               a case where you can read from a UDP socket without blocking.
  Status:      Open, depends on UDP read-ahead support
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: poll()/select() only works for availability of buffered TCP
               read data (when read-ahead is enabled).  The way writing is
               handled in uIP, all sockets must wait when send and cannot
               be notifiied when they can send without waiting.
  Status:      Open, probably will not be fixed.
  Priority:    Medium... this does effect porting of applications that expect
               different behavior from poll()/select()

  Description: sockets do not support all modes except for O_NONBLOCK. Sockets
               support only (1) TCP/IP non-blocking read operations when read-ahead
               buffering is enabled, and (2) TCP/IP accept() operations when TCP/IP
               connection backlog is enabled.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low.

  Description: I started coding a CrystalLan CS89x0 driver (drivers/net/cs89x0.c),
               but never finished it.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low unless you need it.

  Description: So far, I have not come up with a usable hardware platform to
               verify the ENC28J60 Ethernet driver (drivers/net/enc28j60.c).
               So it is untested.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low unless you need it.

  Description: Support for client-side IGMPv2 multicast has been added but not yet
               tested (because I don't have a proper environment for multicast testing).
               There are most likely errors that need to be fixed at least in the
               receipt of multicast packets.

               In addition, an ethernet driver that needs to work with the IGMP logic
               will have to include additional support for multicast MAC address tables.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low unless you need it.

  Description: The interfaces used to leave/join IGMP multicast groups is non-standard.
               RFC3678 (IGMPv3) suggests ioctl() commands to do this (SIOCSIPMSFILTER) but
               also status that those APIs are historic.  NuttX implements these ioctl
               commands, but is non-standard because:  (1) It does not support IGMPv3, and
               (2) it looks up drivers by their device name (eg., "eth0") vs IP address.

               Linux uses setsockopt() to control multicast group membership using the
               IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP and IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP options.  It also looks up drivers
               using IP addresses (It would require additional logic in NuttX to look up
               drivers by IP address).  See http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Multicast-HOWTO-6.html
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium.  All standards compatibility is important to NuttX.  However, most
               the mechanism for leaving and joining groups is hidden behind a wrapper
               function so that little of this incompatibilities need be exposed.

  Description: Many configurations have the MTU (CONFIG_NET_BUFSIZE) set to very small
               numbers, less then the minimum MTU size that must be supported -- 576.
               This can cause problems in some networks:  CONFIG_NET_BUFSIZE should
               be set to at least 576 in all defconfig files.

               The symptoms of using very small MTU sizes can be very strange.  With
               Ubuntu 9.x and vsFtpd was that the total packet size did *not match* the
               packet size in the IP header.  This then caused a TCP checksum failure
               and the packet was rejected.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low... fix defconfig files as necessary.
o USB (drivers/usbdev, drivers/usbhost)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: There is a workaround for a bug in drivers/usbdev/usbdev_storage.c.
               that involves delays.  This needs to be redesigned to eliminate these delays.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: drivers/usbhost/usbhost_rtl8187.c is a work in progress.  There is no RTL8187
               driver available yet.  That is a work in progress.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low (Unless you need RTL8187 support).

o Libraries (lib/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: The definition of environ in stdlib.h is bogus and will not
               work as it should.  This is because the underlying
               representation of the environment is not an arry of pointers.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: fgets implementation does not use C-buffered I/O, but rather
               talks to serial driver directly via read().  It includes VT-100
               specific editting commands.  This gets should be renamed readlin()
               and a more generic fgets() should be implemented.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low (unless you are using mixed C-buffered I/O with fgets and
               fgetc, for example).

  Description: Need some minimal termios support... at a minimum, enough to
               switch between raw and "normal" modes to support behavior like
               that needed for readline().
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: strftime() and other timing functions do not handle days of the week.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: There is an issue with the way that getopt() handles errors that
               return '?'.
               
               1. Does getopt() reset its global variables after returning '?' so
                  that it can be re-used?  That would be required to support where
                  the caller terminates parsing before reaching the last parameter.
               2. Or is the client expected to continue parsing after getopt()
                  returns '?'  and parse until the final parameter?
            
               The current getopt() implementation only supports #2.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: Not implemented: ferror() and clearerr()
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

o File system / Generic drivers (fs/, drivers/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  NOTE:  The NXFFS file system has its own TODO list at nuttx/fs/nxffs/README.txt

  Description: Implement chmod(), truncate().
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: FAT: long file names
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: The CAN driver is untested.  Add a test for the CAN driver.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: At present, the CAN driver does not support the poll() method.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: There is no way to remove a FIFO or PIPE created in the
               psuedo filesystem.  Once created, they persist indefinitely
               and cannot be unlinked.  This is actually a more generic
               issue:  unlink does not work for anything in the psuedo-
               filesystem.
  Status:      Open, but partially resolved: pipe buffer is at least freed
               when there are not open references to the pipe/FIFO.
  Priority:    Medium

  Description: The ROMFS file system does not verify checksums on either
               volume header on on the individual files.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low.  I have mixed feelings about if NuttX should pay a
               performance penalty for better data integrity.

  Description: The simple SPI based MMCS/SD driver in fs/mmcsd does not
               yet handle multiple block transfers.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium-Low

  Description: At present, mmap() only works with file descriptors associated
               with a ROMFS file system.  Generalize this logic so that if
               mmap is not supported by the file system or block driver, it
               will allocate memory and copy the file into RAM.  This would
               need some centralized logic so that the memory region would
               be shared on later mmap()'s on the same inode.  Reference counting
               would be required so that the multiply mmap()'ed region persists
               until the last munmap().
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: Block driver read-ahead buffer and write buffer support is
               implemented but not yet tested.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: The drivers/mmcsd/mmcsd_sdio.c driver has hooks in place to
               support read-ahead buffering and write buffering, but the logic
               is incomplete and untested.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: ENC28J60 driver is complete, but untested (I still haven't got
               a good ENC28J60 test platform).
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low

  Description: Time stamping is not implemented in the NuttX FA file system.
               See the following functions in fs/fat/fs_fat32util.c:

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: Need APIs to verify execution of P-Code from memory buffer.

  Descritpion: Logic in most setenv.sh files can create the following problem
               on many platforms:

                 basename: invalid option -- 'b'
                 Try `basename --help' for more information.

               The problem is that $0 is the current running shell which may include
               a dash in front:

                 $ echo $0
                 -bash

               But often is just /bin/bash (and the problem does not occur.  The fix

o Linux/Cywgin simulation (arch/sim)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: The simulated serial driver has some odd behavior.  It
               will stall for a long time on reads when the C stdio buffers are
               being refilled. This only effects the behavior of things like
               fgetc().  Workaround: Set CONFIG_STDIO_BUFFER_SIZE=0, suppressing
               all C buffered I/O.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low (because the simulator is only a test/development platform)

  Description: Simulator does not build correctly on 64-bit machines.  Two
               issues:
               1) It saves addresses in 32-bit types and these fail when cast
                  to pointers on a 64-bit host.
               2) up_setjmp.S does not build
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium and increasing (as 32-bit hosts gradually disappear).  NOTE
               is it possible to work-around this limitation by building the sim
               target for 32-bit operation on a 64-bit platform.  Modify the
               Make.defs file in the appropriate places so that -m32 is included
               in the CFLAGS and -m32 and -melf_386 are included in the LDFLAGS.
               See the patch 0001-Quick-hacks-to-build-sim-nsh-ostest-on-x86_64-as-32-.patch
               that can be found at http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/nuttx/files.

  Description: I never did get networking to work on the sim Linux target.  On Linux,
               it tries to use the tap device (/dev/net/tun) to emulate an Ethernet
               NIC, but I never got it correctly integrated with the NuttX networking.
               NOTE: On Cygwin, the build uses the Cygwin WPCAP library and is, at
               least, partially functional (it has never been rigorously tested).

  Priority:    Low (unless you want to test networking features on the simulation).
  
  Description: There is an X11-based framebuffer driver that you can use exercise
               the NuttX graphics subsystem on the simulator.  But I am not much
               of an X11 programmer so I did not use X11 autoconfiguration stuff.
               As a result, it builds on old X11 installations, but not on current
               versions.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low (unless you want to test graphics features on the simulation).

  Description: Since the simulation is not pre-emptible, you can't use round-robin
               scheduling (no time slicing).  Currently, the timer interrupts are
               "faked" during IDLE loop processing and, as a result, there is no
               task pre-emption because there are no asynchrous events.  This could
               probably be fixed if the "timer interrupt" were driver by Linux
               signals. NOTE:  You would also have to implement irqsave() and
               irqrestore() to block and (conditionally) unblock the signal.

  Descripion:  The NSH example has some odd behaviors.  Mult-tasking -- for example,
               execution of commands in background -- does not work normally.  This
               is due to the fact that NSH uses the system standard input for the
               console.  This means that the simulation is actually "frozen" all of
               the time when NSH is waiting for input and background commands never
               get the chance to run.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    This will not be fixed.  This is the normal behavior in the current
               design of the simulator.  "Real" platforms will behave correctly
               because NSH will "sleep" when it waits for console inpu and other
               tasks can run freely.

  Description: In the NSH example, the host HOST echoes each command so after you
               you enter a command, the command is repeated on the next line.  This
               is an artifact of the simulator only.

o ARM (arch/arm/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Description: ARM interrupt handling performance could be improved in some
               ways. One easy way is to use a pointer to the context save
               area in current_regs instead of using up_copystate so much.
               see handling of 'current_regs" in arch/arm/src/cortexm3/* for
               examples of how this might be done.

  Priority:    Low

  Description: The ARM and Cortex-M3 interrupt handlers restores all regisers
               upon return. This could be improved as well:  If there is no
               context switch, then the static registers need not be restored
               because they will not be modified by the called C code.

               of the context save and restore logic.

  Description: The ARM interrupt handling (arch/arm/src/arm/up_vectors.S) returns

               fine because everything is in kernel-mode.  In an operating model
               where applications run in user mode and interrupts/traps run in
               kernel-mode, I think that there is a problem with this.

                 first serial message.

               The general failure is as follows:

               - The target message pends in the endpoint packet memory
               - When the host-side of the test is stated, it correctly
                 reads this pending data.

  Description: When the interrupt-driven serial driver is used, the system

               With -reduceopt on the command line, I can get the printf output.
               However, there are still errors in the compiled code -- specifically
               in sched/timer_create.c.

               I have submitted a bug report to ZiLOG for this (support incident

  Description: The pascal add-on does not work with the z16f (that is

               SYSIO 0, WRITESTR a large case statement is executed.  This
               involves a call into the ZiLOG runtime library to __uwcase().
               __uwcase is passed a pointer to a structure containing jump
               information.  The cause of the failure appears to be that
               the referenced switch data is bad.

               If the customer does not want to modify uwcase.asm then the other
