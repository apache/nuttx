  Title:       CHILD PTHREAD TERMINATION
  Description: When a tasks exits, shouldn't all of its child pthreads also be
               terminated?
  Status:      Closed.  No, this behavior will not be implemented.
  Priority:    Medium, required for good emulation of process/pthread model.
               The current behavior allows for the main thread of a task to
               exit() and any child pthreads will persist.  That does raise
               some issues:  The main thread is treated much like just-another-
               pthread but must follow the semantics of a task or a process.
               That results in some inconsistencies (for example, with robust
               mutexes, what should happen if the main thread exits while
               holding a mutex?)

  Title:       pause() NON-COMPLIANCE
  Description: In the POSIX description of this function the pause() function
               must suspend the calling thread until delivery of a signal whose
               action is either to execute a signal-catching function or to
               terminate the process.  The current implementation only waits for
               any non-blocked signal to be received.  It should only wake up if
               the signal is delivered to a handler.
  Status:      Open.
  Priority:    Medium Low.

  Title:       ON-DEMAND PAGING INCOMPLETE
  Description: On-demand paging has recently been incorporated into the RTOS.
               The design of this feature is described here:
               http://www.nuttx.org/NuttXDemandPaging.html.
               As of this writing, the basic feature implementation is
               complete and much of the logic has been verified.  The test
               harness for the feature exists only for the NXP LPC3131 (see
               configs/ea3131/pgnsh and locked directories).  There are
               some limitations of this testing so I still cannot say that
               the feature is fully functional.
  Status:      Open.  This has been put on the shelf for some time.
  Priority:    Medium-Low

  Title:       GET_ENVIRON_PTR()
  Description: get_environ_ptr() (sched/sched_getenvironptr.c) is not implemented.
               The representation of the environment strings selected for
               NuttX is not compatible with the operation.  Some significant
               re-design would be required to implement this function and that
               effort is thought to be not worth the result.
  Status:      Open.  No change is planned.
  Priority:    Low -- There is no plan to implement this.

  Title:       TIMER_GETOVERRUN()
  Description: timer_getoverrun() (sched/timer_getoverrun.c) is not implemented.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low -- There is no plan to implement this.

  Title:       INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH execv() AND execl()
  Description: Simplified 'execl()' and 'execv()' functions are provided by
               NuttX.  NuttX does not support processes and hence the concept
               of overlaying a tasks process image with a new process image
               does not make any sense.  In NuttX, these functions are
               wrapper functions that:

               1. Call the non-standard binfmt function 'exec', and then
               2. exit(0).

               As a result, the current implementations of 'execl()' and
               'execv()' suffer from some incompatibilities, the most
               serious of these is that the exec'ed task will not have
               the same task ID as the vfork'ed function.  So the parent
               function cannot know the ID of the exec'ed task.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium Low for now

  Title:       ISSUES WITH atexit(), on_exit(), AND pthread_cleanup_pop()
  Description: These functions execute with the following bad properties:

               1. They run with interrupts disabled,
               2. They run in supervisor mode (if applicable), and
               3. They do not obey any setup of PIC or address
                  environments. Do they need to?
               4. In the case of task_delete() and pthread_cancel() without
                  defferred cancellation, these callbacks will run on the
                  thread of execution and address context of the caller of
                  task_delete() or pthread_cancel().  That is very bad!

               The fix for all of these issues it to have the callbacks
               run on the caller's thread as is currently done with
               signal handlers.  Signals are delivered differently in
               PROTECTED and KERNEL modes:  The delivery involves a
               signal handling trampoline function in the user address
               space and two signal handlers:  One to call the signal
               handler trampoline in user mode (SYS_signal_handler) and
               on in with the signal handler trampoline to return to
               supervisor mode (SYS_signal_handler_return)

               The primary difference is in the location of the signal
               handling trampoline:

               - In PROTECTED mode, there is on a single user space blob
                 with a header at the beginning of the block (at a well-
                 known location.  There is a pointer to the signal handler
                 trampoline function in that header.
               - In the KERNEL mode, a special process signal handler
                 trampoline is used at a well-known location in every
                 process address space (ARCH_DATA_RESERVE->ar_sigtramp).
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium Low.  This is an important change to some less
               important interfaces.  For the average user, these
               functions are just fine the way they are.

  Title:       execv() AND vfork()
  Description: There is a problem when vfork() calls execv() (or execl()) to
               start a new application:  When the parent thread calls vfork()
               it receives and gets the pid of the vforked task, and *not*
               the pid of the desired execv'ed application.

               The same tasking arrangement is used by the standard function
               posix_spawn().  However, posix_spawn uses the non-standard, internal
               NuttX interface task_reparent() to replace the child's parent task
               with the caller of posix_spawn().  That cannot be done with vfork()
               because we don't know what vfork() is going to do.

               Any solution to this is either very difficult or impossible without
               an MMU.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low (it might as well be low since it isn't going to be fixed).

  Title:       errno IS NOT SHARED AMONG THREADS
  Description: In NuttX, the errno value is unique for each thread.  But for
               bug-for-bug compatibility, the same errno should be shared by
               the task and each thread that it creates.  It is *very* easy
               to make this change:  Just move the pterrno field from
               struct tcb_s to struct task_group_s.   However, I am still not
               sure if this should be done or not.
               NOTE: glibc behaves this way unless __thread is defined then,
               in that case, it behaves like NuttX (using TLS to save the
               thread local errno).
  Status:      Closed.  The existing solution is better and compatible with
               thread-aware GLIBC (although its incompatibilities could show
               up in porting some code).  I will retain this issue for
               referencei only.
  Priority:    N/A

  Title:       SCALABILITY
  Description: Task control information is retained in simple lists.  This
               is completely appropriate for small embedded systems where
               the number of tasks, N, is relatively small.  Most list
               operations are O(N).  This could become an issue if N gets
               very large.

               In that case, these simple lists should be replaced with
               something more performant such as a balanced tree in the
               case of ordered lists.  Fortunately, most internal lists are
               hidden behind simple accessor functions and so the internal
               data structures can be changed if need with very little impact.

               Explicitly reference to the list structure are hidden behind
               the macro this_task().

  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low.  Things are just the way that we want them for the way
               that NuttX is used today.

  Title:       INTERNAL VERSIONS OF USER FUNCTIONS
  Description: The internal NuttX logic uses the same interfaces as does
               the application.  That sometime produces a problem because
               there is "overloaded" functionality in those user interfaces
               that are not desirable.

               For example, having cancellation points hidden inside of the
               OS can cause non-cancellation point interfaces to behave
               strangely.

               Here is another issue:  Internal OS functions should not set
               errno and should never have to look at the errno value to
               determine the cause of the failure.  The errno is provided
               for compatibility with POSIX application interface
               requirements and really doesn't need to be used within the
               OS.

               Both of these could be fixed if there were special internal
               versions these functions.  For example, there could be a an
               nxsem_wait() that does all of the same things as sem_wait()
               was does not create a cancellation point and does not set
               the errno value on failures.

               Everything inside the OS would use nx_sem_wait().
               Applications would call sem_wait() which would just be a
               wrapper around nx_sem_wait() that adds the cancellation point
               and that sets the errno value on failures.

               On particularly difficult issue is the use of common memory
               manager C, and NX libraries in the build.  For the FLAT
               build, that is not such a issue because the OS internal
               versions of the interfaces can be used.  But is a difficult
               problem for PROTECTED and KERNEL builds where the OS links
               with a different version of the libraries than does the
               application:  The OS version would use the OS internal
               interfaces and the application would use the standard
               interfaces.

               But that raises yet another issue:  If the application
               version of the libraries use the standard interfaces
               internally, then they may generate unexpected cancellation
               points.  For example, the memory management would take a
               semaphore using sem_wait() to get exclusive access to the
               heap.  That means that every call to malloc() and free()
               would be a cancellation point, a clear POSIX violation.

               Changes like that could clean up some of this internal
               craziness.

               UPDATE:
               2017-10-03:  This change has been completed for the case of
                 semaphores used in the OS.  Still need to checkout signals
                 and messages queues that are also used in the OS.  Also
                 backed out commit b4747286b19d3b15193b2a5e8a0fe48fa0a8638c.

               2017-10-10:  This change has been completed for the case of
                 message queue used in the OS.  I am keeping this issue
                 open because (1) there are some known remaining calls that
                 that will modify the errno (such as dup(), dup2(),
                 task_activate(), kthread_create(), exec(), mq_open(),
                 mq_close(), and others) and (2) there may still be calls that
                 create cancellation points.  Need to check things like open(),
                 close(), read(), write(), and possibly others.
               2018-01-30:  This change has been completed for the case of
                 scheduler functions used within the OS:  sched_getparam(),
                 sched_setparam(), sched_getscheduler(), sched_setschedule(),
                 and sched_setaffinity(),

  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low.  Things are working OK the way they are.  But the design
               could be improved and made a little more efficient with this
               change.

  Task:        IDLE THREAD TCB SETUP
  Description: There are issues with setting IDLE thread stacks:

               1. One problem is stack-related data in the IDLE threads TCB.
                  A solution might be to standardize the use of g_idle_topstack.
                  That you could add initialization like this in os_start:

                  @@ -344,6 +347,11 @@ void os_start(void)
                     g_idleargv[1]  = NULL;
                     g_idletcb.argv = g_idleargv;

                  +  /* Set the IDLE task stack size */
                  +

                     dq_addfirst((FAR dq_entry_t *)&g_idletcb, (FAR dq_queue_t *)&g_readytorun);

                  The g_idle_topstack variable is available for almost all architectures:

                  $ find . -name *.h | xargs grep g_idle_top
                  ./arm/src/common/up_internal.h:EXTERN const uint32_t g_idle_topstack;

                  ./x86/src/common/up_internal.h:extern uint32_t g_idle_topstack;

                  That omits these architectures: sh1, sim, xtensa, z16, z80,
                  ez80, and z8.  All would have to support this common
                  globlal variable.

                  Also, the stack itself may be 8-, 16-, or 32-bits wide,
                  depending upon the architecture and do have differing
                  alignment requirements.

               2. Another problem is colorizing that stack to use with
                 stack usage monitoring logic.  There is logic in some
                 start functions to do this in a function called go_os_start.
                 It is available in these architectures:

                 ./arm/src/efm32/efm32_start.c:static void go_os_start(void *pv, unsigned int nbytes)
                 ./arm/src/kinetis/kinetis_start.c:static void go_os_start(void *pv, unsigned int nbytes)

  Title:       PRIORITY INHERITANCE WITH SPORADIC SCHEDULER
  Description: The sporadic scheduler manages CPU utilization by a task by
               alternating between a high and a low priority.  In either
               state, it may have its priority boosted.  However, under
               some circumstances, it is impossible in the current design to
               switch to the correct priority if a semaphore held by the
               sporadic thread is participating in priority inheritance:

               There is an issue when switching from the high to the low
               priority state.  If the priority was NOT boosted above the
               higher priority, it still may still need to boosted with
               respect to the lower priority.  If the highest priority
               thread waiting on a semaphore held by the sporadic thread is
               higher in priority than the low priority but less than the
               higher priority, then new thread priority should be set to
               that middle priority, not to the lower priority.

               In order to do this we would need to know the highest
               priority from among all tasks waiting for the all semaphores
               held by the sporadic task.  That information could be
               retained by the priority inheritance logic for use by the
               sporadic scheduler.  The boost priority could be retained in
               a new field of the TCB (say, pend_priority).  That
               pend_priority could then be used when switching from the

  Title:       SIMPLIFY SPORADIC SCHEDULER DESIGN
  Description: I have been planning to re-implement sporadic scheduling for
               some time.  I believe that the current implementation is
               unnecessarily complex.  There is no clear statement for the
               requirements of sporadic scheduling that I could find, so I
               based the design on some behaviors of another OS that I saw
               published (QNX as I recall).

               But I think that the bottom line requirement for sporadic
               scheduling is that is it should make a best attempt to
               control a fixed percentage of CPU bandwidth for a task in
               during an interval only by modifying it is priority between
               a low and a high priority.  The current design involves
               several timers:  A "budget" timer plus a variable number of
               "replenishment" timers and a lot of nonsense to duplicate QNX
               behavior that I think I not necessary.

               It think that the sporadic scheduler could be re-implemented
               with only the single "budget" timer.  Instead of starting a
               new "replenishment" timer when the task is resumed, that
               single timer could just be extended.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low.  This is an enhancement.  And does anyone actually use
               the sporadic scheduler?

  Title:       REMOVE NESTED CANCELATION POINT SUPPORT
  Description: The current implementation support nested cancelation points.
               The TCB field cpcount keeps track of that nesting level.
               However, cancelation points should not be calling other
               cancellation points so this design could be simplified by
               removing all support for nested cancellation points.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low.  No harm is being done by the current implementation.
               This change is primarily for aesthetic reasons.  If would
               reduce memory usage by a very small but probably
               insignificant amount.

o SMP
  ^^^

  Title:       SMP AND DATA CACHES
  Description: When spinlocks, semaphores, etc. are used in an SMP system with
               a data cache, then there may be problems with cache coherency
               in some CPU architectures:  When one CPU modifies the shared
               object, the changes may not be visible to another CPU if it
               does not share the data cache. That would cause failure in
               the IPC logic.

               Flushing the D-cache on writes and invalidating before a read is
               not really an option.  That would essentially effect every memory
               access and there may be side-effects due to cache line sizes
               and alignment.

               For the same reason a separate, non-cacheable memory region is
               not an option.  Essentially all data would have to go in the
               non-cached region and you would have no benefit from the data
               cache.

               On ARM Cortex-A, each CPU has a separate data cache.  However,
               the MPCore's Snoop Controller Unit supports coherency among
               the different caches.  The SCU is enabled by the SCU control
               register and each CPU participates in the SMP coherency by
               setting the ACTLR_SMP bit in the auxiliary control register
               (ACTLR).

  Status:      Closed
  Priority:    High on platforms that may have the issue.

  Title:       MISUSE OF sched_lock() IN SMP MODE
  Description: The OS API sched_lock() disables pre-emption and locks a
               task in place.  In the single CPU case, it is also often
               used to enforce a simple critical section since not other
               task can run while pre-emption is locked.

               This, however, does not generalize to the SMP case.  In the
               SMP case, there are multiple tasks running on multiple CPUs.
               The basic behavior is still correct:  The task that has
               locked pre-emption will not be suspended.  However, there
               is no longer any protection for use as a critical section:
               tasks running on other CPUs may still execute that that
               unprotect code regsion.

               The solution is to replace the use of sched_lock() with
               stronger protection such as spin_lock_irqsave().
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium for SMP system.  Not critical to single CPU systems.
               NOTE:  There are no known bugs from this protential problem.

  Title:       CORTEX-A GIC SGI INTERRUPT MASKING
  Description: In the ARMv7-A GICv2 architecture, the inter-processor
               interrupts (SGIs) are non maskable and will occur even if
               interrupts are disabled.  This adde a lot of complexity
               to the ARMV7-A critical section design.

               Masayuki Ishakawa has suggested the use of the GICv2 ICCMPR
               register to control SGI interrupts.  This register (much like
               the ARMv7-M BASEPRI register) can be used to mask interrupts
               by interrupt priority.  Since SGIs may be assigned priorities
               the ICCMPR should be able to block execution of SGIs as well.

               Such an implementation would be very similar to the BASEPRI
               (vs PRIMASK) implementation for the ARMv7-M:  (1) The
               up_irq_save() and up_irq_restore() registers would have to
               set/restore the ICCMPR register, (2) register setup logic in
               arch/arm/src/armv7-a for task start-up and signal dispatch
               would have to set the ICCMPR correctly, and (3) the 'xcp'
               structure sould have to be extended to hold the ICCMPR
               register;  logic would have to added be save/restore the
               ICCMPR register in the 'xcp' structure on each interrupt and
               context switch.

               This would also be an essential part of a high priority,
               nested interrupt implementation (unrelated).
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low.  There are no know issues with the current non-maskable
               SGI implementation.  This change would, however, lead to
               simplification in the design and permit commonality with
               other, non-GIC imoplementations.

o Memory Management (mm/)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Title:       FREE MEMORY ON TASK EXIT
  Description: Add an option to free all memory allocated by a task when the
               task exits. This is probably not be worth the overhead for a
               deeply embedded system.

               There would be complexities with this implementation as well
               because often one task allocates memory and then passes the
               memory to another:  The task that "owns" the memory may not
               be the same as the task that allocated the memory.

               Update.  From the NuttX forum:
               ...there is a good reason why task A should never delete task B.
               That is because you will strand memory resources. Another feature
               lacking in most flat address space RTOSs is automatic memory
               clean-up when a task exits.

               That behavior just comes for free in a process-based OS like Linux:
               Each process has its own heap and when you tear down the process
               environment, you naturally destroy the heap too.

               But RTOSs have only a single, shared heap. I have spent some time
               thinking about how you could clean up memory required by a task
               when a task exits. It is not so simple. It is not as simple as
               just keeping memory allocated by a thread in a list then freeing
               the list of allocations when the task exists.

               It is not that simple because you don't know how the memory is
               being used. For example, if task A allocates memory that is used
               by task B, then when task A exits, you would not want to free that
               memory needed by task B. In a process-based system, you would
               have to explicitly map shared memory (with reference counting) in
               order to share memory. So the life of shared memory in that
               environment is easily managed.

               I have thought that the way that this could be solved in NuttX
               would be: (1) add links and reference counts to all memory allocated
               by a thread. This would increase the memory allocation overhead!
               (2) Keep the list head in the TCB, and (3) extend mmap() and munmap()
               to include the shared memory operations (which would only manage
               the reference counting and the life of the allocation).

               Then what about pthreads? Memory should not be freed until the last
               pthread in the group exists. That could be done with an additional
               reference count on the whole allocated memory list (just as streams
               and file descriptors are now shared and persist until the last
               pthread exits).

               I think that would work but to me is very unattractive and
               inconsistent with the NuttX "small footprint" objective. ...

               Other issues:
               - Memory free time would go up because you would have to remove
                 the memory from that list in free().
               - There are special cases inside the RTOS itself.  For example,
                 if task A creates task B, then initial memory allocations for
                 task B are created by task A.  Some special allocators would
                 be required to keep this memory on the correct list (or on
                 no list at all).

               Updated 2016-06-25:
               For processors with an MMU (Memory Management Unit), NuttX can be
               built in a kernel mode.  In that case, each process will have a
               local copy of its heap (filled with sbrk()) and when the process
               exits, its local heap will be destroyed and the underlying page
               memory is recovered.

               So in this case, NuttX work just link Linux or or *nix systems:
               All memory allocated by processes or threads in processes will
               be recovered when the process exits.

               But not for the flat memory build.  In that case, the issues
               above do apply.  There is no safe way to recover the memory in
               that case (and even if there were, the additional overhead would
               not be acceptable on most platforms).

               This does not prohibit anyone from creating a wrapper for malloc()
               and an atexit() callback that frees memory on task exit.  People
               are free and, in fact, encouraged, to do that.  However, since
               it is inherently unsafe, I would never incorporate anything
               like that into NuttX.

  Status:      Open.  No changes are planned.  NOTE: This applies to the FLAT
               and PROTECTED builds only.  There is no such leaking of memory
               in the KERNEL build mode.
  Priority:    Medium/Low, a good feature to prevent memory leaks but would
               have negative impact on memory usage and code size.

  Title:       STANDARD SIGNALS
  Description: 'Standard' signals and signal actions are not fully

  Title:       SIGEV_THREAD
  Description: Implementation of support for support for SIGEV_THREAD is available
               only in the FLAT build mode because it uses the OS work queues to
               perform the callback.  The alternative for the PROTECTED and KERNEL
               builds would be to create pthreads in the user space to perform the
               callbacks.  That is not a very attractive solution due to performance
               issues.  It would also require some additional logic to specify the
               TCB of the parent so that the pthread could be bound to the correct
               group.

               There is also some user-space logic in libc/aio/lio_listio.c.  That
               logic could use the user-space work queue for the callbacks.
  Status:      Low, there are alternative designs.  However, these features
               are required by the POSIX standard.
  Priority:    Low for now

  Title:       SIGNAL NUMBERING
  Description: In signal.h, the range of valid signals is listed as 0-31.  However,
               in many interfaces, 0 is not a valid signal number.  The valid
               signal number should be 1-32.  The signal set operations would need
               to map bits appropriately.

               sem_setproto()).

               "When a thread owns one or more mutexes initialized with the
               PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol, it shall execute at the higher of its

               at its priority in the event that its original priority is changed,

               a mutex that has been initialized with the PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT or
               PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol attributes, it shall not be subject to

  Status:      Open.  No changes planned.
  Priority:    Low -- about zero, probably not that useful. Priority inheritance is
               already supported and is a much better solution.  And it turns out
               that priority protection is just about as complex as priority inheritance.
               Excerpted from my post in a Linked-In discussion:

               "I started to implement this HLS/"PCP" semaphore in an RTOS that I
                work with (http://www.nuttx.org) and I discovered after doing the
                analysis and basic code framework that a complete solution for the
                case of a counting semaphore is still quite complex -- essentially
                as complex as is priority inheritance.

               "For example, suppose that a thread takes 3 different HLS semaphores
                A, B, and C. Suppose that they are prioritized in that order with
                A the lowest and C the highest. Suppose the thread takes 5 counts
                from A, 3 counts from B, and 2 counts from C. What priority should
                it run at? It would have to run at the priority of the highest
                priority semaphore C. This means that the RTOS must maintain
                internal information of the priority of every semaphore held by
                the thread.

               "Now suppose it releases one count on semaphore B. How does the
                RTOS know that it still holds 2 counts on B? With some complex
                internal data structure. The RTOS would have to maintain internal
                information about how many counts from each semaphore are held
                by each thread.

               "How does the RTOS know that it should not decrement the priority
                from the priority of C? Again, only with internal complexity. It
                would have to know the priority of every semaphore held by
                every thread.

               "Providing the HLS capability on a simple pthread mutex would not
                be such quite such a complex job if you allow only one mutex per
                thread. However, the more general case seems almost as complex
                as priority inheritance. I decided that the implementation does
                not have value to me. I only wanted it for its reduced
                complexity; in all other ways I believe that it is the inferior
                solution. So I discarded a few hours of programming. Not a
                big loss from the experience I gained."

  Title:       INAPPROPRIATE USE OF sched_lock() BY pthreads
  Description: In implementation of standard pthread functions, the non-
               standard, NuttX function sched_lock() is used.  This is very
               strong since it disables pre-emption for all threads in all
               task groups.  I believe it is only really necessary in most
               cases to lock threads in the task group with a new non-
               standard interface, say pthread_lock().

               This is because the OS resources used by a thread such as
               mutexes, condition variable, barriers, etc. are only
               meaningful from within the task group.  So, in order to
               performance exclusive operations on these resources, it is
               only necessary to block other threads executing within the
               task group.

               This is an easy change:  pthread_lock() and pthread_unlock()
               would simply operate on a semaphore retained in the task
               group structure.  I am, however, hesitant to make this change:
               In the FLAT build model, there is nothing that prevents people
               from accessing the inter-thread controls from threads in
               different task groups.  Making this change, while correct,
               might introduce subtle bugs in code by people who are not
               using NuttX correctly.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low.  This change would improve real-time performance of the
               OS but is not otherwise required.

  Title:       NSH PARTITIONING.
  Description: There are issues with several NSH commands in the NuttX kernel

               kernel and user code must trap into the protected kernel via

               that call  directly into kernel internal functions for which
               there is no syscall available.  The commands cause link failures
               in the kernel/protected build mode and must currently be disabled.

  Title:       apps/system PARTITIONING
  Description: Several of the USB device helper applications in apps/system
               violate OS/application partitioning and will fail on a kernel
               or protected build.  Many of these have been fixed by adding
               the BOARDIOC_USBDEV_CONTROL boardctl() command.  But there are
               still issues.

               These functions still call directly into operating system
               functions:

  Title:       C++ CONSTRUCTORS HAVE TOO MANY PRIVILEGES (PROTECTED MODE)
  Description: When a C++ ELF module is loaded, its C++ constructors are called
               via sched/task_starthook.c logic.  This logic runs in protected mode.
               The is a security hole because the user code runs with kernel-
               privileges when the constructor executes.

               Destructors likely have the opposite problem.  The probably try to
               execute some kernel logic in user mode?  Obviously this needs to
               be investigated further.

  Title:       TOO MANY SYSCALLS
  Description: There are a few syscalls that operate very often in user space.
               Since syscalls are (relatively) time consuming this could be
               a performance issue.  Here is some numbers that I collected
               in an application that was doing mostly printf output:

                 sem_post - 18% of syscalls
                 sem_wait - 18% of syscalls
                 getpid   - 59% of syscalls
                 --------------------------
                            95% of syscalls

               Obviously system performance could be improved greatly by simply
               optimizing these functions so that they do not need to system calls
               so frequently.  This getpid() call is part of the re-entrant
               semaphore logic used with printf() and other C buffered I/O.
               Something like TLS might be used to retain the thread's ID
               locally.

               Linux, for example, has functions call up() and down().  up()
               increments the semaphore count but does not call into the kernel
               unless incrementing the count unblocks a task; similarly, down
               decrements the count and does not call into the kernel unless
               the count becomes negative the caller must be blocked.

               Update:
               "I am thinking that there should be a "magic" global, user-
                accessible variable that holds the PID of the currently
                executing thread; basically the PID of the task at the head
                of the ready-to-run list. This variable would have to be reset
                each time the head of the ready-to-run list changes.

               "Then getpid() could be implemented in user space with no system call
                by simply reading this variable.

               "This one would be easy: Just a change to include/nuttx/userspace.h,
                configs/*/kernel/up_userspace.c, libc/, sched/sched_addreadytorun.c, and
                sched/sched_removereadytorun.c. That would eliminate 59% of the syscalls."

               Update:
               This is probably also just a symptom of the OS test that does mostly
               console output.  The requests for the pid() are part of the
               implementation of the I/O's re-entrant semaphore implementation and
               would not be an issue in the more general case.

               Update:
               One solution might be to used CONFIG_TLS, add the PID to struct
               tls_info_s.  Then the PID could be obtained without a system call.
               TLS is not very useful in the FLAT build, however.  TLS works by
               putting per-thread data at the bottom of an aligned stack.  The
               current stack pointer is the ANDed with the alignment mask to
               obtain the per-thread data address.

               There are problems with this in the FLAT and PROTECTED builds:
               First the maximum size of the stack is limited by the number
               of bits in the mask.  This means that you need to have a very
               high alignment to support tasks with large stacks.  But
               secondly, the higher the alignment of the stacks stacks, the
               more memory is lost to fragmentation.

               In the KERNEL build, the the stack lies at a virtual address
               and it is possible to have highly aligned stacks with no such
               penalties.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low-Medium.  Right now, I do not know if these syscalls are a
               real performance issue or not.  The above statistics were collected
               from a an atypical application (the OS test), and does an excessive
               amount of console output.  There is probably no issue with more typical
               embedded applications.

  Title:       SECURITY ISSUES
  Description: In the current designed, the kernel code calls into the user-space
               allocators to allocate user-space memory.  It is a security risk to
               call into user-space in kernel-mode because that could be exploited
               to gain control of the system.  That could be fixed by dropping to
               user mode before trapping into the memory allocators; the memory
               allocators would then need to trap in order to return (this is
               already done to return from signal handlers; that logic could be
               renamed more generally and just used for a generic return trap).

               Another place where the system calls into the user code in kernel
               mode is work_usrstart() to start the user work queue.  That is
               another security hole that should be plugged.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low (unless security becomes an issue).

  Title:       MICRO-KERNEL
  Description: The initial kernel build cut many interfaces at a very high level.
               The resulting monolithic kernel is then rather large.  It would
               not be a prohibitively large task to reorganize the interfaces so
               that NuttX is built as a micro-kernel, i.e., with only the core
               OS services within the kernel and with other OS facilities, such
               as the file system, message queues, etc., residing in user-space
               and to interfacing with those core OS facilities through traps.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low.  This is a good idea and certainly an architectural
               improvement.  However, there is no strong motivation now do
               do that partitioning work.

  Title:       USER MODE TASKS CAN MODIFY PRIVILEGED TASKS
  Description: Certain interfaces, such as sched_setparam(),
               sched_setscheduler(), etc. can be used by user mode tasks to
               modify the behavior of privileged kernel threads.
               For a truly secure system.  Privileges need to be checked in
               every interface that permits one thread to modify the
               properties of another thread.

               NOTE:  It would be a simple matter to simply disable user
               threads from modifying privileged threads.  However, you
               might also want to be able to modify privileged threads from
               user tasks with certain permissions.  Permissions is a much
               more complex issue.

               task_delete(), for example, is not permitted to kill a kernel
               thread.  But should not a privileged user task be able to do
               so?
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low for most embedded systems but would be a critical need if
               NuttX were used in a secure system.

o C++ Support
  ^^^^^^^^^^^

  Title:       USE OF SIZE_T IN NEW OPERATOR
  Description: The argument of the 'new' operators should take a type of
               size_t (see libxx/libxx_new.cxx and libxx/libxx_newa.cxx).  But
               size_t has an unknown underlying.  In the nuttx sys/types.h
               header file, size_t is typed as uint32_t (which is determined by
               architecture-specific logic).  But the C++ compiler may believe
               that size_t is of a different type resulting in compilation errors
               in the operator.  Using the underlying integer type Instead of
               size_t seems to resolve the compilation issues.
  Status:      Kind of open.  There is a workaround.  Setting CONFIG_CXX_NEWLONG=y
               will define the operators with argument of type unsigned long;
               Setting CONFIG_CXX_NEWLONG=n will define the operators with argument
               of type unsigned int.  But this is pretty ugly!  A better solution
               would be to get a hold of the compilers definition of size_t.
  Priority:    Low.

  Title:       STATIC CONSTRUCTORS AND MULTITASKING
  Description: The logic that calls static constructors operates on the main
               thread of the initial user application task.  Any static
               constructors that cache task/thread specific information such
               as C streams or file descriptors will not work in other tasks.
               See also UCLIBC++ AND STATIC CONSTRUCTORS below.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low and probably will not changed.  In these case, there will
               need to be an application specific solution.

  Title:       UCLIBC++ AND STATIC CONSTRUCTORS
               uClibc++ was designed to work in a Unix environment with
               processes and with separately linked executables. Each process
               has its own, separate uClibc++ state. uClibc++ would be
               instantiated like this in Linux:

               1) When the program is built, a tiny start-up function is
                  included at the beginning of the program. Each program has
                  its own, separate list of C++ constructors.

               2) When the program is loaded into memory, space is set aside
                  for uClibc's static objects and then this special start-up
                  routine is called. It initializes the C library, calls all
                  of the constructors, and calls atexit() so that the destructors
                  will be called when the process exits.

               In this way, you get a per-process uClibc++ state since there
               is per-process storage of uClibc++ global state and per-process
               initialization of uClibc++ state.

               Compare this to how NuttX (and most embedded RTOSs) would work:

               1) The entire FLASH image is built as one big blob. All of the
                  constructors are lumped together and all called together at
                  one time.

                  This, of course, does not have to be so. We could segregate
                  constructors by some criteria and we could use a task start
                  up routine to call constructors separately. We could even
                  use ELF executables that are separately linked and already
                  have their constructors separately called when the ELF
                  executable starts.

                  But this would not do you very much good in the case of
                  uClibc++ because:

               2) NuttX does not support processes, i.e., separate address
                  environments for each task. As a result, the scope of global
                  data is all tasks. Any change to the global state made by
                  one task can effect another task. There can only one
                  uClibc++ state and it will be shared by all tasks. uClibc++
                  apparently relies on global instances (at least for cin and
                  cout) there is no way to to have any unique state for any
                  "task group".

                  [NuttX does not support processes because in order to have
                  true processes, your hardware must support a memory management
                  unit (MMU) and I am not aware of any mainstream MCU that has
                  an MMU (or, at least an MMU that is capable enough to support
                  processes).]

                  NuttX does not have processes, but it does have "task groups".
                  See http://www.nuttx.org/doku.php?id=wiki:nxinternal:tasksnthreads.
                  A task group is the task plus all of the pthreads created by
                  the task via pthread_create().  Resources like FILE streams
                  are shared within a task group. Task groups are like a poor
                  man's process.

                  This means that if the uClibc++ static classes are initialized
                  by one member of a task group, then cin/cout should work
                  correctly with all threads that are members of task group. The
                  destructors would be called when the final member of the task
                  group exists (if registered via atexit()).

                  So if you use only pthreads, uClibc++ should work very much like
                  it does in Linux. If your NuttX usage model is like one process
                  with many threads then you have Linux compatibility.

               If you wanted to have uClibc++ work across task groups, then
               uClibc++ and NuttX would need some extensions. I am thinking
               along the lines of the following:

               1) There is a per-task group storage are within the RTOS (see
                  include/nuttx/sched.h). If we add some new, non-standard APIs
                  then uClibc++ could get access to per-task group storage (in
                  the spirit of pthread_getspecific() which gives you access to
                  per-thread storage).

               2) Then move all of uClibc++'s global state into per-task group
                  storage and add a uClibc++ initialization function that would:
                  a) allocate per-task group storage, b) call all of the static
                  constructors, and c) register with atexit() to perform clean-
                  up when the task group exits.

               That would be a fair amount of effort. I don't really know what
               the scope of such an effort would be. I suspect that it is not
               large but probably complex.

               NOTES:

               1) See STATIC CONSTRUCTORS AND MULTITASKING

               2) To my knowledge, only some uClibc++ ofstream logic is
                  sensitive to this.  All other statically initialized classes
                  seem to work OK across different task groups.

  Priority:    Low.  I have no plan to change this logic now unless there is
               some strong demand to do so.

               handled in the network layer, either (1) If CONFIG_UDP/TCP_WRITE_BUFFERS=y
               then we never have to wait to send; otherwise, we always have
               to wait to send.  So it is impossible to notify the caller
               when it can send without waiting.

               An exception "never having to wait" is the case where we are
               out of memory for use in write buffering.  In that case, the
               blocking send()/sendto() would have to wait for the memory
               to become available.
  Status:      Open, probably will not be fixed.
  Priority:    Medium... this does effect porting of applications that expect
               different behavior from poll()/select()

  Title:       INTERFACES TO LEAVE/JOIN IGMP MULTICAST GROUP
  Description: The interfaces used to leave/join IGMP multicast groups is non-standard.
               RFC3678 (IGMPv3) suggests ioctl() commands to do this (SIOCSIPMSFILTER) but
               also status that those APIs are historic.  NuttX implements these ioctl
               commands, but is non-standard because:  (1) It does not support IGMPv3, and
               (2) it looks up drivers by their device name (e.g., "eth0") vs IP address.

               Linux uses setsockopt() to control multicast group membership using the
               IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP and IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP options.  It also looks up drivers
               using IP addresses (It would require additional logic in NuttX to look up
               drivers by IP address).  See http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Multicast-HOWTO-6.html
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium.  All standards compatibility is important to NuttX.  However, most
               the mechanism for leaving and joining groups is hidden behind a wrapper
               function so that little of this incompatibilities need be exposed.

  Title:       CLOSED CONNECTIONS IN THE BACKLOG
               If a connection is backlogged but accept() is not called quickly, then
               that connection may time out.  How should this be handled?  Should the
               connection be removed from the backlog if it is times out or is closed?
               Or should it remain in the backlog with a status indication so that accept()
               can fail when it encounters the invalid connection?
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium.  Important on slow applications that will not accept
               connections promptly.

  Title:       IPv6 REQUIRES ADDRESS FILTER SUPPORT
  Description: IPv6 requires that the Ethernet driver support NuttX address
               filter interfaces.  Several Ethernet drivers do support there,
               however.  Others support the address filtering interfaces but
               have never been verifed:

               C5471, LM3S, ez80, DM0x90 NIC, PIC, LPC54: Do not support
                 address filtering.

  Title:       UDP MULTICAST RECEPTION
  Description: The logic in udp_input() expects either a single receive socket or
               none at all.  However, multiple sockets should be capable of
               receiving a UDP datagram (multicast reception).  This could be
               handled easily by something like:

                for (conn = NULL; conn = udp_active (pbuf, conn); )

               If the callback logic that receives a packet responds with an
               outgoing packet, then it will over-write the received buffer,
               however.  recvfrom() will not do that, however.  We would have
               to make that the rule: Recipients of a UDP packet must treat
               the packet as read-only.

  Title:       NETWORK WON'T STAY DOWN
  Description: If you enable the NSH network monitor (CONFIG_NSH_NETINIT_MONITOR)
               then the NSH 'ifdown' command is broken.  Doing 'nsh> ifconfig eth0'
               will, indeed, bring the network down.  However, the network monitor
               notices the change in the link status and will bring the network
               back up.  There needs to be some kind of interlock between
               cmd_ifdown() and the network monitor thread to prevent this.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low, this is just a nuisance in most cases.

  Title:       FIFO CLEAN-UP AFTER CLOSING UNIX DOMAIN DATAGRAM SOCKET
  Description: FIFOs are used as the IPC underlying all local Unix domain
               sockets.  In NuttX, FIFOs are implemented as device drivers
               (not as a special FIFO files).  The FIFO device driver is
               instantiated when the Unix domain socket communications begin
               and will automatically be released when (1) the driver is
               unlinked and (2) all open references to the driver have been
               closed.  But there is no mechanism in place now to unlink the
               FIFO when the Unix domain datagram socket is no longer used.
               The primary issue is timing.. the FIFO should persist until
               it is no longer needed.  Perhaps there should be a delayed
               call to unlink() (using a watchdog or the work queue).  If
               the driver is re-opened, the delayed unlink could be
               canceled?  Needs more thought.
               NOTE: This is not an issue for Unix domain streams sockets:
               The end-of-life of the FIFO is well determined when sockets
               are disconnected and support for that case is fully implemented.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low for now because I don't have a situation where this is a
               problem for me.  If you use the same Unix domain paths, then
               it is not a issue; in fact it is more efficient if the FIFO
               devices persist.  But this would be a serious problem if,
               for example, you create new Unix domain paths dynamically.
               In that case you would effectively have a memory leak and the
               number of FIFO instances grow.

  Title:       TCP IPv4-MAPPED IPv6 ADDRESSES
  Description: The UDP implementation in net/udp contains support for Hybrid
               dual-stack IPv6/IPv4 implementations that utilize a special
               class of addresses, the IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.  You can
               see that UDP implementation in:

  Title:       ETHERNET WITH MULTIPLE LPWORK THREADS
  Description: Recently, Ethernet drivers were modified to support multiple
               work queue structures.  The question was raised: "My only
               reservation would be, how would this interact in the case of
               having CONFIG_STM32_ETHMAC_LPWORK and CONFIG_SCHED_LPNTHREADS
               > 1? Can it be guaranteed that one work item won't be
               interrupted and execution switched to another? I think so but
               am not 100% confident."

               I suspect that you right.  There are probably vulnerabilities
               in the CONFIG_STM32_ETHMAC_LPWORK with CONFIG_SCHED_LPNTHREADS
               > 1 case.  But that really doesn't depend entirely upon the
               change to add more work queue structures.  Certainly with only
               work queue structure you would have concurrent Ethernet
               operations in that multiple LP threads; just because the work
               structure is available, does not mean that there is not dequeued
               work in progress.  The multiple structures probably widens the
               window for that concurrency, but does not create it.

               The current Ethernet designs depend upon a single work queue to
               serialize data.  In the case of muliple LP threads, some
               additional mechanism would have to be added to enforce that
               serialization.

               NOTE:  Most drivers will call net_lock() and net_unlock() around
               the critical portions of the driver work.  In that case, all work
               will be properly serialized.  This issue only applies to drivers
               that may perform operations that require protection outside of
               the net_lock'ed region.  Sometimes, this may require extending
               the netlock() to be beginning of the driver work function.

  Status:      Open
  Priority:    High if you happen to be using Ethernet in this configuration.

  Title:       REPARTITION DRIVER FUNCTIONALITY
  Description: Every network driver performs the first level of packet decoding.
               It examines the packet header and calls ipv4_input(), ipv6_input().
               icmp_input(), etc. as appropriate.  This is a maintenance problem
               because it means that any changes to the network input interfaces
               affects all drivers.

               A better, more maintainable solution would use a single net_input()
               function that would receive all incoming packets.  This function
               would then perform that common packet decoding logic that is
               currently implemented in every network driver.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low.  Really just as aesthetic maintainability issue.

  Title:       BROADCAST WITH MULTIPLE NETWORK INTERFACES
  Description: There is currently no mechanism to send a broadcast packet
               out through several network interfaces.   Currently packets
               can be sent to only one device.  Logic in netdev_findby_ipvXaddr()
               currently just selects the first device in the list of
               devices; only that device will receive broadcast packets.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    High if you require broadcast on multiple networks.  There is
               no simple solution known at this time, however.  Perhaps
               netdev_findby_ipvXaddr() should return a list of devices rather
               than a single device?  All upstream logic would then have to
               deal with a list of devices.  That would be a huge effect and
               certainly doesn't dount as a "simple solution".

  Title:       ICMPv6 FOR 6LoWPAN
  Description: The current ICMPv6 and neighbor-related logic only works with
               Ethernet MAC.  For 6LoWPAN, a new more conservative IPv6
               neigbor discovery is provided by RFC 6775.  This RFC needs to
               be supported in order to support ping6 on a 6LoWPAN network.
               If RFC 6775 were implemented, then arbitrary IPv6 addresses,
               including addresses from DHCPv6 could be used.

               UPDATE:  With IPv6 neighbor discovery, any IPv6 address may
               be associated with any short or extended address.  In fact,
               that is the whole purpose of the neighbor discover logic:  It
               plays the same role as ARP in IPv4; it ultimately just manages
               a neighbor table that, like the arp table, provides the
               mapping between IP addresses and node addresses.

               The NuttX, Contiki-based 6LoWPAN implementation circumvented
               the need for the neighbor discovery logic by using only MAC-
               based addressing, i.e., the lower two or eight bytes of the
               IP address are the node address.

               Most of the 6LoWPAN compression algorithms exploit this to
               compress the IPv6 address to nothing but a bit indicating
               that the IP address derives from the node address.  So I
               think IPv6 neighbor discover is useless in the current
               implementation.

               If we want to use IPv6 neighbor discovery, we could dispense
               with the all MAC based addressing.  But if we want to retain
               the more compact MAC-based addressing, then we don't need
               IPv6 neighbor discovery.

               So, the full neighbor discovery logic is not currently useful,
               but it would still be nice to have enough in place to support
               ping6.  Full neighbor support would probably be necessary if we
               wanted to route 6LoWPAN frames outside of the WPAN.

  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low for now.  I don't plan on implementing this.  It would
               only be relevant if we were to decide to abandon the use of
               MAC-based addressing in the 6LoWPAN implementation.

  Title:       ETHERNET LOCAL BROADCAST DOES NOT WORK

  Description: In case of "local broadcast" the system still send ARP
               request to the destination, but it shouldn't, it should
               broadcast.  For Example, the system has network with IP
               10.0.0.88, netmask of 255.255.255.0, it should send
               messages for 10.0.0.255 as broadcast, and not send ARP
               for 10.0.0.255

               For more easier networking, the next line should have give
               me the broadcast address of the network, but it doesn't:

  Title:       TCP ISSUES WITH QUICK CLOSE
  Description: This failure has been reported in the accept() logic:

               - psock_tcp_accept() waits on net_lockedwait() below
               - The accept operation completes, the socket is in the connected
                 state and psock_accept() is awakened.  It cannot run,
                 however, because its priority is low and so it is blocked
                 from execution.
               - In the mean time, the remote host sends a
                 packet which is presumably caught in the read-ahead buffer.
              - Then the remote host closes the socket.  Nothing happens on
                 the target side because net_start_monitor() has not yet been
                 called.
               - Then accept() finally runs, but not with a connected but
                 rather with a disconnected socket.  This fails when it
                 attempts to start the network monitor on the disconnected
                socket below.
               - It is also impossible to read the buffered TCP data from a
                 disconnected socket.  The TCP recvfrom() logic would also
                 need to permit reading buffered data from a disconnected
                 socket.

               This problem was report when the target hosted an FTP server
               and files were being accessed by FileZilla.

               connect() most likely has this same issue.

               A work-around might be to raise the priority of the thread
               that calls accept().  accept() might also need to check the
               tcpstateflags in the connection structure before returning
               in order to assure that the socket truly is connected.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Medium.  I have never heard of this problem being reported
               before, so I suspect it might not be so prevalent as one

  Title:       LOCAL DATAGRAM RECVFROM RETURNS WRONG SENDER ADDRESS
  Description: The recvfrom logic for local datagram sockets returns the

  Title:       USB STORAGE DRIVER DELAYS
  Description: There is a workaround for a bug in drivers/usbdev/usbdev_storage.c.
               that involves delays.  This needs to be redesigned to eliminate these
               delays.  See logic conditioned on CONFIG_USBMSC_RACEWAR.

               If queuing of stall requests is supported by the DCD then this workaround
               is not required.  In this case, (1) the stall is not sent until all
               write requests preceding the stall request are sent, (2) the stall is
               sent, and then after the stall is cleared, (3) all write requests
               queued after the stall are sent.

               See, for example, the queuing of pending stall requests in the SAM3/4
               UDP driver at arch/arm/src/sam34/sam_udp.c.  There the logic is do this
               is implemented with a normal request queue, a pending request queue, a
               stall flag and a stall pending flag:

               1) If the normal request queue is not empty when the STALL request is
                  received, the stall pending flag is set.
               2) If addition write requests are received while the stall pending flag
                  is set (or while waiting for the stall to be sent), those write requests
                  go into the pending queue.
               3) When the normal request queue empties successful and all of the write
                  transfers complete, the STALL is sent.  The stall pending flag is
                  cleared and the stall flag is set.  Now the endpoint is really stalled.
               4) After the STALL is cleared (via the Clear Feature SETUP), the pending
                  request queue is copied to the normal request queue, the stall flag is
                  cleared, and normal write request processing resumes.

  Title:       EP0 OUT CLASS DATA
  Description: There is no mechanism in place to handle EP0 OUT data transfers.
               There are two aspects to this problem, neither are easy to fix
               (only because of the number of drivers that would be impacted):

               1. The class drivers only send EP0 write requests and these are
                  only queued on EP0 IN by this drivers.  There is never a read
                  request queued on EP0 OUT.
               2. But EP0 OUT data could be buffered in a buffer in the driver
                  data structure.  However, there is no method currently
                  defined in the USB device interface to obtain the EP0 data.

               Updates:  (1) The USB device-to-class interface as been extended so
               that EP0 OUT data can accompany the SETUP request sent to the
               class drivers. (2) The logic in the STM32 F4 OTG FS device driver
               has been extended to provide this data.  Updates are still needed
               to other drivers.

               Here is an overview of the required changes:
               New two buffers in driver structure:

               1. The existing EP0 setup request buffer (ctrlreq, 8 bytes)
               2. A new EP0 data buffer to driver state structure (ep0data,
                  max packetsize)

               Add a new state:

               3. Waiting for EP0 setup OUT data (EP0STATE_SETUP_OUT)

               General logic flow:

               1. When an EP0 SETUP packet is received:
                  - Read the request into EP0 setup request buffer (ctrlreq,
                    8 bytes)
                  - If this is an OUT request with data length, set the EP0
                    state to EP0STATE_SETUP_OUT and wait to receive data on
                    EP0.
                  - Otherwise, the SETUP request may be processed now (or,
                    in the case of the F4 driver, at the conclusion of the
                    SETUP phase).
               2. When EP0 the EP0 OUT DATA packet is received:
                  - Verify state is EP0STATE_SETUP_OUT
                  - Read the request into the EP0 data buffer (ep0data, max
                    packet size)
                  - Now process the previously buffered SETUP request along
                    with the OUT data.
               3. When the setup packet is dispatched to the class driver,
                  the OUT data must be passed as the final parameter in the
                  call.

               Update 2013-9-2:  The new USB device-side driver for the SAMA5D3
               correctly supports OUT SETUP data following the same design as
               per above.

               Update 2013-11-7: David Sidrane has fixed with issue with the
               STM32 F1 USB device driver.  Still a few more to go before this
               can be closed out.

  Status:      Open
  Priority:    High for class drivers that need EP0 data.  For example, the
               CDC/ACM serial driver might need the line coding data (that
               data is not used currently, but it might be).

  Title:       IMPROVED USAGE of STM32 USB RESOURCES
  Description: The STM32 platforms use a non-standard, USB host peripheral
               that uses "channels" to implement data transfers the current
               logic associates each channel with an pipe/endpoint (with two
               channels for bi-directional control endpoints).  The OTGFS
               peripheral has 8 channels and the OTGHS peripheral has 12
               channels.

               This works okay until you add a hub and try connect multiple
               devices.  A typical device will require 3-4 pipes and, hence,
               4-5 channels.  This effectively prevents using a hub with the
               STM32 devices.  This also applies to the EFM32 which uses the
               same IP.

               It should  be possible to redesign the STM32 F4 OTGHS/OTGFS and
               EFM32 host driver so that channels are dynamically assigned to
               pipes as needed for individual transfers.  Then you could have
               more "apparent" pipes and make better use of channels.
               Although there are only 8 or 12 channels, transfers are not
               active all of the time on all channels so it ought to be
               possible to have an unlimited number of "pipes" but with no
               more than 8 or 12 active transfers.

  Title:       USB CDC/ACM HOST CLASS DRIVER
  Description: A CDC/ACM host class driver has been added.  This has been
               testing by running the USB CDC/ACM host on an Olimex
               LPC1766STK and using the configs/stm3210e-eval/usbserial
               configuration (using the CDC/ACM device side driver).  There
               are several unresolved issues that prevent the host driver
               from being usable:

              - The driver works fine when configured for reduced or bulk-
                only protocol on the Olimex LPC1766STK.

              - Testing has not been performed with the interrupt IN channel
                enabled (ie., I have not enabled FLOW control nor do I have
                a test case that used the interrupt IN channel).  I can see
                that the polling for interrupt IN data is occurring
                initially.

              - I test for incoming data by doing 'nsh> cat /dev/ttyACM0' on
                the Olimex LPC1766STK host.  The bulk data reception still
                works okay whether or not the interupt IN channel is enabled.
                If the interrupt IN channel is enabled, then polling of that
                channel appears to stop when the bulk in channel becomes
                active.

              - The RX reception logic uses the low priority work queue.
                However, that logic never returns and so blocks other use of
                the work queue thread.  This is probably okay but means that
                the RX reception logic probably should be moved to its own
                dedicated thread.

              - I get crashes when I run with the STM32 OTGHS host driver.
                Apparently the host driver is trashing memory on receipt
                of data.

                    L4 and F7.

              - The SAMA5D EHCI and the LPC31 EHCI drivers both take semaphores
                in the cancel method.  The current CDC/ACM class driver calls
                the cancel() method from an interrupt handler.  This will
                cause a crash.  Those EHCI drivers should be redesigned to
                permit cancellation from the interrupt level.

               Most of these problems are unique to the Olimex LPC1766STK
               DCD; some are probably design problems in the CDC/ACM host
               driver.  The bottom line is that the host CDC/ACM driver is
               still immature and you could experience issues in some
               configurations if you use it.

               That all being said, I know of know no issues with the current
               CDC/ACM driver on the Olimex LPC1766STK platform if the interrupt
               IN endpoint is not used, i.e., in "reduced" mode.  The only loss
               of functionality is output flow control.

               UPDATE: The CDC/ACM class driver may also now be functional on
               the STM32.  That needs to be verified.

                  that it can be re-used?  That would be required to support where
                  the caller terminates parsing before reaching the last parameter.
               2. Or is the client expected to continue parsing after getopt()
                  returns '?'  and parse until the final parameter?

  Title:       CONCURRENT STREAM READ/WRITE

               According to the fopen man page:

               "a+ Open for reading and appending (writing at end of file).
                The file is created if it does not exist. The initial file
                position for reading is at the beginning of the file, but
                output is always appended to the end of the file."

               At present, the single NuttX file pointer is positioned to the
               end of the file for both reading and writing.

  Title:       DIVIDE BY ZERO

               "lib_strtod.c does contain divisions by zero in lines 70 and 96.
                AFAIK, unlike for Java, division by zero is not a reliable way to
                get infinity in C. AFAIK compilers are allowed e.g. give a compile-
                time error, and some, such as sdcc, do. AFAIK, C implementations
                are not even required to support infinity. In C99 the macro isinf()
                could replace the first use of division by zero. Unfortunately, the
                macro INFINITY from math.h probably can't replace the second division
                by zero, since it will result in a compile-time diagnostic, if the

               I ported some code for converting quaternions to Euler
               angles to NuttX for my project and only got it working
               after switching to newlib math library.

               "NuttX does not fully implement IEC 60559 floating point
               from C99 (sections marked [MX] in OpenGroup specs) so if

               you might get surprises. I'd expect pow(0.0, 1.0) to

               under sched/pthread) that probably should be migrated in the
               C library where it belongs.

               I would really like to see a little flavor of a micro-kernel
               at the OS interface:  I would like to see more primitive OS

               One awkward thing is the incompatibility of KERNEL vs FLAT

  Title:       FORMATTING FIXED WIDTH INTEGERS
  Description: Formats like this: lib_vsprintf(_, "%6.6u", 0) do not work.
               There is no support for the precision/width option with
               integer types.  The format is simply is ignored and so can
               even cause crashes.

               For example:

               int hello_main(int argc, char *argv[])
               {
                 printf("Hello, World!!\n");
                 printf("%3.3u %3.3u %3.3u %3.3u %3.3u\n", 9, 99, 999, 9999, 99999);
                 return 0;
               }

               Generates this incorrect output:

               NuttShell (NSH) NuttX-7.20
               nsh> hello
               Hello, World!!
                 9  99 999 9999 99999
               nsh>

               That output, of course, should have been:

                 9  99 999 999 999

               The period and the precision value were being ignored (if
               floating point was disabled).  In that case, parsing of the
               variable arguments could get out of sync.  But a side
               effect of the referenced change is that precision value is
               now always parsed (but still incorrectly ignored for the
               case of integer formats).

               The fix would not be too difficult but would involve change
               several functions.  It would involve clipping the size of the
               number string.  For example:

               /* Get the width of the output */

               uwidth = getusize(FMT_CHAR, flags, n);
               if (trunc > 0 && uwidth > trunc)
                 {
                   uwidth = trunc;
                 }

               Then limiting the length of the output string to uwidth.
               This would probably mean passing an additional parameter to
               the many *toascii() functions like:

               /* Output the number */

               utoascii(obj, FMT_CHAR, flags, (unsigned int)n, uwidth);

  NOTE:  The NXFFS file system has its own TODO list at nuttx/fs/nxffs/README.txt

  Title:       MISSING FILE SYSTEM FEATURES
  Description: Implement missing file system features:

               chmod() is probably not relevant since file modes are not
                 currently supported.

                 File privileges would also be good to support.  But this is
                 really a small part of a much larger feature.  NuttX has no
                 user IDs, there are no groups, there are no privileges
                 associated with either.  User's don't need credentials.
                 This is really a system wide issues of which chmod is only
                 a small part.

                 User privileges never seemed important to me since NuttX is
                 intended for deeply embedded environments where there are
                 not multiple users with varying levels of trust.

               link, unlink, softlink, readlink - For symbolic links.  Only
                 the ROMFS file system currently supports hard and soft links,
                 so this is not too important.  The top-level, pseudo-file
                 system supports soft links.

               File locking

               Special files - NuttX support special files only in the top-
                 level pseudo file system.  Unix systems support many
                 different special files via mknod().  This would be
                 important only if it is an objective of NuttX to become a
                 true Unix OS.  Again only supported by ROMFS.

  Title:       UNIFIED DESCRIPTOR REPRESENTATION
  Description: There are two separate ranges of descriptors for file and
               socket descriptors: if a descriptor is in one range then it is
               recognized as a file descriptor; if it is in another range
               then it is recognized as a socket descriptor.  These separate
               descriptor ranges can cause problems, for example, they makes
               dup'ing descriptors with dup2() problematic.  The two groups
               of descriptors are really indices into two separate tables:
               On an array of file structures and the other an array of
               socket structures.  There really should be one array that
               is a union of file and socket descriptors.  Then socket and
               file descriptors could lie in the same range.

               Another example of how the current implementation limits
               functionality:  I recently started to implement of the FILEMAX
               (using pctl() instead sysctl()).  My objective was to be able
               to control the number of available file descriptors on a task-
               by-task basis.  The complexity due to the partitioning of
               descriptor space in a range for file descriptors and a range
               for socket descriptors made this feature nearly impossible to
               implement.

  Title:       MISSING FILES IN NSH 'LS' OF A DIRECTORY
  Description: I have seen cases where (1) long file names are enabled,
               but (2) a short file name is created like:

                 nsh> echo "This is another test" >/mnt/sdcard/another.txt

               But then on subsequent 'ls' operations, the file does not appear:

                 nsh> ls -l /mnt/sdcard

               I have determined that the problem is because, for some as-
               of-yet-unkown reason the short file name is treated as a long
               file name.  The name then fails the long filename checksum
               test and is skipped.

               readdir() (and fat_readdir()) is the logic underlying the
               failure and the problem appears to be something unique to the
               fat_readdir() implementation.  Why?  Because the file is
               visible when you put the SD card on a PC and because this
               works fine:

                 nsh> ls -l /mnt/sdcard/another.txt

               The failure does not happen on all short file names.  I do
               not understand the pattern.  But I have not had the opportunity
               to dig into this deeply.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Perhaps not a problem???  I have analyzed this problem and
               I am not sure what to do about it.  I am suspected that a
               fat filesystem was used with a version of NuttX that does
               not support long file name entries.  Here is the failure
               scenario:

               1) A file with a long file name is created under Windows.
               2) Then the file is deleted.  I am not sure if Windows or
                  NuttX deleted the file, but the resulting directory
                  content is not compatible with NuttX with long file
                  name support.

                  The file deletion left the full sequence of long
                  file name entries intact but apparently delete only
                  the following short file name entry.  I am thinking
                  that this might have happened because a version of NuttX
                  with only short file name support was used to delete
                  the file.

               3) When a new file with a short file name was created, it
                  re-used the short file name entry that was previously
                  deleted.  This makes the new short file name entry
                  look like a part of the long file name.

               4) When comparing the checksum in the long file name
                  entry with the checksum of the short file name, the
                  checksum fails and the entire directory sequence is
                  ignored by readdir() logic.  This is why the file does
                  not appear in the 'ls'.

  Title:       AUTO-RAISE DISABLED
  Description: Auto-raise is currently disabled in NX multi-server mode.  The

               - Most touchscreen controls send touch data a high rates
               - In multi-server mode, touch events get queued in a message
                  queue.
               - The logic that receives the messages performs the auto-raise.
                 But it can do stupid things after the first auto-raise as
                 it operates on the stale data in the message queue.
               I am thinking that auto-raise ought to be removed from NuttX
               and moved out into a graphics layer (like NxWM) that knows
               more about the appropriate context to do the autoraise.

  Title:       PER-WINDOW FRAMEBUFFERS

               in most cases.

               One solution would be to provide a per-window framebuffer.
               All rending would be performed into the per-window framebuffer
               and the rended bits would be copied the LCD or framebuffer
               device memory on demand when the redraw is required.

               This would (a) greatly simplify the graphics interface, (b)
               greatly improve redraw performance, and (c) enable a more
               generic use of the windowing.  The downside would be a large
               usage of memory to hold all of the framebuffers, one for each
               window.

  Title:       LOW-RES FRAMEBUFFER RENDERERING
  Description: There are obvious issues in the low-res, < 8 BPP, implemenation of
               the framebuffer rendering logic of graphics/nxglib/fb.  I see two
               obvious problems in reviewing nxglib_copyrectangle():

               1. The masking logic might work 1 BPP, but is insufficient for other
                  resolutions like 2-BPP and 4-BPP.
               2. The use of lnlen will not handle multiple bits per pixel.  It
                  would need to be converted to a byte count.

               The function PDC_copy_glyph() in the file apps/graphics/pdcurs34/nuttx/pdcdisp.c
               derives from nxglib_copyrectangle() and all of those issues have been
               resolved in that file.

               Other frambuffer rendering functions probably have similar issues.

  Title:       SIMULATOR HAS NO INTERRUPTS (NON-PREMPTIBLE)

               Currently, all timing and serial input is simulated in the IDLE loop:

               fakes timer and UART events.

               "faked" during IDLE loop processing and, as a result, there is no
               task pre-emption because there are no asynchronous events.  This could
               probably be fixed if the "timer interrupt" were driver by Linux
               signals. NOTE:  You would also have to implement up_irq_save() and

  Title:       SMP SIMULATION ISSUES
  Description: The configuration has basic support SMP testing.  The simulation
               supports the emulation of multiple CPUs by creating multiple
               pthreads, each run a copy of the simulation in the same process
               address space.

               At present, the SMP simulation is not fully functional:  It does
               operate on the simulated CPU threads for a few context switches
               then fails during a setjmp() operation.  I suspect that this is
               not an issue with the NuttX SMP logic but more likely some chaos
               in the pthread controls. I have seen similar such strange behavior
               other times that I have tried to use setjmp/longmp from a signal
               handler! Like when I tried to implement simulated interrupts
               using signals.

               Apparently, if longjmp is invoked from the context of a signal
               handler, the result is undefined:
               http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1318.htm

               You can enable SMP for ostest configuration by enabling:

                 -# CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL is not set
                 +CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL=y

                 +CONFIG_SPINLOCK=y
                 +CONFIG_SMP=y
                 +CONFIG_SMP_NCPUS=2
                 +CONFIG_SMP_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE=2048

               You also must enable near-realtime-performance otherwise even long
               timeouts will expire before a CPU thread even has a chance to
               execute.

                 -# CONFIG_SIM_WALLTIME is not set
                 +CONFIG_SIM_WALLTIME=y

               And you can enable some additional debug output with:

                 -# CONFIG_DEBUG_SCHED is not set
                 +CONFIG_DEBUG_SCHED=y

                 -# CONFIG_SCHED_INSTRUMENTATION is not set
                 +CONFIG_SCHED_INSTRUMENTATION=y

               The NSH configuration can also be forced to run SMP, but
               suffers from the same quirky behavior.  I can be made
               reliable if you modify arch/sim/src/up_idle.c so that
               the IDLE loop only runs for CPU0.  Otherwise, often
               simuart_post() will be called from CPU1 and it will try
               to restart NSH on CPU0 and, again, the same quirkiness
               occurs.

               But for example, this command:

                 nsh> sleep 1 &

               will execute the sleep command on CPU1 which has worked
               every time that I have tried it (which is not too many
               times).

               This approach is already implemented for the ARM Cortex-M0,
               Cortex-M3, Cortex-M4, and Cortex-A5 families.  But still needs
               to be back-ported to the ARM7 and ARM9 (which are nearly

                 /* Then return to the address at the stop of the stack,
                  * destroying the stack frame
                  */

                 ldr pc, [sp], #4

               Under conditions of excessively high interrupt conditions, many
               nested interrupts can occur just after the 'msr cpsr' instruction.
               At that time, there are 4 bytes on the stack and, with each
               interrupt, the stack pointer may increment and possibly overflow.

               This can happen only under conditions of continuous interrupts.
               One suggested change is:

                 ldr  r1, [r0, #(4*REG_CPSR)] /* Fetch the stored CPSR value */
                 msr spsr_cxsf, r1 /* Set the CPSR */
                 ldmia     r0, {r0-r15}^

               But this has not been proven to be a solution.

               UPDATE:  Other ARM architectures have a similar issue.

  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low.  The conditions of continuous interrupts is really the problem.
               If your design needs continuous interrupts like this, please try
               the above change and, please, submit a patch with the working fix.

  Title:       IMPROVED TASK START-UP AND SYSCALL RETURN
  Description: Couldn't up_start_task and up_start_pthread syscalls be
               eliminated.  Wouldn't this work to get us from kernel-
               to user-mode with a system trap:

                 lda r13, #address
                 str rn, [r13]
                 msr spsr_SVC, rm
                 ld r13,{r15}^

               Would also need to set r13_USER and r14_USER. For new
               SYS_context_switch... couldn't we do he same thing?

               Also... System calls use traps to get from user- to kernel-
               mode to perform OS services.  That is necessary to get from
               user- to kernel-mode.  But then another trap is used to get
               from kernel- back to user-mode.  It seems like this second
               trap should be unnecessary.  We should be able to do the
               same kind of logic to do this.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low-ish, but a good opportunity for performance improvement.

  Title:       USE COMMON VECTOR LOGIC IN ALL ARM ARCHITECTURES.
  Description: Originally, each ARMv7-M MCU architecture had its own
               private implementation for interrupt vectors and interrupt
               handling logic.  This was superceded by common interrupt
               vector logic but these private implementations were never
               removed from older MCU architectures.  This is turning into
               a maintenance issue because any improvements to the common
               vector handling must also be re-implemented for each of the
               older MCU architectures.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low.  A pain in the ass and an annoying implementation, but
               not really an issue otherwise.

  Title:       NETWORK MONITOR NOT GENERALLY AVAILABLE
  Description: The NSH network management logic has general applicability
               but is currently useful only because it is embedded in the NSH

  Title:       READLINE IMPLEMENTATION
  Description: readline implementation does not use C-buffered I/O, but rather
               talks to serial driver directly via read().  It includes VT-100
               specific editing commands.  A more generic readline() should be
               implemented using termios' tcsetattr() to put the serial driver
               into a "raw" mode.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low (unless you are using mixed C-buffered I/O with readline and
               fgetc, for example).

o Modbus (apps/modbus)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Title:       MODBUS NOT USABLE WITH USB SERIAL
  Description: Modbus can be used with USB serial, however, if the USB
               serial connection is lost, Modbus will hang in an infinite
               loop.

               This is a problem in the handling of select() and read()
               and could probably resolved by studying the Modbus error
               handling.

               A more USB-friendly solution would be to: (1) Re-connect and
               (2) re-open the serial drviers.  That is what is done is NSH.
               When the serial USB device is removed, this terminates the
               session and NSH will then try to re-open the USB device.  See
               the function nsh_waitusbready() in the file
               apps/nshlib/nsh_usbconsole.c. When the USB serial is
               reconnected the open() in the function will succeed and a new
               session will be started.
  Status:      Open
  Priority:    Low.  This is really an enhancement request:  Modbus was never
               designed to work with removable serial devices.

  Title:       EXAMPLES/NX FONT CACHING
  Description: The font caching logic in examples/nx is incomplete.  Fonts are
               added to the cache, but never removed.  When the cache is full
               it stops rendering.  This is not a problem for the examples/nx
               code because it uses so few fonts, but if the logic were
               leveraged for more general purposes, it would be a problem.

               Update: see examples/nxtext for some improved font cache handling.
               Update: The NXTERM font cache has been generalized and is now
               offered as the standard, common font cache for all applications.
               both the nx and nxtext examples should be modified to use this
               common font cache.  See interfaces defined in nxfonts.h.

               tiny artifact would not be surprising (the initial window
               should like at (0,0) and be of size (1,1)), but sometimes
               the artifact is larger.
