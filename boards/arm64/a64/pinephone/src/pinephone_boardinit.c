 * Name: a64_memory_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   All A64 architectures must provide the following entry point.  This
 *   entry point is called early in the initialization before memory has
 *   been configured.  This board-specific function is responsible for
 *   configuring any on-board memories.
 *
 *   Logic in a64_memory_initialize must be careful to avoid using any
 *   global variables because those will be uninitialized at the time this
 *   function is called.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
 *

 * Name: a64_board_initialize

 * Description:
 *   All A64 architectures must provide the following entry point.  This
 *   entry point is called in the initialization phase -- after
 *   a64_memory_initialize and after all memory has been configured and
 *   mapped but before any devices have been initialized.

 * Input Parameters:
 *   None

 * Name: board_late_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   If CONFIG_BOARD_LATE_INITIALIZE is selected, then an additional
 *   initialization call will be performed in the boot-up sequence to a
 *   function called board_late_initialize(). board_late_initialize() will be
 *   called immediately after up_intitialize() is called and just before the
 *   initial application is started.  This additional initialization phase
 *   may be used, for example, to initialize board-specific device drivers.
