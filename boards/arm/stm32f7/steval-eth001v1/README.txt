  This README discusses issues unique to NuttX configurations for the
  STMicro STEVAL-ETH001V1 servo drive evaluation board.
  The STEVAL-ETH001V1 board is based on the STM32F767ZI MCU (2Mbytes FLASH
  and 512Kbytes of SRAM).

  The boards features:

    - Three-phase motor driver inverter based on STDRIVE101 gate driver and
      STH270N8F7-2 power MOSFET
    - NETX90 network controller
    - Operating supply voltage up to 48 V with a max. overvoltage robustness
      of 60 V
    - Motor brake dissipative energy circuit
    - Digital actuation section for industrial loads
    - RS485 interface for digital encoder and host interface
