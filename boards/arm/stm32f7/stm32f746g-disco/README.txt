STATUS
======

  2015-07-19:  The basic NSH configuration is functional using a serial
    console on USART1 (Virtual COM, i.e. ttyACM0). Very few other drivers
    are in place yet.

  2015-07-20:  STM32 F7 Ethernet appears to be functional, but has had
    only light testing.

Development Environment
=======================

  The Development environments for the STM32F746G-DISCO board are identical
  to the environments for other STM32F boards.  For full details on the
  environment options and setup, see the README.txt file in the
  boards/arm/stm32f7/stm32f746g-disco directory.

LEDs and Buttons
================

  LEDs
  ----
  The STM32F746G-DISCO board has numerous LEDs but only one, LD1 located
  near the reset button, that can be controlled by software (LD2 is a power
  indicator, LD3-6 indicate USB status, LD7 is controlled by the ST-Link).

  LD1 is controlled by PI1 which is also the SPI2_SCK at the Arduino
  interface.  One end of LD1 is grounded so a high output on PI1 will
  illuminate the LED.

  This LED is not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is defined.
  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in include/board.h
  and src/stm32_leds.c. The LEDs are used to encode OS-related events as
  follows:

    SYMBOL              Meaning                 LD1
    ------------------- ----------------------- ------
    LED_STARTED         NuttX has been started  OFF
    LED_HEAPALLOCATE    Heap has been allocated OFF
    LED_IRQSENABLED     Interrupts enabled      OFF
    LED_STACKCREATED    Idle stack created      ON
    LED_INIRQ           In an interrupt         N/C
    LED_SIGNAL          In a signal handler     N/C
    LED_ASSERTION       An assertion failed     N/C
    LED_PANIC           The system has crashed  FLASH

  Thus is LD1 is statically on, NuttX has successfully  booted and is,
  apparently, running normally.  If LD1 is flashing at approximately
  2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system has halted.

  Buttons
  -------
  Pushbutton B1, labelled "User", is connected to GPIO PI11.  A high
  value will be sensed when the button is depressed.

Serial Console
==============

  The STM32F469G-DISCO uses USART1 connected to "Virtual COM", so when you
  plug it on your computer it will be detected as a USB port (i.e. ttyACM0):

  -------- ---------------
              STM32F7
  V.COM     FUNCTION  GPIO
  -----    --------- -----
  RXD      USART1_RX PB7
  TXD      USART1_TX PA9
  ------   --------- -----

  All you need to do after flashing NuttX on this board is use a serial
  console tool (minicom, picocom, screen, hyperterminal, teraterm, putty,
  etc ) configured to 115200 8n1.

Porting STM32 F4 Drivers
========================

  The STM32F746 is very similar to the STM32 F429 and many of the drivers
  in the stm32/ directory could be ported here:  ADC, BBSRAM, CAN, DAC,
  DMA2D, FLASH, I2C, IWDG, LSE, LSI, LTDC, OTGFS, OTGHS, PM, Quadrature
  Encoder, RNG, RTCC, SDMMC (was SDIO), Timer/counters, and WWDG.

  Many of these drivers would be ported very simply; many ports would just
  be a matter of copying files and some seach-and-replacement.  Like:

    1. Compare the two register definitions files; make sure that the STM32
       F4 peripheral is identical (or nearly identical) to the F7
       peripheral.  If so then,
    2. Copy the register definition file from the stm32/chip directory to
       the stm32f7/chip directory, making name changes as appropriate and
       updating the driver for any minor register differences.
    3. Copy the corresponding C  file (and possibly a matching .h file) from
       the stm32/ directory to the stm32f7/ directory again with naming
       changes and changes for any register differences.
    4. Update the Make.defs file to include the new C file in the build.

  For other files, particularly those that use DMA, the port will be
  significantly more complex.  That is because the STM32F7 has a D-Cache
  and, as a result, we need to exercise much more care to maintain cache
  coherency.  There is a Wiki page discussing the issues of porting
  drivers from the stm32/ to the stm32f7/ directories here:
  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NUTTX/Porting+Drivers+to+the+STM32+F7

FPU
===

FPU Configuration Options
-------------------------

There are two version of the FPU support built into the STM32 port.

1. Non-Lazy Floating Point Register Save

   In this configuration floating point register save and restore is
   implemented on interrupt entry and return, respectively.  In this
   case, you may use floating point operations for interrupt handling
   logic if necessary.  This FPU behavior logic is enabled by default
   with:

     CONFIG_ARCH_FPU=y

2. Lazy Floating Point Register Save.

   An alternative mplementation only saves and restores FPU registers only
   on context switches.  This means: (1) floating point registers are not
   stored on each context switch and, hence, possibly better interrupt
   performance.  But, (2) since floating point registers are not saved,
   you cannot use floating point operations within interrupt handlers.

   This logic can be enabled by simply adding the following to your .config
   file:

     CONFIG_ARCH_FPU=y
     CONFIG_ARMV7M_LAZYFPU=y

STM32F746G-DISCO-specific Configuration Options
===============================================

    CONFIG_ARCH - Identifies the arch/ subdirectory.  This should
       be set to:

       CONFIG_ARCH=arm

    CONFIG_ARCH_family - For use in C code:

       CONFIG_ARCH_ARM=y

    CONFIG_ARCH_architecture - For use in C code:

       CONFIG_ARCH_CORTEXM7=y

    CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP - Identifies the arch/*/chip subdirectory

       CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP=stm32f7

    CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP_name - For use in C code to identify the exact
       chip:

       CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP_STM32F746=y

    CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_STM32_CUSTOM_CLOCKCONFIG - Enables special STM32 clock
       configuration features.

       CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_STM32_CUSTOM_CLOCKCONFIG=n

    CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD - Identifies the boards/ subdirectory and,
       hence, the board that supports the particular chip or SoC.

       CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD=stm32f746g-disco (for the STM32F746G-DISCO development board)

    CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_name - For use in C code

       CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_STM32F746G_DISCO=y

    CONFIG_ARCH_LOOPSPERMSEC - Must be calibrated for correct operation
       of delay loops

    CONFIG_ENDIAN_BIG - should not be defined.

    CONFIG_RAM_SIZE - Describes the installed DRAM (SRAM in this case):

       CONFIG_RAM_SIZE=0x00010000 (64Kb)

    CONFIG_RAM_START - The start address of installed SRAM (SRAM1)

       CONFIG_RAM_START=0x20010000
       CONFIG_RAM_SIZE=245760

    This configurations use only SRAM1 for data storage.  The heap includes
    the remainder of SRAM1.  If CONFIG_MM_REGIONS=2, then SRAM2 will be
    included in the heap.

    DTCM SRAM is never included in the heap because it cannot be used for
    DMA.  A DTCM allocator is available, however, so that DTCM can be
    managed with dtcm_malloc(), dtcm_free(), etc.

    In order to use FMC SRAM, the following additional things need to be
    present in the NuttX configuration file:

    CONFIG_STM32F7_FMC_SRAM - Indicates that SRAM is available via the
      FMC (as opposed to an LCD or FLASH).

    CONFIG_HEAP2_BASE - The base address of the SRAM in the FMC address space (hex)

    CONFIG_HEAP2_SIZE - The size of the SRAM in the FMC address space (decimal)

    CONFIG_ARCH_FPU - The STM32F746G-DISCO supports a floating point unit (FPU)

       CONFIG_ARCH_FPU=y

    CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS - Use LEDs to show state. Unique to boards that
       have LEDs

    CONFIG_ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK - This architecture supports an interrupt
       stack. If defined, this symbol is the size of the interrupt
        stack in bytes.  If not defined, the user task stacks will be
      used during interrupt handling.

    CONFIG_ARCH_STACKDUMP - Do stack dumps after assertions

    CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS -  Use LEDs to show state. Unique to board architecture.

  Individual subsystems can be enabled:

  Timer devices may be used for different purposes.  One special purpose is
  to generate modulated outputs for such things as motor control.  If CONFIG_STM32F7_TIMn
  is defined (as above) then the following may also be defined to indicate that
  the timer is intended to be used for pulsed output modulation, ADC conversion,
  or DAC conversion. Note that ADC/DAC require two definition:  Not only do you have
  to assign the timer (n) for used by the ADC or DAC, but then you also have to
  configure which ADC or DAC (m) it is assigned to.

    CONFIG_STM32F7_TIMn_PWM   Reserve timer n for use by PWM, n=1,..,14
    CONFIG_STM32F7_TIMn_ADC   Reserve timer n for use by ADC, n=1,..,14
    CONFIG_STM32F7_TIMn_ADCm  Reserve timer n to trigger ADCm, n=1,..,14, m=1,..,3
    CONFIG_STM32F7_TIMn_DAC   Reserve timer n for use by DAC, n=1,..,14
    CONFIG_STM32F7_TIMn_DACm  Reserve timer n to trigger DACm, n=1,..,14, m=1,..,2

  For each timer that is enabled for PWM usage, we need the following additional
  configuration settings:

    CONFIG_STM32F7_TIMx_CHANNEL - Specifies the timer output channel {1,..,4}

  NOTE: The STM32 timers are each capable of generating different signals on
  each of the four channels with different duty cycles.  That capability is
  not supported by this driver:  Only one output channel per timer.

  STM32F746G-DISCO specific device driver settings

    CONFIG_U[S]ARTn_SERIAL_CONSOLE - selects the USARTn (n=1,2,3) or UART
           m (m=4,5) for the console and ttys0 (default is the USART1).
    CONFIG_U[S]ARTn_RXBUFSIZE - Characters are buffered as received.
       This specific the size of the receive buffer
    CONFIG_U[S]ARTn_TXBUFSIZE - Characters are buffered before
       being sent.  This specific the size of the transmit buffer
    CONFIG_U[S]ARTn_BAUD - The configure BAUD of the UART.  Must be

Configurations
==============

  Common Configuration Information
  --------------------------------
  Each STM32F746G-DISCO configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
  can be selected as follow:

    tools/configure.sh stm32f746g-disco:<subdir>

  Where <subdir> is one of the sub-directories listed below.

  NOTES:

    1. These configurations use the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
       change this configuration using that tool, you should:

       a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
          see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

       b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.

    2. By default, these configurations use the USART1 for the serial
       console.  Pins are configured to that RX/TX are available at
       pins D0 and D1 of the Arduion connectors.  This should be compatible
       with most RS-232 shields.

    3. All of these configurations are set up to build under Windows using the
       "GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors" that is maintained by ARM
       (unless stated otherwise in the description of the configuration).

         https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm

       As of this writing (2015-03-11), full support is difficult to find
       for the Cortex-M7, but is supported by at least this release of
       the ARM GNU tools:

         https://launchpadlibrarian.net/209776344/release.txt

       That toolchain selection can easily be reconfigured using
       'make menuconfig'.  Here are the relevant current settings:

       Build Setup:
         CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y               : Window environment
         CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y             : Cywin under Windows

       System Type -> Toolchain:
         CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y : GNU ARM EABI toolchain

       NOTE: As of this writing, there are issues with using this tool at
       the -Os level of optimization.  This has not been proven to be a
       compiler issue (as least not one that might not be fixed with a
       well placed volatile qualifier).  However, in any event, it is
       recommend that you use not more that -O2 optimization.

Configuration Directories
-------------------------

  nsh
  ---
    Configures the NuttShell (NSH) located at apps/examples/nsh.  The
    Configuration enables the serial interfaces on USART1.  Support for
    built-in applications is enabled, but in the base configuration no
    built-in applications are selected.

  netnsh
  ------
    This configuration is similar to the nsh but a lot more hardware
    peripherals are enabled, in particular Ethernet, as well as networking
    support.  It is similar to the stm32f769i-disco/netnsh
    configuration. This configuration uses USART1 for the serial console.
    USART1 is connected to the ST-link virtual com inside board.h to remove
    the need of a extra serial connection to use this board.

  lgvl
  ----
    STM32F746G-DISCO LittlevGL demo example.

    The LTDC is initialized during boot up.
    This configuration uses USART1 for the serial console.
    USART1 is connected to the ST-link virtual com inside board.h to remove
    the need of a extra serial connection to use this board.
    From the nsh command line execute the lvgldemo example:

      nsh> lvgldemo

    The test will execute the calibration process and then run the
    LittlevGL demo project.
