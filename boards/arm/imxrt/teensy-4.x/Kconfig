	---help---
		This configuration option ensures that if more that one CAN bus is set on
		that CAN 3 (with FD capability) will be initialized as can0.

config NET_USE_OTP_ETHERNET_MAC
	bool "Use Ethernet MAC address stored in OCOTP_MAC0 and OCOTP_MAC1"
	---help---
		The teensy 4.1 board has an "offical" unique MAC address stored in OCOTP (One-Time-Programmable) memory.
		When enabling this option, it is read and used when the ethernet peripheral is initialized.
		If so, the 'ifconfig  eth0' HWaddr should start with 04:e9:e5:...
		(the vendor ID of 'PJRC.COM, LLC') when this feature is enabled.
		It may also be used with other boards that have the OCOTP programmed with a valid MAC.
