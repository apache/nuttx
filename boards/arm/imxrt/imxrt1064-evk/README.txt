Serial Console
==============

  Virtual console port provided by OpenSDA:

           UART1_TXD   GPIO_AD_B0_12  LPUART1_TX
           UART1_RXD   GPIO_AD_B0_13  LPUART1_RX

  Arduino RS-232 Shield:

    J22 D0 UART_RX/D0  GPIO_AD_B1_07  LPUART3_RX
    J22 D1 UART_TX/D1  GPIO_AD_B1_06  LPUART3_TX

LEDs and buttons
================

  LEDs
  ----

  There are four LED status indicators located on the EVK Board.  The
  functions of these LEDs include:

    - Main Power Supply(D3)
      Green: DC 5V main supply is normal.
      Red:   J2 input voltage is over 5.6V.
      Off:   The board is not powered.
    - Reset RED LED(D21)
    - OpenSDA LED(D20)
    - USER LED(D18)

  Only a single LED, D18, is under software control.  It connects to
  GPIO_AD_B0_09 which is shared with JTAG_TDI and ENET_RST

  This LED is not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
  defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
  include/board.h and src/imxrt_autoleds.c. The LED is used to encode
  OS-related events as follows:

    ------------------- ----------------------- ------
    SYMBOL              Meaning                 LED
    ------------------- ----------------------- ------
    LED_STARTED         NuttX has been started  OFF
    LED_HEAPALLOCATE    Heap has been allocated OFF
    LED_IRQSENABLED     Interrupts enabled      OFF
    LED_STACKCREATED    Idle stack created      ON
    LED_INIRQ           In an interrupt         N/C
    LED_SIGNAL          In a signal handler     N/C
    LED_ASSERTION       An assertion failed     N/C
    LED_PANIC           The system has crashed  FLASH

  Thus if the LED is statically on, NuttX has successfully  booted and is,
  apparently, running normally.  If the LED is flashing at approximately
  2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system has halted.

  Buttons
  -------

  There are four user interface switches on the MIMXRT1050 EVK Board:

    - SW1: Power Switch (slide switch fir power from J2)
    - SW2: ON/OFF Button
    - SW3: Power-on Reset button state forces to reset the system power except
           SNVS domain
    - SW9: Reset button
    - SW8: User button GPIO5-00

  Only the user button is available to the software.  It is sensed on the
  WAKEUP pin which will be pulled low when the button is pressed.


J-Link External Debug Probe
===========================

  Install the J-Link Debug Host Tools and make sure they are in your search path.

  Attach a J-Link 20-pin connector to J21. Check that jumpers J47 and J48 are
  off (they are on by default when boards ship from the factory) to ensure SWD
  signals are disconnected from the OpenSDA microcontroller.

Configurations
==============

  Information Common to All Configurations
  ----------------------------------------
  Each i.MX RT 1064 configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
  can be selected as follow:

    tools/configure.sh [OPTIONS] imxrt1064-evk:<subdir>

  Where typical options are -l to configure to build on Linux or -c to
  configure for Cygwin under Linux.  'tools/configure.sh -h' will show
  you all of the options.

  Before building, make sure the PATH environment variable include the
  correct path to the directory than holds your toolchain binaries.

  And then build NuttX by simply typing the following.  At the conclusion of
  the make, the nuttx binary will reside in an ELF file called, simply, nuttx.

    make

  The <subdir> that is provided above as an argument to the tools/configure.sh
  must be is one of the following.

  NOTES:

  1. These configurations use the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
    change any of these configurations using that tool, you should:

    a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
       see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

    b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
       reconfiguration process.

  2. Unless stated otherwise, all configurations generate console
     output on UART3 (i.e., for the Arduino serial shield).

  3. All of these configurations are set up to build under Windows using the
     "GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors" that is maintained by ARM
     (unless stated otherwise in the description of the configuration).

       https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm

     That toolchain selection can easily be reconfigured using
     'make menuconfig'.  Here are the relevant current settings:

     Build Setup:
       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y               : Window environment
       CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y             : Cywin under Windows

     System Type -> Toolchain:
       CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y : GNU ARM EABI toolchain

Configuration sub-directories
-----------------------------

  can:

    This is an nsh configuration (see below) with added support of CAN driver.
    FlexCAN3 is chosen as default, the change can be made at System type peripheral
    selection. Please note that only FlexCAN3 and FlexCAN2 is available on this board.

    Bitrate and sample point can be also changed at System type peripheral selection,
    basic values are 1 MHz for bitrate and 0.80 for sample point. The FlexCAN driver
    for imxrt runs at 80 MHz clock frequency.

    The configuration also includes CAN utilities as candump and cansend.

  canfd:

    This is an nsh configuration (see below) with added support of CAN_FD driver.
    FlexCAN3 is chosen as default, please note that only FlexCAN3 is capable of
    providing CAN_FD support.

    Bitrate and sample point can be also changed at System type peripheral selection,
    basic values are 1 MHz for bitrate and 0.80 for sample point for arbitration phase
    and 4 MHz (bitrate) and 0.90 (sample point) for data phase. The FlexCAN driver
    for imxrt runs at 80 MHz clock frequency.

    The configuration also includes CAN utilities as candump and cansend.

  knsh:

    This is identical to the nsh configuration below except that NuttX
    is built as a protected mode, monolithic module and the user applications
    are built separately.  It is recommends to use a special make command;
    not just 'make' but make with the following two arguments:

        make pass1 pass2

    In the normal case (just 'make'), make will attempt to build both user-
    and kernel-mode blobs more or less interleaved.  This actual works!
    However, for me it is very confusing so I prefer the above make command:
    Make the user-space binaries first (pass1), then make the kernel-space
    binaries (pass2)

    NOTES:

    1. At the end of the build, there will be several files in the top-level
       NuttX build directory:

       PASS1:
         nuttx_user.elf    - The pass1 user-space ELF file
         nuttx_user.hex    - The pass1 Intel HEX format file (selected in defconfig)
         User.map          - Symbols in the user-space ELF file

       PASS2:
         nuttx             - The pass2 kernel-space ELF file
         nuttx.hex         - The pass2 Intel HEX file (selected in defconfig)
         System.map        - Symbols in the kernel-space ELF file

       The J-Link programmer will except files in .hex, .mot, .srec, and .bin
       formats.

    2. Combining .hex files.  If you plan to use the .hex files with your
       debugger or FLASH utility, then you may need to combine the two hex
       files into a single .hex file.  Here is how you can do that.

       a. The 'tail' of the nuttx.hex file should look something like this
          (with my comments added beginning with #):

            $ tail nuttx.hex
            #xx xxxx 00 data records
            ...
            :10 C93C 00 000000000040184000C2010000000000 90
            :10 C94C 00 2400080000801B4000C01B4000001C40 5D
            :10 C95C 00 00401C4000000C4050BF0060FF000100 74
            #xx xxxx 05 Start Linear Address Record
            :04 0000 05 6000 02C1 D4
            #xx xxxx 01 End Of File record
            :00 0000 01 FF

          Use an editor such as vi to remove the 05 and 01 records.

       b. The 'head' of the nuttx_user.hex file should look something like
          this (again with my comments added beginning with #):

            $ head nuttx_user.hex
            #xx xxxx 04 Extended Linear Address Record
            :02 0000 04 6020 7A
            #xx xxxx 00 data records
            :10 0000 00 8905206030002060F2622060FC622060 80
            :10 0010 00 0000242008002420080024205C012420 63
            :10 0020 00 140024203D0020603100206071052060 14
            ...

          Nothing needs to be done here.  The nuttx_user.hex file should
          be fine.

       c. Combine the edited nuttx.hex and un-edited nuttx_user.hex
          file to produce a single combined hex file:

          $ cat nuttx.hex nuttx_user.hex >combined.hex

       Then use the combined.hex file with the to write the FLASH image.
       If you do this a lot, you will probably want to invest a little time
       to develop a tool to automate these steps.

    STATUS:  This configuration was added on 8 June 2018 primarily to assure
    that all of the components are in place to support the PROTECTED mode
    build.  This configuration, however, has not been verified as of this
    writing.

  netnsh:

    This configuration is similar to the nsh configuration except that is
    has networking enabled, both IPv4 and IPv6.  This NSH configuration is
    focused on network-related testing.

    NOTES:

    1. LED support is disabled because there is a conflict between the LED
       GPIO and PHY pin usage.

    2. Telnet is enabled.  But since both IPv4 and IPv6 are enabled, it
       will default to IPv6.  That means that to connect a Telnet session
       from a PC, you will need to use the IPv6 address which by defaault
       is:

         telnet fc00::2

       Or, disable IPv4 support so that only IPv4 addressing is used.

    3. The network monitor is not enabled in this configuration.  As a
       result, the Ethernet cable must be connected when the board is
       powered up.  Otherwise, it will stall for a long period of time
       before the NSH prompt appears and you will not be able to used
       the board.

       The following configuration options should be added to your
       configuration in order to use the network monitor:

         CONFIG_IMXRT_ENET_PHYINIT=y
         CONFIG_IMXRT_GPIO1_0_15_IRQ=y
         CONFIG_IMXRT_GPIO_IRQ=y
         CONFIG_NETDEV_IOCTL=y
         CONFIG_NETDEV_PHY_IOCTL=y
         CONFIG_NSH_NETINIT_MONITOR=y
         CONFIG_NSH_NETINIT_RETRYMSEC=2000
         CONFIG_NSH_NETINIT_SIGNO=18
         CONFIG_NSH_NETINIT_THREAD=y
         CONFIG_NSH_NETINIT_THREAD_PRIORITY=80
         CONFIG_NSH_NETINIT_THREAD_STACKSIZE=1568

  nsh:

    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at examples/nsh.  This NSH
    configuration is focused on low level, command-line driver testing.
    Built-in applications are supported, but none are enabled.  This
    configuration does not support a network.

  lvgl:

    Configures the Littlev graphic library (lvgl) demo located under
    examples/lvgldemo. This configuration needs the optional LCD model
    RK043FN02H-CT from NXP. The LCD panel comes with the integrated
    capacitive touchscreen sensor FT5336GQQ connected to the LPI2C1 bus,
    address 0x38. NuttX support such touchscreen device via the driver
    ft5x06 (drivers/input/ft5x06.c). At the moment only the polling
    method is available, the board features an interrupt line connected
    to the touchscreen sensor IC.

    IMXRT1062 MCU provides the integrated LCD driver.

    The LCD panel features:
    - size 4.3"
    - resolution 480Ã272 RGB
    - backlight driver
    - dimensions [mm]: 105.5 (W) x 67.2(H) x 4.35(D) Max.

    To run the lvgl demo please type "lvgldemo" at nsh prompt:

    nsh> lvgldemo
