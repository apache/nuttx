/* There are four LED status indicators located on the EVK Board.  The
 * functions of these LEDs include:
 *
 *   - Main Power Supply(D3)
 *     Green: DC 5V main supply is normal.
 *     Red:   J2 input voltage is over 5.6V.
 *     Off:   The board is not powered.
 *   - Reset RED LED(D21)
 *   - OpenSDA LED(D20)
 *   - USER LED(D18)
 *
 * Only a single LED, D18, is under software control.
 *
 * This LED is not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
 * defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
 * include/board.h and src/imxrt_autoleds.c. The LED is used to encode
 * OS-related events as follows:
 *
 *   -------------------- ----------------------- ------
 *   SYMBOL               Meaning                 LED
 *   -------------------- ----------------------- ------
 *
 *   LED_STARTED       0  NuttX has been started  OFF
 *   LED_HEAPALLOCATE  0  Heap has been allocated OFF
 *   LED_IRQSENABLED   0  Interrupts enabled      OFF
 *   LED_STACKCREATED  1  Idle stack created      ON
 *   LED_INIRQ         2  In an interrupt         N/C
 *   LED_SIGNAL        2  In a signal handler     N/C
 *   LED_ASSERTION     2  An assertion failed     N/C
 *   LED_PANIC         3  The system has crashed  FLASH
 *   LED_IDLE             Not used
 *
 * Thus if the LED is statically on, NuttX has successfully  booted and is,
 * apparently, running normally.  If the LED is flashing at approximately
 * 2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system has halted.
