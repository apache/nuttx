/* The i.MXRT1060-EVK has 8MiB of Hyper FLASH beginning at address,
 * 0x0060:0000, Up to 512Kb of DTCM RAM beginning at 0x2000:0000, and 1MiB OCRAM
 * beginning at 0x2020:0000.  Neither DTCM or SDRAM are used in this
 * configuration.
 *
 * The user and kernel space partitions will be spanned with a single
 * region of size 2**n bytes.  As a consequence, as the partitions increase
 * in size, the alignment requirement also increases.  The sizes below give
 * the largest possible user address spaces (but leave far too much for the
 * OS).
 *
 * The solution to this wasted memory is to (1) use more than one region to
 * span the user spaces, or (2) poke holes in a larger region (via sub-
 * regions) to trim it to fit better.
 *
 * A detailed memory map for the 512KB SRAM region is as follows:
 *
 *   0x2020 0000:  Kernel .data region.  Typical size: 0.1KB
 *   ------ ----   Kernel .bss  region.  Typical size: 1.8KB
 *   0x2020 0800:  Kernel IDLE thread stack (approximate).  Size is
 *                 determined by CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE and
 *                 adjustments for alignment.  Typical is 1KB.
 *   ------ ----   Padded to 4KB
 *   0x2040 0000:  User .data region.  Size is variable.
 *   ------- ----  User .bss region  Size is variable.
 *   0x2042 0000:  Beginning of kernel heap.  Size determined by
 *                 CONFIG_MM_KERNEL_HEAPSIZE.
 *   ------ ----   Beginning of user heap.  Can vary with other settings.
 *   0x2080 0000:  End+1 of mappable OCRAM
