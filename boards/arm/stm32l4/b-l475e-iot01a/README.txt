STATUS
======

  o 2017-06-10:  I have no hardware in hand and I am not sure that I will
    even pursue this port.  This README is really no more than a thought
    experiment at the present time.

    A few days ago, I did add support for the STM32L4x5 MCU family to
    NuttX.  But no work has yet been done for this board port other
    than writing this README file.

  o 2017-06-13:  I just learned that development boards will not be
    available for another month.

  The board supports ARM mbed online compiler, but can also be programmed
  using IDEs such as IAR, Keil, and GCC-based IDEs.  STMicro also provides
  HAL libraries and code samples as part of the STM32Cube Package, as well
  as X-CUBE-AWS expansion software to connect to the Amazon Web Services
  (AWS) IoT platform.

  NOTES:

  1. The board usese Wi-Fi® module Inventek ISM43362-M3G-L44 (802.11 b/g/n
     compliant), which consists of BCM43362 and STM32F205 host processor
     that has a standard SPI or UART interface capability.  It means you
     will only use AT command to talk with Wi-Fi® module by SPI. All the
     tcp/ip stack is  built-in STM32F205 in Wi-Fi® module.

     This cannot integrate cleanly with the NuttX network stack.  A
     USERSOCK option was recently added that would permit implementation
     of the Inventek support in an applications.  But that would then
     preclude the 6LoWPAN integration into IPv6.

  2. The board uses Bluetooth® V4.1 module (SPBTLE-RF), which has built-in
     BLE stack.  Similar with wifi, you only use simple AT command to talk
     with this BLE module.

  3. STMicro provides contiki 6lowpan for mesh.
     http://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/osxcontiki6lp.html but mesh
     network is not popular in the market, star network is the mainstream
     for its simplicity and robustness.

LEDs and Buttons
================

  The black button B1 located on top side is the reset of the STM32L475VGT6.

  The blue button B1 located top side is available to be used as a digital
  input or as alternate function Wake-up.  When the button is depressed the logic state is "0", otherwise the logic state is "1".

  Two green LEDs (LD1 and LD2), located on the top side are available for the user. To light a LED a high logic state "1" should be written in the corresponding GPIO.

  Reference Color Name    Comment
    B2      blue  Wake-up Alternate function Wake-up
    LD1     green LED1    PA5 (alternate with ARD.D13)
    LD2     green LED2    PB14

  These LEDs are not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
  selected.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
  include/board.h and src/lpc31_leds.c. The LEDs are used to encode
  OS-related events as follows:

    SYMBOL                Meaning                     LED state
                                                    LED2     LED1
    -------------------  -----------------------  -------- --------
    LED_STARTED          NuttX has been started     OFF      OFF
    LED_HEAPALLOCATE     Heap has been allocated    OFF      OFF
    LED_IRQSENABLED      Interrupts enabled         OFF      OFF
    LED_STACKCREATED     Idle stack created         ON       OFF
    LED_INIRQ            In an interrupt            N/C      N/C
    LED_SIGNAL           In a signal handler        N/C      N/C
    LED_ASSERTION        An assertion failed        N/C      N/C
    LED_PANIC            The system has crashed     N/C      Blinking
    LED_IDLE             MCU is is sleep mode         Not used

  Thus if LED2 is statically on, NuttX has successfully booted and is,
  apparently, running normmally.  If LED1 is flashing at approximately
  2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system has halted.

  NOTE: That LED2 is not used after completion of booting and may
  be used by other board-specific logic.

  Of course, if CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is not selected, then both LEDs are
  available for use by other logic.

Configurations
==============

  Information Common to All Configurations
  ----------------------------------------
  Each  B-L475E-IOT01A configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
  can be selected as follow:

    tools/configure.sh [-l|c|n] /b-l475e-iot01a:<subdir>

  Where:
   -l selects the Linux (l) host environment.  The [-c|u|n] options
       select one of the Windows environments.  Default:  Use host setup
       in the defconfig file
   [-c|n] selects the Windows host and a Windows environment:
      Cygwin (c), or Windows native (n). Default Cygwin

  Before building, make sure that:

    1. The PATH environment variable include the correct path to the
       directory than holds your toolchain binaries.
    2. Check the .config file.  Make sure that the configuration is set for
       your build platform (e.g., Linux vs. Windows) and that the toolchain
       is set for the toolchain type you are using.

  The <subdir> that is provided above as an argument to the
  tools/configure.sh must be is one of those listed below.

  And then build NuttX by simply typing the following.  At the conclusion of
  the make, the nuttx binary will reside in an ELF file called, simply,
  nuttx.

    make

  NOTES:

  1. These configurations use the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
    change any of these configurations using that tool, you should:

    a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
       see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

    b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
       reconfiguration process.

  2. Unless stated otherwise, all configurations generate console
     output on USART1 (i.e., for ST-Link Virtual COM port).  The
     relevant configuration settings are listed below:

       CONFIG_STM32_USART1=y
       CONFIG_STM32_USART1_SERIALDRIVER=y
       CONFIG_STM32_USART=y

       CONFIG_USART1_SERIALDRIVER=y
       CONFIG_USART1_SERIAL_CONSOLE=y

       CONFIG_USART1_RXBUFSIZE=256
       CONFIG_USART1_TXBUFSIZE=256
       CONFIG_USART1_BAUD=115200
       CONFIG_USART1_BITS=8
       CONFIG_USART1_PARITY=0
       CONFIG_USART1_2STOP=0

  3. All of these configurations are set up to build under Windows using the
     "GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors" that is maintained by ARM
     (unless stated otherwise in the description of the configuration).

       https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm

     That toolchain selection can easily be reconfigured using
     'make menuconfig'.  Here are the relevant current settings:

     Build Setup:
       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y               : Window environment
       CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y             : Cywin under Windows

     System Type -> Toolchain:
       CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y : GNU ARM EABI toolchain

Configuration sub-directories
-----------------------------

  nsh:

    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at examples/nsh.  This
    configuration is focused on low level, command-line driver testing.

  spirit-6lowpan

    This is another version of nsh that is similar to the above 'nsh'
    configuration but is focused on testing the Spirit1 integration with
    the 6LoWPAN network stack.  It supports point-to-point, 6LoWPAN
    communications between two b-l47e-iot01a boards.  Additional differences
    from the 'nsh" configuration are summarized below:

    NOTES:

    1. You must must have two b-l475e-iot01a boards.

    2. IPv6 networking is enabled with TCP/IP, UDP, 6LoWPAN, and NSH
       Telnet support.

    3. Configuration instructions:  NSH does not configuration or
       bring up the network.  Currently that must be done manually.
       The configurations steps are:

         a) Assign a unique 8-bit node address to the Spirit1 board in the
            WPAN:

            nsh> ifconfig wpan0 hw 37

            Where 37 the address is an example.  It should be different for
            each radio, but in the the range 1..ed and ef..fe (ee and ff are
            the reserved for multicast and broadcast addresses, respectively.
            Zero is a valid address but not recommended).

         b) Bring each the network up on each board in the WPAN:

            nsh> ifup wpan0

            You can entry nsh> ifconfig to see if the node address and
            derived IPv4 are set correctly (the IPv6 address will not be
            determined until the network is UP).

    4. examples/udp is enabled.  This will allow two Spirit1 nodes to
       exchange UDP packets.  Basic instructions:

       On the server node:

         nsh> ifconfig
         nsh> udpserver &

       The ifconfig command will show the IP address of the server.  Then on
       the client node use this IP address to start the client:

         nsh> udpclient <server-ip> &

       Where <server-ip> is the IP address of the server that you got above.
       NOTE: There is no way to stop the UDP test once it has been started
       other than by resetting the board.

    5. examples/nettest is enabled.  This will allow two Spirit1 nodes to
       exchange TCP packets.  Basic instructions:

       On the server node:

         nsh> ifconfig
         nsh> tcpserver &

       The ifconfig command will show the IP address of the server.  Then on
       the client node use this IP address to start the client:

         nsh> tcpclient <server-ip> &

       Where <server-ip> is the IP address of the server that you got above.
       NOTE:  Unlike the UDP test, there the TCP test will terminate
       automatically when the packet exchange is complete.

    6. The NSH Telnet daemon (server) is enabled.  However, it cannot be
       started automatically.  Rather, it must be started AFTER the network
       has been brought up using the NSH 'telnetd' command.  You would want
       to start the Telent daemon only if you want the node to serve Telent
       connections to an NSH shell on the node.

         nsh> ifconfig
         nsh> telnetd

       Note the 'ifconfig' is executed to get the IP address of the node.
       This address derives from the 8-bit node address that was assigned
       when the node was configured.

    7. This configuration also includes the Telnet client program.  This
       will allow you to execute a NSH one a node from the command line on
       a different node. Like:

         nsh> telnet <server-ip>

       Where <server-ip> is the IP address of the server that you got for
       the ifconfig comma on the remote node.  Once the telnet session
       has been started, you can end the session with:

         nsh> exit

    STATUS:

       2017-08-01:  Testing began.  The Spirit1 no configurations with no
         errors, but there are no tests yet in place to exercise it.

       2017-08-02:  The nettest, udp, telnet test programs were added.

       2017-08-03:  Successfully exchanging packets, but there there are
         issues with address filtering, CRC calculation, and data integrity
         (like bad UDP checksums).  Lot's more to be done!

       2017-08-04:  Fixed some of the address filtering issues:  In Basic
         packets, need to force the Spirit to send the destination address.
         This fixes address filtering.  But...

         Converted to STack vs Basic packets.  We need to do this because
         the Basic packets do not provide the source node address.  Now
         correctly gets the source node address and uncompresses the source
         IP address.

         In addition, to avoid packet loss due to data overrun, I enabled
         the AutoAck, TX retries, the RX timeout options.

         With these changes (along with other, significant bugfixes), both
         the UDP test is now fully functional.  CRC filtering still must be
         disabled.

       2017-08-05:  Add the Telnet client problem.  Verified HC06 tests with
         no debug output; verified Telnet seessions between two spirit nodes.

         At this point everything seems functional, but somewhat reliable.
         Sometimes things seem to initialize in a bad state.

        2017-08-06:  Reducing the FIFO to 94 bytes fixed the problem with the
          2 byte CRC.

     Test Matrix:
       The following configurations have been tested successfully (with
       CRC disabled):

                     TEST  DATE
         COMPRESSION UDP   TCP   Telnet
         ----------- ----- ----- ------
         hc06        08/04 08/04 08/05   (CRC disabled)
         hc1         ---   ---   ---
         ipv6        ---   ---   ---
         ----------- ----- ----- ------

         Other configuration options have not been specifically addressed
         (such non-compressable ports, non-MAC based IPv6 addresses, etc.)

  spirit-starhub and spirit-starpoint

    These two configurations implement hub and and star endpoint in a
    star topology.  Both configurations derive from the spirit-6lowpan
    configuration and most of the notes there apply here as well.

    1. You must must have three b-l475e-iot01a boards in order to run
       these tests:  One that serves as the star hub and at least two
       star endpoints.

    2. The star point configuration differs from the primarily in the
       spirit-6lowpan in following is also set:

         CONFIG_NET_STAR=y
         CONFIG_NET_STARPOINT=y

       The CONFIG_NET_STARPOINT selection informs the endpoint that it
       must send all frames to the hub of the star, rather than directly
       to the recipient.

       The star hub configuration, on the other hand, differs from the
       spirit-6lowpan in these fundamental ways:

         CONFIG_NET_STAR=y
         CONFIG_NET_STARHUB=y
         CONFIG_NET_IPFORWARD=y

       The CONFIG_NET_IPFORWARD selection informs the hub that if it
       receives any packets that are not destined for the hub, it should
       forward those packets appropriately.

    3. TCP and UDP Tests:  The same TCP and UDP tests as described for
       the spirit-6lowpan coniguration are supported on the star
       endpoints, but NOT on the star hub.  Therefore, all network testing
       is between endpoints with the hub acting, well, only like a hub.

       Each node in the configuration must be manually initialized.
       Ideally, this would be automatically initialized with software logic
       and configuration data in non-volatilbe memory.  The the procedure
       is manual in this example.  These are the basic initialization
       steps with E1 and E2 representing the two star endpoints and C
       representing the star hub:

         C:  nsh> ifup wpan0           <-- Brings up the network on the hub
         C:  nsh> telnetd              <-- Starts the Telnet daemon on the hub
         C:  nsh> ifconfig             <-- To get the IP address of the hub

         E1: nsh> ifconfig wpan0 hw 37 <-- Sets E1 endpoint node address
         E1: nsh> ifup wpan0           <-- Brings up the network on the E1 node
         E1: nsh> telnetd              <-- Starts the Telnet daemon on the E1 node
         E1: nsh> ifconfig             <-- To get the IP address of E1 endpoint

         E2: nsh> ifconfig wpan0 hw 38 <-- Sets E2 endpoint node address
         E2: nsh> ifup wpan0           <-- Brings up the network on the E2 node
         E2: nsh> telnetd              <-- Starts the Telnet daemon on the E2 node
         E2: nsh> ifconfig             <-- To get the IP address of E2 endpoint

       It is not necessary to set the hub node address, that will automatically
       be set to CONFIG_SPIRIT_HUBNODE when the hub boots.  CONFIG_SPIRIT_HUBNODE
       is the "well-known" address of the star hub.

       The modified usage of the TCP test is then show below:

         E1: nsh> tcpserver &
         E2: nsh> tcpclient <server-ip> &

       Where <server-ip> is the IP address of the E1 endpoint.

       Similarly for the UDP test:

         E1: nsh> udpserver &
         E2: nsh> udpclient <server-ip> &

       Telenet sessions may be initiated from the any node to any other node:

         XX: nsh> telnet <server-ip>   <-- Runs the Telnet client on any node XX

       Where <server-ip> is the IP address of either the E1 or E2 endpoints
       or of the star hub.

    4. Hub UDP Test.  The hub of the star does not support the same level of
       test as for the endpoint-to-endpoint tests described above.  The primary
       role of the hub is packet forwarding.  The hub does support to test
       applications, however:  (1) A Telnet client that will permit the hub to
       establish remote NSH sesstions with any endpoint, and (2) A special
       version of the udpclient program to support testing of Spirit broadcast.

       IPv6 does not support "broadcast" in the same since as IPv4.  IPv6
       supports only multicast.  The special multicast address, ff02::1 is
       the "all-nodes address" and is functionally equivalent to broadcast.

       The spirit radios do support both multicast and broadcast with the
       special addresses 0xee and 0xff, respectively.  So the Spirit driver
       will map the all-nodes IPv6 to the Spirit destination address 0xff and
       the packet will be broadcast to all Spirit nodes.

       Here are the procedures for using the test

         C:  nsh> ifup wpan0           <-- Brings up the network on the hub

         E1: nsh> ifconfig wpan0 hw 37 <-- Sets E1 endpoint node address
         E1: nsh> ifup wpan0           <-- Brings up the network on the E1 node
         E1: udpserver &               <-- Start the UDP server

         E2: nsh> ifconfig wpan0 hw 38 <-- Sets E2 endpoint node address
         E2: nsh> ifup wpan0           <-- Brings up the network on the E2 node
         E2: udpserver &               <-- Start the UDP server

         C:  udpclient &               <-- Starts the UDP client side of the test

       The client will broadcast the UDP packets and, as each UDP packet is
       sent, it will be received by BOTH endpoints.

    STATUS:
      2017-08-05:  Configurations added.  Early testing suggests that there is
        a problem when packets are received from multiple sources at high rates:
        New incoming packets appear to cause RX FIFO errors and the driver does
        not recover well.

      2017-08-06:  The RX FIFO errors are worse when debug is enabled.  This led
        me to believe that the cause of the RX FIFO errors was due to too many
        interactions by the LP and HP work queue.  I restructured the tasking to
        reduce the amount of interlocking, but this did not eliminate the RX FIFO
        errors.

        Hmmm.. this statement appears in the STMicro driver:  "Sometimes Spirit1
        seems to NOT deliver (correctly) the 'IRQ_RX_DATA_READY' event for
        packets which have a length which is close to a multiple of RX FIFO size.
        Furthermore, in these cases also the content delivery seems to be
        compromised as well as the generation of RX/TX FIFO errors.  This can be
        avoided by reducing the maximum packet length to a value which is lower
        than the RX FIFO size."

        I tried implementing the RX FIFO almost full water mark thinking this
        might be a work around... it is not.  Still RX FIFO errors.  From my
        reading, the only known work-around is to reduce the maximum packet
        size so that it is smaller than 96.  I tried setting the maximum packet
        length to 84 and that did NOT eliminate the RX FIFO error.

        At the end of the TCP test, the "nsh> ifconfig" command shows that
        there were two TX timeouts.  Perhaps this is related?  I found that
        the TX timeout was not being cancelled.  It must be canceled on each
        TX completed or TX error.  This DID eliminate the RX FIFO error, but
        now the test hangs and does not complete.

        Another Errata:  "Using the STack packet format and no CRC field, the
        reading from RX FIFO to the last received byte, is not possible. ..."
        Workaround: "By configuring the packet handler with at least one byte
        of CRC, the problem is solved. If the CRC is not required in the
        application, configure one byte of CRC in the receiver only, to read
        the payload correctly from RX FIFO."

        Reducing the FIFO to 94 bytes fixed the problem with the 2 byte CRC
        but did not resolve that occasional RX FIFO error.

      2017-08-07: The hang noted yesterday was due to logic that did not
        restart the poll timer in the event that Spirit was not ready when the
        time expired.  Just unconditionally performing the poll fixed this.

        Then I noticed several assertions.  In a busy radio environment, there
        are many race conditions.  Most typically, just when the driver is
        setting up to perform a transmission, the hardware commits to a
        reception.  The symptom is that the driver times out out waiting to go
        into the TX state (because it is in the RX state).  The logic needed to
        be beefed up to handle this routinely without asserting and without
        leaving the Spirit in a bad state.

        The TCP test beats the radio very hard and it is actually heartening
        that there are no failures that lead to data loss in this environment.
        I would say it is functional but  fragile in this usage, but probably
        robust in a less busy environment.

     2017-08-08:  Added broadcast packet transfers using the hub-based
        broadcast UDP client.  This appears to be a problem the HC06
        compression and/or decompression.  The decompression logic comes up
        with the destination address of ff02::ff00:00fe:3500 (which derives
        from the receiving node address of 37) instead of the all-nodes
        multicast address of ff02::0001.  It is then out of sync with the
        IPHC headers and is unable to uncompress the rest of the packet
        correctly.

        Trying again with HC1 compression, I see other isses.  The first
        frame is received correctly, but the following frames have an incorrect
        packet length and generate RX FIFO errors.  Forcing the send size to
        12 bytes of payload in apps/examples/udp (vs 96), eliminates this
        problem and the broadcast works well.

        There is probably another issue related to broadcast TX setup: If
        we are sending to the multicast or broadcast address, should we
        not also disable ACKs, retries, and RX timeouts?  What will happen
        if multiple radios ACK?  At a minimum it could keep the driver
        unnecessarily busy.  There is some prototype code to do just this
        in the driver, but does not seem to work.

      2017-08-26:  There was only a single buffer for reassemblying larger
        packets.  This could be a problem issue for the hub configuration
        which really needs the capability concurrently reassemble multiple
        incoming streams.  The design was extended to support multiple
        reassembly buffers.

        Initial testing shows the same basic behavior as noted before:
        The UDP test works and TCP test (usually) works.  There are,
        however, are errors in reported by the hub in the TCP test.
        Occasionally the test will hang when the server echoes the data
        back to the client.  These errors are presumably the result of ACKs
        from the receiver colliding with frames from the sender.

        Needs more investigation.

      2017-09-08:  The HC06 all nodes address decode problem mentioned on
        2017-08-08 has been corrected.  The behavior in the test case has
        not yet been reverified.  I suspect that there made to some radio
        configuration problems that are causing the RX FIFO errors and the
        strange broadcast behavior.  I recently got an STEVAL-IDS001V5M
        sniffer that should tell me what is going on.  But I have not yet
        had sufficient free time to continue this testing.
