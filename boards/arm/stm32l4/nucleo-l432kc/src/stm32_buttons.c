 * Description:
 *   board_button_initialize() must be called to initialize button resources.
 *   After that, board_buttons() may be called to collect the current state
 *   of all buttons or board_button_irq() may be called to register button
 *   interrupt handlers.
 *
 *   After board_button_initialize() has been called, board_buttons() may be
 *   called to collect the state of all buttons.  board_buttons() returns a
 *   32-bit bit set with each bit associated with a button.  See the
 *   BUTTON_*_BIT definitions in board.h for the meaning of each bit.
 *
 *   board_button_irq() may be called to register an interrupt handler that
 *   will be called when a button is depressed or released. The ID value is a
 *   button enumeration value that uniquely identifies a button resource. See
 *   the BUTTON_* definitions in board.h for the meaning of enumeration
 *   value.
