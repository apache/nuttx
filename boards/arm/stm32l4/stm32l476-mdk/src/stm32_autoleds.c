/* The Reference Moto Mod contains three LEDs.  Two LEDs, are by convention,
 * used to indicate the Reference Moto Mod battery state of charge, and the
 * other is available for you to use in your applications.
 *
 *   1. The red LED on PD7.  Part of the (rear-firing) red/green LED.
 *   2. The green LED on PE7.  Part of the (rear-firing) red/green LED.
 *   3. The white (top-firing) LED on PE8
 *
 * When the I/O is HIGH value, the LED is OFF.
 * When the I/O is LOW, the LED is ON.
 *
 * Following this convention, only the white LED is made available even though
 * they all could be user-application controlled if desired.
 *
 * None of the LEDs are used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is defined.
 * In that case, the white LED (only) will be controlled.  Usage by the board port
 * is defined in include/board.h and src/stm32_autoleds.c.  The white LED will be
 * used to encode OS-related events as follows:
 *
 *   ------------------ ------------------------ ------
 *   SYMBOL             Meaning                  LED
 *   ------------------ ------------------------ ------
 *
 *   LED_STARTED        NuttX has been started   OFF
 *   LED_HEAPALLOCATE   Heap has been allocated  OFF
 *   LED_IRQSENABLED    Interrupts enabled       OFF
 *   LED_STACKCREATED   Idle stack created       ON
 *   LED_INIRQ          In an interrupt          N/C
 *   LED_SIGNAL         In a signal handler      N/C
 *   LED_ASSERTION      An assertion failed      N/C
 *   LED_PANIC          The system has crashed   FLASH
 *   LED_IDLE           MCU is is sleep mode     Not used
 *
 * Thus if the white LED is statically on, NuttX has successfully  booted and is,
 * apparently, running normally.  If white LED is flashing at approximately 2Hz,
 * then a fatal error has been detected and the system has halted.
