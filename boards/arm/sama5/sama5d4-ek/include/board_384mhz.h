/* For OHCI Full-speed operations, the user has to perform the following:

 *   1) Enable UHP peripheral clock, bit (1 << AT91C_ID_UHPHS) in PMC_PCER
 *      register.
 *   2) Select PLLACK as Input clock of OHCI part, USBS bit in PMC_USB
 *      register.
 *   3) Program the OHCI clocks (UHP48M and UHP12M) with USBDIV field in
 *      PMC_USB register. USBDIV value is calculated regarding the PLLACK
 *      value and USB Full-speed accuracy.
 *   4) Enable the OHCI clocks, UHP bit in PMC_SCER register.
 *
 * "The USB Host controller requires 48 MHz and 12 MHz clocks for OHCI
 *  full-speed operations. These clocks must be generated by a PLL with a
 *  correct accuracy of ± 0.25% thanks to USBDIV field.
 *
 * "Thus the USB Host peripheral receives three clocks from the Power
 *  Management Controller (PMC): the Peripheral Clock (MCK domain), the
 *  UHP48M and the UHP12M (built-in UHP48M divided by four) used by the
 *  OHCI to interface with the bus USB signals (Recovered 12 MHz domain)
 *  in Full-speed operations"

 *
 *  The maximum value of USBDIV is 15 corresponding to a divisor of 16.
 *  REVISIT: However, using the divisor of (15+1) yields a frame rate
 *  of 500 frames per second.  A divisor of (7+1) gives the correct 1MS
 *  frame rate.  I cannot explain the factor of 2 difference.
