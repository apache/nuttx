/* After power-on reset, the SAMA5 device is running on a 12MHz internal RC.
 * When booting from SDRAM, NuttX is loaded in SDRAM by an intermediate
 * bootloader.
 * That bootloader had to have already configured the PLL and SDRAM for
 * proper operation.
 *
 * In this case, we do not reconfigure the clocking.
 * Rather, we need to query the register settings to determine the clock
 * frequencies.  We can only assume that the Main clock source is the
 * on-board 12MHz crystal.

/* The USB Host High Speed requires a 480 MHz clock (UPLLCK) for the embedded
 * High-speed transceivers. UPLLCK is the output of the 480 MHz UTMI PLL
 * (UPLL).  The source clock of the UTMI PLL is the Main OSC output:  Either
 * the 12MHz internal RC oscillator on a an external 12MHz crystal.  The
 * Main OSC must be 12MHz because the UPLL has a built-in 40x multiplier.
 *
 * For High-speed operations, the user has to perform the following:
 *
 *   1) Enable UHP peripheral clock, bit (1 << AT91C_ID_UHPHS) in
 *      PMC_PCER register.
 *   2) Write CKGR_PLLCOUNT field in PMC_UCKR register.
 *   3) Enable UPLL, bit AT91C_CKGR_UPLLEN in PMC_UCKR register.
 *   4) Wait until UTMI_PLL is locked. LOCKU bit in PMC_SR register
 *   5) Enable BIAS, bit AT91C_CKGR_BIASEN in PMC_UCKR register.
 *   6) Select UPLLCK as Input clock of OHCI part, USBS bit in PMC_USB
 *      register.
 *   7) Program the OHCI clocks (UHP48M and UHP12M) with USBDIV field in
 *      PMC_USB register. USBDIV must be 9 (division by 10) if UPLLCK is
 *      selected.
 *   8) Enable OHCI clocks, UHP bit in PMC_SCER register.
 *
 * Steps 2 through 7 performed here.  1 and 8 are performed in the EHCI
 * driver is initialized.
