/* There are two LEDs on the SAMA5D3 series-CM board that can be controlled
 * by software.  A  blue LED is controlled via PIO pins.  A red LED normally
 * provides an indication that power is supplied to the board but can also
 * be controlled via software.
 *
 *   PE25.  This blue LED is pulled high and is illuminated by pulling PE25
 *   low.
 *
 *   PE24.  The red LED is also pulled high but is driven by a transistor so
 *   that it is illuminated when power is applied even if PE24 is not
 *   configured as an output.  If PE24 is configured as an output, then the
 *   LCD is illuminated by a low output.
 *
 * These LEDs are not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
 * defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
 * include/board.h and src/sam_leds.c. The LEDs are used to encode OS-related
 * events as follows:
 *
 *   SYMBOL            Val Meaning                     LED state
 *                                                    Blue     Red
 *   ----------------- --- -----------------------  -------- --------
 *   LED_STARTED        0  NuttX has been started     OFF      OFF
 *   LED_HEAPALLOCATE   0  Heap has been allocated    OFF      OFF
 *   LED_IRQSENABLED    0  Interrupts enabled         OFF      OFF
 *   LED_STACKCREATED   1  Idle stack created         ON       OFF
 *   LED_INIRQ          2  In an interrupt              No change
 *   LED_SIGNAL         2  In a signal handler          No change
 *   LED_ASSERTION      2  An assertion failed          No change
 *   LED_PANIC          3  The system has crashed     OFF      Blinking
 *   LED_IDLE          N/A MCU is is sleep mode         Not used
 *
 * Thus if the blue LED is statically on, NuttX has successfully booted and
 * is, apparently, running normally.  If the red is flashing at
 * approximately 2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system
 * has halted.
