 *
 * Description:
 *   If CONFIG_SAMA5_BOOT_CS0FLASH, then the system is boot directly off
 *   CS0 NOR FLASH.  In this case, we assume that we get here from the
 *   primary boot loader under these conditions:
 *
 *     "If BMS signal is tied to 0, BMS_BIT is read at 1.  The ROM Code
 *      allows execution of the code contained into the memory connected to
 *      Chip Select 0 of the External Bus Interface.
 *
 *     "To achieve that, the following sequence is performed by the ROM
 *      Code:
 *
 *        - The main clock is the on-chip 12 MHz RC oscillator,
 *        - The Static Memory Controller is configured with timing allowing
 *          code execution inCS0 external memory at 12 MHz
 *        - AXI matrix is configured to remap EBI CS0 address at 0x0
 *        - 0x0 is loaded in the Program Counter register
 *
 *     "The user software in the external memory must perform the next
 *      operation in order to complete the clocks and SMC timings
 *      configuration to run at a higher clock frequency:
 *
 *        - Enable the 32768 Hz oscillator if best accuracy is needed
 *        - Reprogram the SMC setup, cycle, hold, mode timing registers
 *          for EBI CS0, to adapt them to the new clock
 *        - Program the PMC (Main Oscillator Enable or Bypass mode)
 *        - Program and Start the PLL
 *        - Switch the system clock to the new value"
 *
 *   This function provides the board-specific implementation of the logic
 *   to reprogram the SMC.
