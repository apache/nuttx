STATUS
======

1. Most of this document is a partially corrected clone of the SAMA5D4-EK
   README.txt and still contains errors and inconsistencies.

2. Coding is complete for the basic SAMA5D2-XULT NSH configuration, but
   is completely untested as of this writing (2015-09-15).  The primary
   issue is  that I have not yet determine how to load and test code.

Loading Code into SRAM with J-Link
==================================
REVISIT: Unverified, cloned text from the SAMA5D4-EK README.txt

  Loading code with the Segger tools and GDB
  ------------------------------------------

    1) Change directories into the directory where you built NuttX.
    2) Start the GDB server and wait until it is ready to accept GDB
       connections.
    3) Then run GDB like this:

         $ arm-none-eabi-gdb
         (gdb) target remote localhost:2331
         (gdb) mon reset
         (gdb) load nuttx
         (gdb) ... start debugging ...

  Loading code using J-Link Commander
  ----------------------------------

    J-Link> r
    J-Link> loadbin <file> <address>
    J-Link> setpc <address of __start>
    J-Link> ... start debugging ...

DRAMBOOT, AT25BOOT, SRAMBOOT
----------------------------

  See also boards/arm/sama5/sama5d4-xult/README.txt for a description of the DRAMBOOT
  program.  This is a tiny version of NuttX that can run out of internal
  SRAM.  If you put this program on the HSMCI1 microSD card as boot.bin, then
  it will boot on power up and you can download NuttX directly into DRAM by
  sending the nuttx.hex file over the serial connection.

  The boards/arm/sama5/sama5d4-xult/README.txt also describes variants AT25BOOT and
  SRAMBOOT.  This have not yet been ported to the SAMA5D2-XULT, but are
  available if they are useful too you.

Running NuttX from SDRAM
========================
REVISIT: Unverified, cloned text from the SAMA5D4-EK README.txt

  NuttX may be executed from SDRAM.  But this case means that the NuttX
  binary must reside on some other media (typically NAND FLASH, Serial
  FLASH) or transferred over some interface (perhaps a UARt or even a
  TFTP server).  In these cases, an intermediate bootloader such as U-Boot
  or Barebox must be used to configure the SAMA5D2 clocks and SDRAM and
  then to copy the NuttX binary into SDRAM.

  TODO:  Some drivers may require some adjustments to run from SDRAM.  That
  is because in this case macros like BOARD_MCK_FREQUENCY are not constants
  but are instead function calls:  The MCK clock frequency is not known in
  advance but instead has to be calculated from the bootloader PLL configuration.
  See the TODO list at the end of this file for further information.

  NuttX Configuration
  -------------------

  In order to run from SDRAM, NuttX must be built at origin 0x20008000 in
  SDRAM (skipping over SDRAM memory used by the bootloader).  The following
  configuration option is required:

    CONFIG_SAMA5_BOOT_SDRAM=y
    CONFIG_BOOT_RUNFROMSDRAM=y

  These options tell the NuttX code that it will be booting and running from
  SDRAM.  In this case, the start-logic will do to things:  (1) it will not
  configure the SAMA5D2 clocking.  Rather, it will use the clock configuration
  as set up by the bootloader.  And (2) it will not attempt to configure the
  SDRAM.  Since NuttX is already running from SDRAM, it must accept the SDRAM
  configuration as set up by the bootloader.

  Boot sequence
  -------------

  Reference: http://www.at91.com/linux4sam/bin/view/Linux4SAM/GettingStarted

  Several pieces of software are involved to boot a Nutt5X into SDRAM.  First
  is the primary bootloader in ROM which is in charge to check if a valid
  application is present on supported media (NOR FLASH, Serial DataFlash,
  NAND FLASH, SD card).

  The boot sequence of linux4SAM is done in several steps :

  1. The ROM bootloader checks if a valid application is present in FLASH
     and if it is the case downloads it into internal SRAM.  This program
     is usually a second level bootloader called AT91BootStrap.

  2. AT91Bootstrap is the second level bootloader. It is in charge of the
     hardware configuration.  It downloads U-Boot / Barebox binary from
     FLASH to SDRAM / DDRAM and starts the third level bootloader
     (U-Boot / Barebox)

    (see http://www.at91.com/linux4sam/bin/view/Linux4SAM/AT91Bootstrap).

  3. The third level bootloader is either U-Boot or Barebox.  The third
     level bootloader is in charge of downloading NuttX binary from FLASH,
     network, SD card, etc.  It then starts NuttX.

   4. Then NuttX runs from SDRAM

  Load NuttX with U-Boot on AT91 boards
  -------------------------------------

  Reference http://www.at91.com/linux4sam/bin/view/Linux4SAM/U-Boot

  Preparing NuttX image

    U-Boot does not support normal binary images.  Instead you have to
    create an uImage file with the mkimage tool which encapsulates kernel
    image with header information, CRC32 checksum, etc.

    mkimage comes in source code with U-Boot distribution and it is built
    during U-Boot compilation (u-boot-source-dir/tools/mkimage).  There
    are also sites where you can download pre-built mkimage binaries.  For
    example: http://www.trimslice.com/wiki/index.php/U-Boot_images

    See the U-Boot README file for more information.  More information is
    also available in the mkimage man page (for example,
    http://linux.die.net/man/1/mkimage).

    Command to generate an uncompressed uImage file (4) :

      mkimage -A arm -O linux -C none -T kernel -a 20008000 -e 20008000 \
        -n nuttx -d nuttx.bin uImage

    Where:

      -A arm: Set architecture to ARM
      -O linux: Select operating system. bootm command of u-boot changes
         boot method by os type.
      -T kernel: Set image type.
      -C none: Set compression type.
      -a 20008000:  Set load address.
      -e 20008000: Set entry point.
      -n nuttx: Set image name.
      -d nuttx.bin: Use image data from nuttx.bin.

    This will generate a binary called uImage.  If you have the path to
    mkimage in your PATH variable, then you can automatically build the
    uImage file by adding the following to your .config file:

      CONFIG_RAW_BINARY=y
      CONFIG_UBOOT_UIMAGE=y
      CONFIG_UIMAGE_LOAD_ADDRESS=0x20008000
      CONFIG_UIMAGE_ENTRY_POINT=0x20008040

    The uImage file can them be loaded into memory from a variety of sources
    (serial, SD card, JFFS2 on NAND, TFTP).

    STATUS:
      2014-4-1:  So far, I am unable to get U-Boot to execute the uImage
                 file.  I get the following error messages (in this case
                 trying to load from an SD card):

  Loading through network

    On a development system, it is useful to get the kernel and root file
    system through the network. U-Boot provides support for loading
    binaries from a remote host on the network using the TFTP protocol.

    To manage to use TFTP with U-Boot, you will have to configure a TFTP
    server on your host machine. Check your distribution manual or Internet
    resources to configure a Linux or Windows TFTP server on your host:

      - U-Boot documentation on a Linux host:
        http://www.denx.de/wiki/view/DULG/SystemSetup#Section_4.6.

      - Another TFTP configuration reference:
        http://www.linuxhomenetworking.com/wiki/index.php/Quick_HOWTO_:_Ch16_:_Telnet%2C_TFTP%2C_and_xinetd#TFTP

    On the U-Boot side, you will have to setup the networking parameters:

     1. Setup an Ethernet address (MAC address)
        Check this U-Boot network BuildRootFAQ entry to choose a proper MAC
        address: http://www.denx.de/wiki/DULG/EthernetDoesNotWork

          setenv ethaddr 00:e0:de:ad:be:ef

     2. Setup IP parameters:
        The board ip address

          setenv ipaddr 10.0.0.2

        The server ip address where the TFTP server is running

          setenv serverip 10.0.0.1

     3. saving Environment to flash

          saveenv

     4. If Ethernet Phy has not been detected during former bootup, reset
        the board to reload U-Boot : the Ethernet address and Phy
        initialization shall be ok, now

     5. Download the NuttX uImage and the root file system to a ram location
       using the U-Boot tftp command (Cf. U-Boot script capability chapter).

     6. Launch NuttX issuing a bootm or boot command.

    If the board has both emac and gmac, you can use following to choose
    which one to use:

       setenv ethact macb0,gmacb0
       setenv ethprime gmacb0

  STATUS:
    2014-3-30:  These instructions were adapted from the Linux4SAM website
                but have not yet been used.

  Using JTAG
  ----------

  This description assumes that you have a JTAG debugger such as Segger
  J-Link connected to the SAMA5D3-Xplained.

  1. Start the GDB server
  2. Start GDB
  3. Use the 'target remote localhost:xxxx' command to attach to the GDG
     server
  4. Do 'mon reset' then 'mon go' to start the internal boot loader (maybe
     U-Boot).
  5. Let the boot loader run until it completes SDRAM initialization, then
     do 'mon halt'.
  6. Now you have SDRAM initialized and you use 'load nuttx' to load the
     ELF file into SDRAM.
  7. Use 'file nuttx' to load symbols
  8. Set the PC to the NuttX entry point 'mon pc 0x20008040' and start
     nuttx using 'mon go'.

Buttons and LEDs
================

  Buttons
  -------
  A single button, PB_USER1 (PB6), is available on the SAMA5D2-XULT

    ------------------------------ ------------------- -------------------------
    SAMA5D2 PIO                    SIGNAL              USAGE
    ------------------------------ ------------------- -------------------------
    PB6                            USER_PB_PB6         PB_USER push button
    ------------------------------ ------------------- -------------------------

  Closing PB_USER will bring PB6 to ground so 1) PB6 should have a weak pull-up,
  and 2) when PB_USER is pressed, a low value will be senses.

  Support for pollable buttons is enabled with:

    CONFIG_ARCH_BUTTONS=y

  For interrupt driven buttons, add:

    CONFIG_ARCH_IRQBUTTONS=y

  Program interfaces for button access are described in nuttx/include/nuttx/arch.h

  There is an example that can be enabled to test button interrupts.  That
  example is enabled like:

    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_BUTTONS=y
    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_BUTTONS_MAX=0
    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_BUTTONS_MIN=0
    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_BUTTONS_NAME0="PB_USER"
    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_IRQBUTTONS_MAX=0
    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_IRQBUTTONS_MIN=0

  LEDs
  ----

  There is an RGB LED on board the SAMA5D2-XULT.  The RED component is driven by
  the SDHC_CD pin (PA13) and so will not be used.  The LEDs are provided VDD_LED
  and so bringing the LED low will will illuminated the LED.

    ------------------------------ ------------------- -------------------------
    SAMA5D2 PIO                    SIGNAL              USAGE
    ------------------------------ ------------------- -------------------------
    PA13                           SDHC_CD_PA13        Red LED
    PB5                            LED_GREEN_PB5       Green LED
    PB0                            LED_BLUE_PB0        Blue LED
    ------------------------------ ------------------- -------------------------

  When CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is defined in the NuttX configuration, NuttX will
  control the Green LED (only)as follows:

    SYMBOL              Meaning                 Green LED
    ------------------- ----------------------- ---------
    LED_STARTED         NuttX has been started  OFF
    LED_HEAPALLOCATE    Heap has been allocated OFF
    LED_IRQSENABLED     Interrupts enabled      OFF
    LED_STACKCREATED    Idle stack created      ON
    LED_INIRQ           In an interrupt         N/C
    LED_SIGNAL          In a signal handler     N/C
    LED_ASSERTION       An assertion failed     N/C
    LED_PANIC           The system has crashed  FLASH

  Thus if the Green LED is statically on, NuttX has successfully  booted and
  is, apparently, running normally.  If LED is flashing at approximately
  2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system has halted.

Serial Console
==============

  DEBUG / DBGU Port (J1).  There is a TTL serial connection available on
  pins 2 and 3 of the DEBUG connector.  This may be driven by UART1,
  depending upon the setting of JP2 (DBGU_PE on the schematic, DEBUG_DIS
  on the board):

  enabled in all of these configurations unless otherwise noted.

REVISIT: UART1 on the DBGU connect might be a better choice for the
default serial console

Configurations
==============

  Information Common to All Configurations
  ----------------------------------------
  Each SAMA5D2-XULT configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
  can be selected as follow:

    tools/configure.sh sama5d2-xult:<subdir>

  Before building, make sure the PATH environment variable includes the
  correct path to the directory than holds your toolchain binaries.

  And then build NuttX by simply typing the following.  At the conclusion of
  the make, the nuttx binary will reside in an ELF file called, simply, nuttx.

    make

  The <subdir> that is provided above as an argument to the tools/configure.sh
  must be is one of the following.

  NOTES:

  1. These configurations use the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
    change any of these configurations using that tool, you should:

    a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
       see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

    b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
       reconfiguration process.

  2. Unless stated otherwise, all configurations generate console
     output on the DBGU (J23).

  3. All of these configurations use the Code Sourcery for Windows toolchain
     (unless stated otherwise in the description of the configuration).  That
     toolchain selection can easily be reconfigured using 'make menuconfig'.
     Here are the relevant current settings:

     Build Setup:
       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y               : Microsoft Windows
       CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y             : Using Cygwin or other POSIX environment

     System Type -> Toolchain:
       CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y : GNU EABI toolchain for windows

  4. The SAMA5Dx is running at 528MHz by default in these configurations.

       Board Selection -> CPU Frequency
         CONFIG_SAMA5D2XULT_528MHZ=y       : Enable 528MHz operation
         CONFIG_BOARD_LOOPSPERMSEC=65775 : Calibrated on SAMA5D3-Xplained at
                                         : 528MHz running from SDRAM

  Configuration Sub-directories
  -----------------------------
  Summary:  Some of the descriptions below are long and wordy. Here is the
  concise summary of the available SAMA5D2-XULT configurations:

    nsh:  This is a basic NuttShell (NSH) configuration.

  There may be issues with some of these configurations.  See the details
  for status of individual configurations.

  Now for the gory details:

  netnsh:

    This is a network enabled configuration based on the NuttShell (NSH).
    The CDC-ECM driver is enabled, so you can plug a USB cable into the
    USB-Micro port (USB-A) and the board will appear as an CDC-ECM
    ethernet adapter.

  nsh:

    This configuration directory provide the NuttShell (NSH).  This is a
    very simple NSH configuration upon which you can build further
    functionality.

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the UART1 (PD2 and PD3) for the serial
       console.  USART1 is available at the "DBGU" RS-232 connector (J24).
       This is easily changed by reconfiguring to (1) enable a different
       serial peripheral, and (2) selecting that serial peripheral as the
       console device.

    2. By default, this configuration is set up to build on Windows
       under either a Cygwin or MSYS environment using a recent, Windows-
       native, generic ARM EABI GCC toolchain (such as the ARM supported
       toolchain).  Both the build environment and the toolchain
       selection can easily be changed by reconfiguring:

       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y           : Windows operating system
       CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y         : POSIX environment under windows
       CONFIG_ARMV7A_TOOLCHAIN_EABIW=y : Generic GCC EABI toolchain for Windows

       If you are running on Linux, make *certain* that you have
       CONFIG_HOST_LINUX=y *before* the first make or you will create a
       corrupt configuration that may not be easy to recover from. See
       the warning in the section "Information Common to All Configurations"
       for further information.

    4. This configuration supports logging of debug output to a circular
       buffer in RAM.  This feature is discussed fully in this Wiki page:
       https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NUTTX/SYSLOG . Relevant
       configuration settings are summarized below:

       File System:

       Device Drivers:
       CONFIG_RAMLOG=y             : Enable the RAM-based logging feature.
       CONFIG_RAMLOG_SYSLOG=y      : This enables the RAM-based logger as the
                                     system logger.
       CONFIG_RAMLOG_NONBLOCKING=y : Needs to be non-blocking for dmesg
       CONFIG_RAMLOG_BUFSIZE=16384 : Buffer size is 16KiB

       NOTE: This RAMLOG feature is really only of value if debug output
       is enabled.  But, by default, no debug output is disabled in this
       configuration.  Therefore, there is no logic that will add anything
       to the RAM buffer.  This feature is configured and in place only
       to support any future debugging needs that you may have.

       If you don't plan on using the debug features, then by all means
       disable this feature and save 16KiB of RAM!

       NOTE: There is an issue with capturing data in the RAMLOG:  If
       the system crashes, all of the crash dump information will into
       the RAMLOG and you will be unable to access it!  You can tell that
       the system has crashed because (a) it will be unresponsive and (b)
       the RED LED will be blinking at about 2Hz.

       That is another good reason to disable the RAMLOG!

    5. This configuration executes out of SDRAM flash and is loaded into
       SDRAM from NAND, Serial DataFlash, SD card or from a TFTPC sever via
       U-Boot, BareBox, or the DRAMBOOT configuration described above.  Data
       also is positioned in SDRAM.

       The load address is different for the DRAMBOOT program and the Linux
       bootloaders.  This can easily be reconfigured, however:

         CONFIG_SAMA5D2XULT_DRAM_BOOT=y

       See the section above entitled "Creating and Using DRAMBOOT" above
       for more information.  Here is a summary of the steps that I used
       to boot the NSH configuration:

         a. Create the DRAMBOOT program as described above.  It should be
            configured with CONFIG_SAMA5D2XULT_DRAM_START=y so that DRAMBOOT
            will immediately start the program.  You may not want to do
            this is your prefer to break in with GDB.

         b. Write the DRAMBOOT program binary (nuttx.bin) to a microSD
            card as "boot.bin".  Insert the microSD card into the boar;
            The ROM Booloader should now boot DRAMBOOT on reset and you
            should see this message:

              Send Intel HEX file now

         c. Build the NSH version of NuttX.  Send the Intel HEX of NSH
            at the prompt.  After the file is received, NSH should start
            automatically.

       At times the past, have have tested with nuttx.bin on an SD card and
       booting with U-Boot.  These are the commands that I used to boot NuttX
       from the SD card:

         U-Boot> fatload mmc 0 0x20008000 nuttx.bin
         U-Boot> go 0x20008040

    6. Board LEDs and buttons are supported as described under "Buttons and
       LEDs".  The interrupt button test is also enabled as an NSH built-in
       commands.  To run this test, you simply inter the command:

          nsh>buttons [npresses]

       The interrupt button test will log button press information to the
       syslog.  Since the RAMLOG is enabled, the SYSLOG output will be
       captured to a circular buffer in ram and may be examined using the
       NSH dmesg command:

       nsh> buttons 2
       nsh> dmesg
       maxbuttons: 2
       Attached handler at 200106f0 to button 0 [PB_USER], oldhandler:0
       IRQ:81 Button 0:PB_USER SET:01:
         PB_USER depressed
       IRQ:81 Button 0:PB_USER SET:00:
         PB_USER released
       IRQ:81 Button 0:PB_USER SET:01:
         PB_USER depressed
       IRQ:81 Button 0:PB_USER SET:00:
         PB_USER released

    7. This configuration supports /dev/null, /dev/zero, and /dev/random.

         CONFIG_DEV_NULL=y    : Enables /dev/null
         CONFIG_DEV_ZERO=y    : Enabled /dev/zero

       Support for /dev/random is implemented using the SAMA5D2's True
       Random Number Generator (TRNG).  See the section above entitled
       "TRNG and /dev/random" for information about configuring /dev/random.

        CONFIG_SAMA5_TRNG=y   : Enables the TRNG peripheral
        CONFIG_DEV_RANDOM=y   : Enables /dev/random

    8. This configuration has support for NSH built-in applications enabled.
       No built-in applications are enabled, however.

    9. This configuration has support for the FAT and PROCFS file
       systems built in.

       The FAT file system includes long file name support.  Please be aware
       that Microsoft claims patents against the long file name support (see
       more discussion in the top-level COPYING file).

         CONFIG_FS_FAT=y        : Enables the FAT file system
         CONFIG_FAT_LCNAMES=y   : Enable lower case 8.3 file names
         CONFIG_FAT_LFN=y       : Enables long file name support
         CONFIG_FAT_MAXFNAME=32 : Arbitrarily limits the size of a path
                                  segment name to 32 bytes

       The PROCFS file system is enabled simply with:

         CONFIG_FS_PROCFS=y     : Enable PROCFS file system

   10. The Real Time Clock/Calendar (RTC) is enabled in this configuration.
       See the section entitled "RTC" above for detailed configuration
       settings.

       The RTC alarm is not enabled by default since there is nothing in
       this configuration that uses it.  The alarm can easily be enabled,
       however, as described in the "RTC" section.

       The time value from the RTC will be used as the NuttX system time
       in all timestamp operations.  You may use the NSH 'date' command
       to set or view the RTC as described above in the "RTC" section.

       NOTE:  If you want the RTC to preserve time over power cycles, you
       will need to install a battery in the battery holder (J12) and close
       the jumper, JP13.

  sdmmcnsh:

    This is a configuration based on the NuttShell (NSH). The SDMMC
    peripheral is enabled, and can read and write to a VFAT filesystem
    on the SD Card.
