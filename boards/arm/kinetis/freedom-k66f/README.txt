OpenSDAv2.1
=========

  The FRDM-K66F platform features OpenSDAv2.1, the NXP open-source hardware
  embedded serial and debug adapter running an open-source bootloader.
  This circuit offers several options for serial communication, flash
  programming and run-control debugging. The openSDAv2.1 is loaded with
  JLink firmware for rapid prototyping and product development, with a focus
  on connected Internet of Things devices.

  To use set raw binary output for nuttx.bin

Serial Console
==============

  USB VCOM Console
  ----------------
  The primary serial port interface signals are PTB16 UART0_RX and PTB17
  UART0_TX. These signals are connected to the OpenSDAv2.1 VCOM circuit.

  Serial Shield Console
  ---------------------
  An alternative serial port might use a standard serial shield mounted
  on the Freedom Board.  In this case, Arduino pin D1 provides UART TX and
  pin D0 provides UART RX.

  The I/O headers on the FRDM-K66F board are arranged to enable
  compatibility with Arduino shield. The outer rows of pins (even numbered
  pins) on the headers, share the same mechanical spacing and placement with
  the I/O headers on the Arduino Revision 3 (R3) standard.

  The Arduino D0 and D1 pins then correspond to pins 2 and 4 on the J1 I/O
  connector:

    Arduino Pin              FRDM-K66F J1 Connector
    ------------------------ -----------------------
    UART RX, Arduino D0 pin  Pin 2, PTC3, UART1_RX
    UART TX, Arduino D1 pin  Pin 4, PTC4, UART1_TX

  Default Serial Console
  ----------------------
  By default, these configuration are setup to use the Serial Console on
  UART1.  That, however, is easily reconfigured.

LEDs and Buttons
================

  RGB LED
  -------
  An RGB LED is connected through GPIO as shown below:

    LED    K66
    ------ -------------------------------------------------------
    RED    PTC9/ADC1_SE5B/CMP0_IN3/FTM3_CH5/I2S0_RX_BCLK/FB_AD6/SDRAM_A14/FTM_FLT0

    BLUE   PTA11/LLWU_P23/FTM2_CH1/MII0_RXCLK/I2C2_SDA/FTM2_QD_PHB/TPM2_CH1

  If CONFIG_ARCH_LEDs is defined, then NuttX will control the LED on board the
  Freedom K66.  Usage of these LEDs is defined in include/board.h and
  src/K66_leds.c.  The following definitions describe how NuttX controls the LEDs:

    SYMBOL                Meaning                 LED state

    LED_IDLE             K66 is in sleep mode     (Optional, not used)

  Buttons
  -------
  Two push button switches, SW2 and SW3, are available on the FRDM-K66F
  board. SW2 is connected to PTD11 and SW3 is connected to PTA10.
  Beside the general purpose IO function, both SW2 and SW3 can be used
  as a low-leakage wakeup (LLWU) source.

  There is no external pull up on MDIO signal when MK66FN2M0VMD18 is
  requesting status of the Ethernet link connection. Internal pull is
  required when enabled in port configuration for MDIO signal.

                                        : the fixed addresses

  Using the network with NSH
  --------------------------

  So what can you do with this networking support?  First you see that
  NSH has several new network related commands:

    ifconfig, ifdown, ifup:  Commands to help manage your network
    get and put:             TFTP file transfers
    wget:                    HTML file transfers
    ping:                    Check for access to peers on the network
    Telnet console:          You can access the NSH remotely via telnet.

  You can also enable other add on features like full FTP or a Web
  Server or XML RPC and others.  There are also other features that
  you can enable like DHCP client (or server) or network name
  resolution.

  By default, the IP address of the FRDM-K66F will be 10.0.0.2 and
  it will assume that your host is the gateway and has the IP address
  10.0.0.1.

    nsh> ifconfig
    eth0    HWaddr 00:e0:de:ad:be:ef at UP
            IPaddr:10.0.0.2 DRaddr:10.0.0.1 Mask:255.255.255.0

  You can use ping to test for connectivity to the host (Careful,
  Window firewalls usually block ping-related ICMP traffic).  On the
  target side, you can:

    nsh> ping 10.0.0.1
    PING 10.0.0.1 56 bytes of data
    56 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 time=0 ms
    56 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 time=0 ms
    56 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=3 time=0 ms
    56 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=4 time=0 ms
    56 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=5 time=0 ms
    56 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=6 time=0 ms
    56 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=7 time=0 ms
    56 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=8 time=0 ms
    56 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=9 time=0 ms
    56 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=10 time=0 ms
    10 packets transmitted, 10 received, 0% packet loss, time 10100 ms

  NOTE: In this configuration is is normal to have packet loss > 0%
  the first time you ping due to the default handling of the ARP
  table.

  On the host side, you should also be able to ping the FRDM-K66F:

    $ ping 10.0.0.2

  You can also log into the NSH from the host PC like this:

    $ telnet 10.0.0.2
    Trying 10.0.0.2...
    Connected to 10.0.0.2.
    Escape character is '^]'.

    Builtin Apps:
    nsh>

  NOTE:  If you enable this networking as described above, you will
  experience a delay on booting NSH.  That is because the start-up logic
  waits for the network connection to be established before starting
  NuttX.  In a real application, you would probably want to do the
  network bringup on a separate thread so that access to the NSH prompt
  is not delayed.

  This delay will be especially long if the board is not connected to
  a network.  On the order of minutes!  You will probably think that
  NuttX has crashed!  And then, when it finally does come up after
  numerous timeouts and retries, the network will not be available --
  even if the network cable is plugged in later.

  The long delays can be eliminated by using a separate the network
  initialization thread discussed below.  Recovering after the network
  becomes available requires the network monitor feature, also discussed
  below.

  Network Initialization Thread
  -----------------------------
  There is a configuration option enabled by CONFIG_NSH_NETINIT_THREAD
  that will do the NSH network bring-up asynchronously in parallel on
  a separate thread.  This eliminates the (visible) networking delay
  altogether.  This current implementation, however, has some limitations:

    - If no network is connected, the network bring-up will fail and
      the network initialization thread will simply exit.  There are no
      retries and no mechanism to know if the network initialization was
      successful (it could perform a network Ioctl to see if the link is
      up and it now, keep trying, but it does not do that now).

    - Furthermore, there is currently no support for detecting loss of
      network connection and recovery of the connection (similarly, this
      thread could poll periodically for network status, but does not).

  Both of these shortcomings could be eliminated by enabling the network
  monitor:

  Network Monitor
  ---------------
  By default the network initialization thread will bring-up the network
  then exit, freeing all of the resources that it required.  This is a
  good behavior for systems with limited memory.

  If the CONFIG_NSH_NETINIT_MONITOR option is selected, however, then the
  network initialization thread will persist forever; it will monitor the
  network status.  In the event that the network goes down (for example, if
  a cable is removed), then the thread will monitor the link status and
  attempt to bring the network back up.  In this case the resources
  required for network initialization are never released.

  Pre-requisites:

    - CONFIG_NSH_NETINIT_THREAD as described above.

    - The K66F EMAC block does not support PHY interrupts.  The KSZ8081
      PHY interrupt line is brought to a jumper block and it should be
      possible to connect that some some interrupt port pin.  You would
      need to provide some custom logic in the Freedcom K66F
      configuration to set up that PHY interrupt.

    - In addition to the PHY interrupt, the Network Monitor also requires the
      following setting:

        CONFIG_NETDEV_PHY_IOCTL. Enable PHY IOCTL commands in the Ethernet
        device driver. Special IOCTL commands must be provided by the Ethernet
        driver to support certain PHY operations that will be needed for link
        management. There operations are not complex and are implemented for
        the Atmel SAMA5 family.

        CONFIG_ARCH_PHY_INTERRUPT. This is not a user selectable option.
        Rather, it is set when you select a board that supports PHY
        interrupts.  For the K66F, like most other architectures, the PHY
        interrupt must be provided via some board-specific GPIO.  In any
        event, the board-specific logic must provide support for the PHY
        interrupt. To do this, the board logic must do two things: (1) It
        must provide the function arch_phy_irq() as described and prototyped
        in the nuttx/include/nuttx/arch.h, and (2) it must select
        CONFIG_ARCH_PHY_INTERRUPT in the board configuration file to
        advertise that it supports arch_phy_irq().

        One other thing: UDP support is required (CONFIG_NET_UDP).

  Given those prerequisites, the network monitor can be selected with these
  additional settings.

    System Type -> Kinetis Ethernet Configuration
      CONFIG_ARCH_PHY_INTERRUPT=y           : (auto-selected)
      CONFIG_NETDEV_PHY_IOCTL=y             : (auto-selected)

    Application Configuration -> NSH Library -> Networking Configuration

      CONFIG_NSH_NETINIT_RETRYMSEC=2000     : Configure the network monitor as you like
      CONFIG_NSH_NETINIT_SIGNO=18

SD Card Support
===============

  Card Slot
  ---------
  A micro Secure Digital (SD) card slot is available on the FRDM-K66F connected to
  the SD Host Controller (SDHC) signals of the MCU. This slot will accept micro
  format SD memory cards. The SD card detect pin (PTD10) is an open switch that
  shorts with VDD when card is inserted.

      CONFIG_BOARDCTL=y                 : Or
      CONFIG_BOARD_LATE_INITIALIZE=y

  Using the SD card
  -----------------

  1. After booting, the SDHC device will appear as /dev/mmcsd0.
  2. If you try mounting an SD card with nothing in the slot, the mount will
     fail:

       nsh> mount -t vfat /dev/mmcsd0 /mnt/sd0
       nsh: mount: mount failed: 19

     NSH can be configured to provide errors as strings instead of
     numbers.  But in this case, only the error number is reported.  The
     error numbers can be found in nuttx/include/errno.h:

       #define ENODEV              19
       #define ENODEV_STR          "No such device"

     So the mount command is saying that there is no device or, more
     correctly, that there is no card in the SD card slot.

  3. Insert the SD card.  Then the mount should succeed.

      nsh> mount -t vfat /dev/mmcsd0 /mnt/sd0
      nsh> ls /mnt/sd1
      /mnt/sd1:
       atest.txt
      nsh> cat /mnt/sd1/atest.txt
      This is a test

     NOTE:  See the next section entitled "Auto-Mounter" for another way
     to mount your SD card.

  4. Before removing the card, you must umount the file system.  This is
     equivalent to "ejecting" or "safely removing" the card on Windows:  It
     flushes any cached data to an SD card and makes the SD card unavailable
     to the applications.

       nsh> umount -t /mnt/sd0

     It is now safe to remove the card.  NuttX provides into callbacks
     that can be used by an application to automatically unmount the
     volume when it is removed.  But those callbacks are not used in
     these configurations.

  Auto-Mounter
  ------------
  NuttX implements an auto-mounter than can make working with SD cards
  easier.  With the auto-mounter, the file system will be automatically
  mounted when the SD card is inserted into the SDHC slot and automatically
  unmounted when the SD card is removed.

  Here is a sample configuration for the auto-mounter:

    File System Configuration
      CONFIG_FS_AUTOMOUNTER=y

    Board-Specific Options
      CONFIG_FRDMK66F_SDHC_AUTOMOUNT=y
      CONFIG_FRDMK66F_SDHC_AUTOMOUNT_FSTYPE="vfat"
      CONFIG_FRDMK66F_SDHC_AUTOMOUNT_BLKDEV="/dev/mmcsd0"
      CONFIG_FRDMK66F_SDHC_AUTOMOUNT_MOUNTPOINT="/mnt/sdcard"
      CONFIG_FRDMK66F_SDHC_AUTOMOUNT_DDELAY=1000
      CONFIG_FRDMK66F_SDHC_AUTOMOUNT_UDELAY=2000

  WARNING:  SD cards should never be removed without first unmounting
  them.  This is to avoid data and possible corruption of the file
  system.  Certainly this is the case if you are writing to the SD card
  at the time of the removal.  If you use the SD card for read-only access,
  however, then I cannot think of any reason why removing the card without
  mounting would be harmful.

USB Device Controller Support
==============================

  USB Device Controller Support
  -----------------------------
  The USBHS device controller driver is enabled with he following
  configurationsettings:

    Device Drivers -> USB Device Driver Support
      CONFIG_USBDEV=y                           : Enable USB device support
    For full-speed/low-power mode:
      CONFIG_USBDEV_DUALSPEED=n                 : Disable High speed support
    For high-speed/normal mode:
      CONFIG_USBDEV_DUALSPEED=y                 : Enable High speed support
      CONFIG_USBDEV_DMA=y                       : Enable DMA methods
      CONFIG_USBDEV_MAXPOWER=100                : Maximum power consumption
      CONFIG_USBDEV_SELFPOWERED=y               : Self-powered device

    System Type -> Kinetis Peripheral Selection
      CONFIG_KINETIS_USBOTG=y

  CDC/ACM Device Class
  --------------------
  In order to be usable, you must all enabled some class driver(s) for the
  USBHS device controller.  Here, for example, is how to configure the CDC/ACM
  serial device class:

    Device Drivers -> USB Device Driver Support
      CONFIG_CDCACM=y                           : USB Modem (CDC ACM) support
      CONFIG_CDCACM_EP0MAXPACKET=64             : Endpoint 0 packet size
      CONFIG_CDCACM_EPINTIN=1                   : Interrupt IN endpoint number
      CONFIG_CDCACM_EPINTIN_FSSIZE=64           : Full speed packet size
      CONFIG_CDCACM_EPINTIN_HSSIZE=64           : High speed packet size
      CONFIG_CDCACM_EPBULKOUT=3                 : Bulk OUT endpoint number
      CONFIG_CDCACM_EPBULKOUT_FSSIZE=64         : Full speed packet size
      CONFIG_CDCACM_EPBULKOUT_HSSIZE=512        : High speed packet size
      CONFIG_CDCACM_EPBULKIN=2                  : Bulk IN endpoint number
      CONFIG_CDCACM_EPBULKIN_FSSIZE=64          : Full speed packet size
      CONFIG_CDCACM_EPBULKIN_HSSIZE=512         : High speed packet size
      CONFIG_CDCACM_NWRREQS=4                   : Number of write requests
      CONFIG_CDCACM_NRDREQS=8                   : Number of read requests
      CONFIG_CDCACM_BULKIN_REQLEN=96            : Size of write request buffer (for full speed)
      CONFIG_CDCACM_BULKIN_REQLEN=768           : Size of write request buffer (for high speed)
      CONFIG_CDCACM_RXBUFSIZE=257               : Serial read buffer size
      CONFIG_CDCACM_TXBUFSIZE=193               : Serial transmit buffer size (for full speed)
      CONFIG_CDCACM_TXBUFSIZE=769               : Serial transmit buffer size (for high speed)
      CONFIG_CDCACM_VENDORID=0x0525             : Vendor ID
      CONFIG_CDCACM_PRODUCTID=0xa4a7            : Product ID
      CONFIG_CDCACM_VENDORSTR="NuttX"           : Vendor string
      CONFIG_CDCACM_PRODUCTSTR="CDC/ACM Serial" : Product string

    Device Drivers -> Serial Driver Support
      CONFIG_SERIAL_REMOVABLE=y                 : Support for removable serial device

  The CDC/ACM application provides commands to connect and disconnect the
  CDC/ACM serial device:

    CONFIG_SYSTEM_CDCACM=y                     : Enable connect/disconnect support
    CONFIG_SYSTEM_CDCACM_DEVMINOR=0            : Use device /dev/ttyACM0
    CONFIG_CDCACM_RXBUFSIZE=???                : A large RX may be needed

  If you include this CDC/ACM application, then you can connect the CDC/ACM
  serial device to the host by entering the command 'sercon' and you detach
  the serial device with the command 'serdis'.  If you do no use this
  application, they you will have to write logic in your board initialization
  code to initialize and attach the USB device.

Development Environment
=======================

  Either Linux or Cygwin on Windows can be used for the development environment.
  The source has been built only using the GNU toolchain (see below).  Other
  toolchains will likely cause problems. Testing was performed using the Cygwin
  environment.

GNU Toolchain Options
=====================

  The NuttX make system supports several GNU-based toolchains under Linux,
  Cygwin under Windows, and Windows native.  To select a toolchain:

  1. Use 'make menuconfig' and select the toolchain that you are using
     under the System Type menu.
  2. The default toolchain is the NuttX buildroot under Linux or Cygwin:

    CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT=y

Configurations
==============

Each Freedom K66F configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
can be selected as follow:

    tools/configure.sh freedom-K66F:<subdir>

Where <subdir> is one of the following:

  netnsh:
  ------
    This configuration is identical to the nsh configuration described
    below except that networking support is enabled.

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
       change this configuration using that tool, you should:

       a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
          see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

       b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.

    2. Default platform/toolchain:

       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y               : Cygwin under Windows
       CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y
       CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y : ARM/mbed toolcahin (arm-none-elf-gcc)
       CONFIG_INTELHEX_BINARY=y            : Output formats: Intel hex binary

    3. The Serial Console is provided on UART1 with the correct pin
       configuration for use with an Arduino Serial Shield.

    4. SDHC support is not enabled in this configuration.  Refer to the
       configuration settings listed above under "SD Card Support".

    5. Support for NSH built-in applications is enabled, but no built-in
       applications have been configured in.

    6. No external pullup is available on MDIO signal when MK66FN1M0VLL12 MCU
       is requests status of the Ethernet link connection. Internal pullup is
       required when port configuration for MDIO signal is enabled:

       CONFIG_KINETIS_ENET_MDIOPULLUP=y

    7. Configured to use a fixed IPv4 address:

       CONFIG_NSH_IPADDR=0x0a000002
       CONFIG_NSH_DRIPADDR=0x0a000001
       CONFIG_NSH_NETMASK=0xffffff00

       And a bogus MAC address:

       CONFIG_NSH_NOMAC=y
       CONFIG_NSH_SWMAC=y
       CONFIG_NETINIT_MACADDR=0x00e0deadbeef

  nsh:
  ---
    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at apps/examples/nsh using a
    serial console on UART1.

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
       change this configuration using that tool, you should:

       a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
          see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

       b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.

    2. Default platform/toolchain:

         CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y               : Cygwin under Windows
         CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y
         CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y : ARM/mbed toolcahin (arm-none-elf-gcc)
         CONFIG_INTELHEX_BINARY=y            : Output formats: Intel hex binary

    3. The Serial Console is provided on UART1 with the correct pin
       configuration to use a RS-232 shield. This can be switched to UART0
       for use with the OpenSDAv2.1 VCOM by reconfiguring the serial console.

         +CONFIG_KINETIS_UART0=y
         -CONFIG_KINETIS_UART1=y
         +CONFIG_UART0_SERIALDRIVER=y
         -CONFIG_UART1_SERIALDRIVER=y
         +CONFIG_UART0_SERIAL_CONSOLE=y
         -CONFIG_UART1_SERIAL_CONSOLE=y
         +CONFIG_UART0_RXBUFSIZE=256
         -CONFIG_UART1_RXBUFSIZE=256
         +CONFIG_UART0_TXBUFSIZE=256
         -CONFIG_UART1_TXBUFSIZE=256
         +CONFIG_UART0_BAUD=115200
         1CONFIG_UART1_BAUD=115200
         +CONFIG_UART0_BITS=8
         -CONFIG_UART1_BITS=8
         +CONFIG_UART0_PARITY=0
         -CONFIG_UART1_PARITY=0
         +CONFIG_UART0_2STOP=0
         -CONFIG_UART1_2STOP=0

       NOTE: On my Windows 10 / Cygwin64 system, the OpenSDAv2.1 VCOM is not
       recognized.  I probably need to install a driver?

       There is a serial USB driver on the mbed web site.  However, this
       driver would not install on Windows 10 for me.  I understand that
       it installs OK on Windows 7.

    4. Support for NSH built-in applications is enabled, but no built-in
       applications have been configured in.

    5. An SDHC driver is enabled in this configuration but does not yet work.
       The basic problem seems to be that it does not sense the presence of
       the SD card on PTD10.  No interrupts are generated when the SD card is
       inserted or removed.  You might want to disable SDHC and MMC/SD if
       you are using this configuration.  Refer to the configuration
       settings listed above under "SD Card Support".
       TODO:Verify Claim

Status
======

  2016-07-12:  Added support for the KSZ8081 PHY and added the netnsh
    configuration.  The network is basically functional.  More testing is
    needed, but I have not seen any obvious network failures.

    In testing, I notice a strange thing.  If I run at full optimization the
    code runs (albeit with bugs-to-be-solved).  But with no optimization or
    even at -O1, the system fails to boot.  This seems to be related to the
    watchdog timer - this is due to the fact that in-lined get/putreg are
    not inlined and the delay allows for the WD to timeout.

  2016-07-13:  Add SD automounter logic; broke out SDHC logic into a separate
    file.  The nsh configuration now has SDHC enabled be default.  Does not
    yet work.  The basic problem seems to be that it does not sense the
    presence of the SD card on PTE6.  No interrupts are generated when the
    SD card is inserted or removed.  You might want to disable SDHC and
    MMC/SD if you are using this configuration.

    The nsh configuration now builds successfully with USB device enabled.
    USB device, however, has not yet been tested.  I have not yet looked
    into 48MHz clocking requirements.

  2017-02-14:  nsh: SDHC DMA is not working yet. Buttons and SDIO with
    automounter is working.
    netnsh:Is building but Ethernet is not working yet. TX is called but
    not IRQ is issued.
