This directory contains the port of NuttX to the Adafruit QT Py RP2040.
See https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qt-py-2040 for information 
about Adafruit QT Py RP2040.

Currently only the following devices are supported.

  Supported:
  - UART  (console port)
    - GPIO 5 (UART1 RX) and GPIO 20 (UART1 TX) are used for the console.
  - I2C
  - SPI
  - DMAC
  - PWM
  - ADC
  - USB device
    - MSC, CDC/ACM serial and these composite device are supported.
    - CDC/ACM serial device can be used for the console.
  - PIO (RP2040 Programmable I/O)
  - Flash ROM Boot
  - SRAM Boot
    - If Pico SDK is available, nuttx.uf2 file which can be used in
      BOOTSEL mode will be created.

  Not supported:
  - All other devices

Installation
============

1. Download Raspberry Pi Pico SDK

  $ git clone -b 1.1.2 https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git

2. Set PICO_SDK_PATH environment variable

  $ export PICO_SDK_PATH=<absolute_path_to_pico-sdk_directory>

3. Configure and build NuttX

  $ git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx.git nuttx
  $ git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-nuttx-apps.git apps
  $ cd nuttx
  $ make distclean
  $ ./tools/configure.sh raspberrypi-pico:nsh
  $ make V=1

4. Connect Adafruit KB2040 board to USB port while pressing BOOTSEL.
   The board will be detected as USB Mass Storage Device.
   Then copy "nuttx.uf2" into the device.
   (Same manner as the standard Pico SDK applications installation.)

5. To access the console, GPIO 20 (TX) and 5 (RX) pins must be connected to a
   device such as USB-serial converter.

   `usbnsh` configuration provides the console access by USB CDC/ACM serial
   devcice.  The console is available by using a terminal software on the USB
   host.

Defconfigs
==========

- nsh
    Minimum configuration with NuttShell

- nshsram
    Load NuttX binary to SRAM
  
- smp
    Enable SMP mode. Both Core 0 and Core 1 are used by NuttX.

- usbnsh
    USB CDC/ACM serial console with NuttShell

- composite
    USB composite device (MSC + CDC/ACM) support
    `conn` command enables the composite device.

License exceptions
