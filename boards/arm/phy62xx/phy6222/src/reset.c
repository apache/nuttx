 * Name: board_reset
 *
 * Description:
 *   Reset board.  Support for this function is required by board-level
 *   logic if CONFIG_BOARDCTL_RESET is selected.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   status - Status information provided with the reset event.  This
 *            meaning of this status information is board-specific.  If not
 *            used by a board, the value zero may be provided in calls to
 *            board_reset().
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   If this function returns, then it was not possible to power-off the
 *   board due to some constraints.  The return value int this case is a
 *   board-specific reason for the failure to shutdown.
