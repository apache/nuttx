choice
	prompt "Execution memory"
	default METRO_M4_RUNFROMFLASH

config METRO_M4_RUNFROMFLASH
	bool "Run from FLASH"
	select BOOT_RUNFROMFLASH
	---help---
		This is the normal configuration for building METRO M4 code.

config METRO_M4_RUNFROMSRAM
	bool "Run from SRAM"
	select BOOT_RUNFROMISRAM
	---help---
		During early bring-up, it is safer to execute entirely from
		SRAM until you are confident in the initialization logic.
		Then you can safely switch to FLASH.

		REVISIT:  This auto-selects CONFIG_BOOT_RUNFROMISRAM but I have
		found, with some difficulty, that that choice still defaults to
		CONFIG_BOOT_RUNFROMFLASH, causing link-time failures when running
		from SRAM.

config METRO_M4_32KHZXTAL
	bool "32.768 KHz XTAL"
	default n
	---help---
		According to the schematic, a 32.768 KHz crystal is installed  on
		board.  However, I have been unable to use this crystal and thought
		perhaps it is missing or defective on my board (there is a metal
		package that could be a crystal on board, but I am not certain).
		Another, more likely option is that there is a coding error on my
		part that prevents the 32.768 KHz crystal from usable(?)

		The configuration defaults to using the always-on OSCULP32 as the
		slow clock source.  This option will select instead XOSC32 as the
		slow clock source.
