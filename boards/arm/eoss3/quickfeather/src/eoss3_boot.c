 * Name: eoss3_boardinitialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   All EOS S3 architectures must provide the following entry point.  This
 *   entry point is called early in the initialization -- after all memory
 *   has been configured and mapped but before any devices have been
 *   initialized.

 * Name: board_late_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   If CONFIG_BOARD_LATE_INITIALIZE is selected, then an additional
 *   initialization call will be performed in the boot-up sequence to a
 *   function called board_late_initialize().  board_late_initialize() will
 *   be called immediately after up_initialize() is called and just before
 *   the initial application is started.  This additional initialization
 *   phase may be used, for example, to initialize board-specific device
 *   drivers.
