/* LEDs
 *
 * There are two yellow LED available on the SAM V71 Xplained Ultra board that
 * can be turned on and off.  The LEDs can be activated by driving the
 * connected I/O line to GND.
 *
 *   ------ ----------- ---------------------
 *   SAMV71 Function    Shared functionality
 *   GPIO
 *   ------ ----------- ---------------------
 *   PA23   Yellow LED0 EDBG GPIO
 *   PC09   Yellow LED1 LCD, and Shield
 *   ------ ----------- ---------------------
 *
 * These LEDs are not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
 * defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
 * include/board.h and src/sam_autoleds.c. The LEDs are used to encode
 * OS-related events as follows:
 *
 *   -------------------  -----------------------  -------- --------
 *   SYMBOL                Meaning                     LED state
 *                                                   LED0     LED1
 *   -------------------  -----------------------  -------- --------
 *   LED_STARTED          NuttX has been started     OFF      OFF
 *   LED_HEAPALLOCATE     Heap has been allocated    OFF      OFF
 *   LED_IRQSENABLED      Interrupts enabled         OFF      OFF
 *   LED_STACKCREATED     Idle stack created         ON       OFF
 *   LED_INIRQ            In an interrupt              No change
 *   LED_SIGNAL           In a signal handler          No change
 *   LED_ASSERTION        An assertion failed          No change
 *   LED_PANIC            The system has crashed     N/C      Blinking
 *   LED_IDLE             MCU is is sleep mode         Not used
 *   -------------------  -----------------------  -------- --------
 *
 * Thus if LED0 is statically on, NuttX has successfully booted and is,
 * apparently, running normally.  If LED1 is flashing at approximately
 * 2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system has halted.
 *
 * NOTE: That LED0 is not used after completion of booting and may
 * be used by other board-specific logic.
