 * Description:
 *   All SAMV7 architectures must provide the following entry point.  This
 *   entry point is called early in the initialization -- after clocking and
 *   memory have been configured but before caches have been enabled and
 *   before any devices have been initialized.

   * source for the timer/counters.  The ideal frequency could be:
   *
   *  frequency = 1,000,000 / CONFIG_USEC_PER_TICK
   *
   * The main crystal is selected as the frequency source.  The maximum
   * prescaler value is 256 so the minimum frequency is 46,875 Hz which
   * corresponds to a period of 21.3 microseconds.  A value of
   * CONFIG_USEC_PER_TICK=20, or 50KHz, would give an exact solution with
   * a divider of 240.
