README
======

This README discusses issues unique to NuttX configurations for the
Atmel SAMD20 Xplained Pro development board.  This board features the
ATSAMD20J18A MCU.

The SAMD20 Xplained Pro Starter Kit may be bundled with three modules:

1) I/O1   - An MMC/SD card slot, PWM LED control, ADC light sensor, USART
            loopback, TWI AT30TSE758 Temperature sensor.
2) OLED1  - An OLED plus 3 additional switches and 3 additional LEDs
3) PROTO1 - A prototyping board with logic on board (other than power-related
            logic).

STATUS/ISSUES
=============

    1. The FLASH wait states is set to 2 (see include/board.h).  According to
       the data sheet, it should work at 1 but I sometimes see crashes when
       the wait states are set to one (about half of the time) (2014-2-18).

    2. Garbage appears on the display sometimes after a reset (maybe 20% of
       the time) or after a power cycle (less after a power cycle).  I don't
       understand the cause of this but most of this can be eliminated by
       simply holding the reset button longer and releasing it cleanly
       (then it fails maybe 5-10% of the time, maybe because of button
       chatter?) (2014-2-18).

       - The garbage is not random:  It is always the same.
       - This is not effected by BAUD rate.  Curiously, the same garbage
         appears at different BAUD settings implying that this may not even
         be clock related???
       - The program seems to be running normally, just producing bad output.

    3. SPI current hangs so not much progress has been made testing the I/O1
       module.  The hang occurs because the SPI is waiting for SYNCBUSY to
       be cleared after enabling the SPI.  This even does not happen and so
       causes the hang.

       Another note:  Enabling the SPI on SERCOM0 also seems to interfere
       with the USART output on SERCOM4.  Both symptoms imply some clock-
       related issue.

       The configuration suggests CONFIG_MMCSD_HAVE_CARDDETECT=y, but as of
       this writing, there is no support for EIC pin interrupts.

    4. OLED1 module is untested.  These instructions were just lifted from
       the SAM4L Xplained Pro README.txt file.

Modules
=======

  The SAMD20 Xplained Pro Starter Kit is bundled with four modules:

  I/O1
  ----
    The primary function of this module is to provide SD card support, but
    the full list of modules features include:

    - microSD card connector (SPI interface)
    - PWM (LED control)
    - ADC (light sensor)
    - USART loopback
    - TWI AT30TSE758 Temperature sensor with EEPROM

    SPI is available on two of the SAMD20 Xplained connectors, EXT1 and EXT2.
    They mate with the I/O1 connector as indicated in this table.

    Card Detect
    -----------
    When a microSD card is put into the connector SW_A and SW_B are short-
    circuited. SW_A is connected to the microSD_DETECT signal. To use this
    as a card indicator remember to enable internal pullup in the target
    device.

    See the set-up in the discussion of the nsh configuration below for other
    required configuration options.

  PROTO1
  ------
  A prototyping board with logic on board (other than power-related logic).
  There is no built-in support for the PROTO1 module.

Development Environment
=======================

  Either Linux or Cygwin on Windows can be used for the development environment.
  The source has been built only using the GNU toolchain (see below).  Other
  toolchains will likely cause problems. Testing was performed using the Cygwin
  environment.

GNU Toolchain Options
=====================


  The NuttX make system can be configured to support the various different
  toolchain options.  All testing has been conducted using the NuttX buildroot
  toolchain.  To use alternative toolchain, you simply need to add change of
  the following configuration options to your .config (or defconfig) file:

    CONFIG_ARMV6M_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT=y  : NuttX buildroot under Linux or Cygwin (default)
    CONFIG_ARMV6M_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIL=y  : Generic GCC ARM EABI toolchain for Linux
    CONFIG_ARMV6M_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y  : Generic GCC ARM EABI toolchain for Windows

  NOTE about Windows native toolchains
  ------------------------------------

  There are basically three kinds of GCC toolchains that can be used:

    1. A Linux native toolchain in a Linux environment,
    2. The buildroot Cygwin tool chain built in the Cygwin environment,
    3. A Windows native toolchain.

  There are several limitations to using a Windows based toolchain (#3) in a
  Cygwin environment.  The three biggest are:

  1. The Windows toolchain cannot follow Cygwin paths.  Path conversions are
     performed automatically in the Cygwin makefiles using the 'cygpath'
     utility but you might easily find some new path problems.  If so, check
     out 'cygpath -w'

  2. Windows toolchains cannot follow Cygwin symbolic links.  Many symbolic
     links are used in NuttX (e.g., include/arch).  The make system works
     around these problems for the Windows tools by copying directories
     instead of linking them. But this can also cause some confusion for
     you:  For example, you may edit a file in a "linked" directory and find
     that your changes had no effect.  That is because you are building the
     copy of the file in the "fake" symbolic directory.  If you use a
     Windows toolchain, you should get in the habit of making like this:

       make clean_context all

     An alias in your .bashrc file might make that less painful.

IDEs
====

  NuttX is built using command-line make.  It can be used with an IDE, but some
  effort will be required to create the project.

  Makefile Build
  --------------
  Under Eclipse, it is pretty easy to set up an "empty makefile project" and
  simply use the NuttX makefile to build the system.  That is almost for free
  under Linux.  Under Windows, you will need to set up the "Cygwin GCC" empty
  makefile project in order to work with Windows (Google for "Eclipse Cygwin" -
  there is a lot of help on the internet).

  Native Build
  ------------
  Here are a few tips before you start that effort:

  1) Select the toolchain that you will be using in your .config file
  2) Start the NuttX build at least one time from the Cygwin command line
     before trying to create your project.  This is necessary to create
     certain auto-generated files and directories that will be needed.
  3) Set up include paths:  You will need include/, arch/arm/src/sam34,
     arch/arm/src/common, arch/arm/src/armv7-m, and sched/.
  4) All assembly files need to have the definition option -D __ASSEMBLY__
     on the command line.

  Startup files will probably cause you some headaches.  The NuttX startup file
  is arch/arm/src/sam34/sam_vectors.S.  You may need to build NuttX
  one time from the Cygwin command line in order to obtain the pre-built
  startup object needed by an IDE.

NuttX EABI "buildroot" Toolchain
================================

  A GNU GCC-based toolchain is assumed.  The PATH environment variable should
  be modified to point to the correct path to the Cortex-M0 GCC toolchain (if
  different from the default in your PATH variable).

  If you have no Cortex-M0 toolchain, one can be downloaded from the NuttX
  Bitbucket download site (https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/buildroot/downloads/).
  This GNU toolchain builds and executes in the Linux or Cygwin environment.

  1. You must have already configured NuttX in <some-dir>/nuttx.

     tools/configure.sh samd20-xplained:<sub-dir>

  2. Download the latest buildroot package into <some-dir>

  3. unpack the buildroot tarball.  The resulting directory may
     have versioning information on it like buildroot-x.y.z.  If so,
     rename <some-dir>/buildroot-x.y.z to <some-dir>/buildroot.

  4. cd <some-dir>/buildroot

  5. cp boards/cortexm0-eabi-defconfig-4.6.3 .config

  6. make oldconfig

  7. make

  8. Make sure that the PATH variable includes the path to the newly built
     binaries.

  See the file boards/README.txt in the buildroot source tree.  That has more
  details PLUS some special instructions that you will need to follow if you are
  building a Cortex-M0 toolchain for Cygwin under Windows.

LEDs
====

  There is one yellow LED available on the SAM D20 Xplained Pro board that
  can be turned on and off. The LED can be activated by driving the connected
  PA14 I/O line to GND.

  When CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is defined in the NuttX configuration, NuttX will
  control the LED as follows:

    SYMBOL              Meaning                 LED0
    ------------------- ----------------------- ------
    LED_STARTED         NuttX has been started  OFF

    LED_SIGNAL          In a signal handler     N/C
    LED_ASSERTION       An assertion failed     N/C
    LED_PANIC           The system has crashed  FLASH

  Thus is LED is statically on, NuttX has successfully  booted and is,
  apparently, running normally.  If LED is flashing at approximately
  2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system has halted.

Serial Consoles
===============

  SERCOM4
  ------

  SERCOM4 is available on connectors EXT1, EXT2, and EXT3, but using
  different PORT pins:

    PIN   EXT1 EXT2 EXT3 GPIO Function
    ----  ---- ---- ---- ------------------
     13   PB09 PB13 PB11 SERCOM4 / USART RX
     14   PB08 PB12 PB12 SERCOM4 / USART TX
     19   GND  GND  GND  N/A
     20   VCC  VCC  VCC  N/A

  There are options available in the NuttX configuration to select which
  connector SERCOM4 is on:  SAMD20_XPLAINED_USART4_EXTn, where n=1, 2, or 3.

  If you have a TTL to RS-232 converter then this is the most convenient
  serial console to use (because you don't lose the console device each time
  you lose the USB connection).  It is the default in all of these
  configurations.  An option is to use the virtual COM port.

  Virtual COM Port
  ----------------

  The SAMD20 Xplained Pro contains an Embedded Debugger (EDBG) that can be
  used to program and debug the ATSAMD20J18A using Serial Wire Debug (SWD).
  The Embedded debugger also include a Virtual COM port interface over
  SERCOM3.  Virtual COM port connections:

    PA24 SERCOM3 / USART TXD
    PA25 SERCOM3 / USART RXD

Atmel Studio 6.1
================

  Loading Code into FLASH:
  -----------------------

  Tools menus:  Tools -> Device Programming.

  Debugging the NuttX Object File
  -------------------------------

  1) Rename object file from nutt to nuttx.elf.  That is an extension that
     will be recognized by the file menu.

  2) File menu: File -> Open -> Open object file for debugging

     - Select nuttx.elf object file
     - Select AT91SAMD20J18
     - Select files for symbols as desired
     - Select debugger

  3) Debug menu: Debug -> Start debugging and break

     - This will reload the nuttx.elf file into FLASH

Configurations
==============

  Each SAMD20 Xplained Pro configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
  can be selected as follow:

    tools/configure.sh samd20-xplained:<subdir>

  Before building, make sure that the PATH environment variable include the
  correct path to the directory than holds your toolchain binaries.

  And then build NuttX by simply typing the following.  At the conclusion of
  the make, the nuttx binary will reside in an ELF file called, simply, nuttx.

    make

  The <subdir> that is provided above as an argument to the tools/configure.sh
  must be is one of the following.

  NOTE:  These configurations use the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
  change any of these configurations using that tool, you should:

    a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
       see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

    b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
       reconfiguration process.

  NOTES:

  1. These configurations use the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
    change any of these configurations using that tool, you should:

    a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
       see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

    b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
       reconfiguration process.

  2. Unless stated otherwise, all configurations generate console
     output of on SERCOM4 which is available on EXT1, EXT2, or EXT3 (see
     the section "Serial Consoles" above).  The virtual COM port could
     be used, instead, by reconfiguring to use SERCOM3 instead of
     SERCOM4:

       System Type -> SAMD/L Peripheral Support
         CONFIG_SAMD2L2_SERCOM3=y  : Enable one or both
         CONFIG_SAMD2L2_SERCOM4=n

       Device Drivers -> Serial Driver Support -> Serial Console
         CONFIG_USART4_SERIAL_CONSOLE=y  : Select only one for the console
         CONFIG_USART4_SERIAL_CONSOLE=n

       Device Drivers -> Serial Driver Support -> SERCOM3 Configuration
         CONFIG_USART3_2STOP=0
         CONFIG_USART3_BAUD=115200
         CONFIG_USART3_BITS=8
         CONFIG_USART3_PARITY=0
         CONFIG_USART3_RXBUFSIZE=256
         CONFIG_USART3_TXBUFSIZE=256

       Device Drivers -> Serial Driver Support -> SERCOM4 Configuration
         CONFIG_USART4_2STOP=0
         CONFIG_USART4_BAUD=115200
         CONFIG_USART4_BITS=8
         CONFIG_USART4_PARITY=0
         CONFIG_USART4_RXBUFSIZE=256
         CONFIG_USART4_TXBUFSIZE=256

       Board Selection -> USART4 Connection
         CONFIG_SAMD20_XPLAINED_USART4_EXT1=n : Pick on if USART4 used
         CONFIG_SAMD20_XPLAINED_USART4_EXT2=n
         CONFIG_SAMD20_XPLAINED_USART4_EXT3=y

  3. Unless otherwise stated, the configurations are setup for
     Cygwin under Windows:

     Build Setup:
       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y   : Windows Host
       CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y : Cygwin environment on windows

  4. These configurations use the GNU EABI toolchain.  But
     that is easily reconfigured:

     System Type -> Toolchain:
       CONFIG_ARMV6M_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y

     Any re-configuration should be done before making NuttX or else the
     subsequent 'make' will fail.  If you have already attempted building
     NuttX then you will have to 1) 'make distclean' to remove the old
     configuration, 2) 'tools/configure.sh sam3u-ek/ksnh' to start
     with a fresh configuration, and 3) perform the configuration changes
     above.

     Also, make sure that your PATH variable has the new path to your
     Atmel tools.  Try 'which arm-none-eabi-gcc' to make sure that you
     are selecting the right tool.

     See also the "NOTE about Windows native toolchains" in the section
     called "GNU Toolchain Options" above.

Configuration sub-directories
-----------------------------

  nsh:
    This configuration directory will built the NuttShell.  See NOTES above
    and below:

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration is set up to build on Windows using the Cygwin
       environment using the ARM EABI toolchain.  This can be easily
       changed as described above under "Configurations."

    2. By default, this configuration provides a serial console on SERCOM4
       at 115200 8N1 via EXT3:

       PIN   EXT3 GPIO Function
       ----  ---- ------------------
        13   PB11 SERCOM4 / USART RX
        14   PB12 SERCOM4 / USART TX
        19   GND  N/A
        20   VCC  N/A

       If you would prefer to use the EDBG serial COM port or would prefer
       to use SERCOM4 on EXT1 or EXT2, you will need to reconfigure the
       SERCOM as described under "Configurations".  See also the section
       entitled "Serial Consoles" above.

    3. NOTE: If you get a compilation error like:

         libxx_new.cxx:74:40: error: 'operator new' takes type 'size_t'
                              ('unsigned int') as first parameter [-fper

       Sometimes NuttX and your toolchain will disagree on the underlying
       type of size_t; sometimes it is an 'unsigned int' and sometimes it is
       an 'unsigned long int'.  If this error occurs, then you may need to
       toggle the value of CONFIG_ARCH_SIZET_LONG.

    4. If the I/O1 module is connected to the SAMD20 Xplained Pro, then
       support for the SD card slot can be enabled by making the following
       changes to the configuration.  These changes assume that the I/O1
       modules is connected in EXT1.  Most of the modifications necessary
       to work with the I/O1 in a different connector are obvious.. except
       for the selection of SERCOM SPI support:

         EXT1: SPI is provided through SERCOM0
         EXT2: SPI is provided through SERCOM1
         EXT3: SPI is provided through SERCOM5

       File Systems:
         CONFIG_FS_FAT=y                   : Enable the FAT file system
         CONFIG_FAT_LCNAMES=y              : Enable upper/lower case 8.3 file names (Optional, see below)
         CONFIG_FAT_LFN=y                  : Enable long file named (Optional, see below)
         CONFIG_FAT_MAXFNAME=32            : Maximum supported file name length

         There are issues related to patents that Microsoft holds on FAT long
         file name technologies.  See the top level COPYING file for further
         details.

       System Type -> Peripherals:
         CONFIG_SAMD2L2_SERCOM0=y          : Use SERCOM0 if the I/O is in EXT1
         CONFIG_SAMD2L2_SERCOM0_ISSPI=y    : Configure SERCOM0 as an SPI master

       Device Drivers
         CONFIG_SPI=y                      : Enable SPI support
         CONFIG_SPI_EXCHANGE=y             : The exchange() method is supported

         CONFIG_MMCSD=y                    : Enable MMC/SD support
         CONFIG_MMCSD_NSLOTS=1             : Only one MMC/SD card slot
         CONFIG_MMCSD_MULTIBLOCK_DISABLE=n : Should not need to disable multi-block transfers
         CONFIG_MMCSD_MMCSUPPORT=n         : May interfere with some SD cards
         CONFIG_MMCSD_HAVE_CARDDETECT=y     : I/O1 module as a card detect GPIO
         CONFIG_MMCSD_SPI=y                : Use the SPI interface to the MMC/SD card
         CONFIG_MMCSD_SPICLOCK=20000000    : This is a guess for the optimal MMC/SD frequency
         CONFIG_MMCSD_SPIMODE=0            : Mode 0 is required

       Board Selection -> Common Board Options
         CONFIG_NSH_MMCSDSLOTNO=0          : Only one MMC/SD slot, slot 0
         CONFIG_NSH_MMCSDSPIPORTNO=0       : Use port=0 -> SERCOM0 if the I/O1 is in EXT1

       Board Selection -> SAMD20 Xplained Pro Modules
         CONFIG_SAMD20_XPLAINED_IOMODULE=y      : I/O1 module is connected
         CONFIG_SAMD20_XPLAINED_IOMODULE_EXT1=y : I/O1 modules is in EXT1

       Application Configuration -> NSH Library
         CONFIG_NSH_ARCHINIT=y             : Board has architecture-specific initialization

       NOTE: If you enable the I/O1 this configuration with SERCOM4 as the
       console and with the I/O1 module in EXT1, you *must* remove USART
       jumper.  Otherwise, you have lookpack on SERCOM4 and NSH will *not*
       behave very well (since its outgoing prompts also appear as incoming
       commands).

       STATUS:  As of 2013-6-18, this configuration appears completely
       functional.  Testing, however, has been very light.  Example:

         NuttShell (NSH) NuttX-6.34
         nsh> mount -t vfat /dev/mmcsd0 /mnt/stuff
         nsh> ls /mnt/stuff
         /mnt/stuff:
         nsh> echo "This is a test" >/mnt/stuff/atest.txt
         nsh> ls /mnt/stuff
         /mnt/stuff:
          atest.txt
         nsh> cat /mnt/stuff/atest.txt
         This is a test
         nsh>

    5. If the OLED1 module is connected to the SAMD20 Xplained Pro, then
       support for the OLED display can be enabled by making the following
       changes to the configuration.  These changes assume that the I/O1
       modules is connected in EXT1.  Most of the modifications necessary
       to work with the I/O1 in a different connector are obvious.. except
       for the selection of SERCOM SPI support:

         EXT1: SPI is provided through SERCOM0
         EXT2: SPI is provided through SERCOM1
         EXT3: SPI is provided through SERCOM5

       System Type -> Peripherals:
         CONFIG_SAMD2L2_SERCOM1=y           : Use SERCOM1 if the I/O is in EXT2
         CONFIG_SAMD2L2_SERCOM1_ISSPI=y     : Configure SERCOM1 as an SPI master

       Device Drivers -> SPI
         CONFIG_SPI=y                       : Enable SPI support
         CONFIG_SPI_EXCHANGE=y              : The exchange() method is supported
         CONFIG_SPI_CMDDATA=y               : CMD/DATA support is required

       Device Drivers -> LCDs
         CONFIG_LCD=y                       : Enable LCD support
         CONFIG_LCD_MAXCONTRAST=255         : Maximum contrast value
         CONFIG_LCD_LANDSCAPE=y             : Landscape orientation (see below*)
         CONFIG_LCD_UG2832HSWEG04=y         : Enable support for the OLED
         CONFIG_LCD_SSD1306_SPIMODE=0       : SPI Mode 0
         CONFIG_LCD_SSD1306_SPIMODE=3500000 : Pick an SPI frequency

       Board Selection -> SAMD20 Xplained Pro Modules
         CONFIG_SAMD20_XPLAINED_OLED1MODULE=y      : OLED1 module is connected
         CONFIG_SAMD20_XPLAINED_OLED1MODULE_EXT2=y : OLED1 modules is in EXT2

       The NX graphics subsystem also needs to be configured:

         CONFIG_NX=y                        : Enable graphics support
         CONFIG_NX_LCDDRIVER=y              : Using an LCD driver
         CONFIG_NX_NPLANES=1                : With a single color plane
         CONFIG_NX_WRITEONLY=n              : You can read from the LCD (see below**)
         CONFIG_NX_DISABLE_2BPP=y           : Disable all resolutions except 1BPP
         CONFIG_NX_DISABLE_4BPP=y
         CONFIG_NX_DISABLE_8BPP=y
         CONFIG_NX_DISABLE_16BPP=y
         CONFIG_NX_DISABLE_24BPP=y
         CONFIG_NX_DISABLE_32BPP=y
         CONFIG_NX_PACKEDMSFIRST=y          : LSB packed first (shouldn't matter)
         CONFIG_NXSTART_EXTERNINIT=y        : We have board_graphics_setup()
         CONFIG_NXTK_BORDERWIDTH=2          : Use a small border
         CONFIG_NXTK_DEFAULT_BORDERCOLORS=y : Default border colors
         CONFIG_NXFONTS_CHARBITS=7          : 7-bit fonts
         CONFIG_NXFONT_SANS17X23B=y         : Pick a font (any that will fit)

        * This orientation will put the buttons "above" the LCD.  The
          reverse landscape configuration (CONFIG_LCD_RLANDSCAPE) will
          "flip" the display so that the buttons are "below" the LCD.

       ** The hardware is write only, but the driver maintains a frame buffer
          to support read and read-write-modiry operations on the LCD.
          Reading from the frame buffer is, however, untested.

       Then, in order to use the OLED, you will need to build some kind of
       graphics application or use one of the NuttX graphics examples.
       Here, for example, is the setup for the graphic "Hello, World!"
       example:

         CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NXHELLO=y                : Enables the example
         CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NXHELLO_DEFAULT_COLORS=y : Use default colors (see below *)
         CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NXHELLO_DEFAULT_FONT=y   : Use the default font
         CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NXHELLO_BPP=1            : One bit per pixel
         CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NXHELLO_EXTERNINIT=y     : Special initialization is required.

        * The OLED is monochrome so the only "colors" are blacka nd white.
          The default "colors" will give you while text on a black background.
          You can override the faults it you want black text on a while background.

       NOTE:  One issue that I have seen with the NXHello example when
       running as an NSH command is that it only works the first time.
       So, after you run the 'nxhello' command one time, you will have to
       reset the board before you run it again.

       This is clearly some issue with initializing, un-initializing, and
       then re-initializing. If you want to fix this, patches are quite
       welcome.
