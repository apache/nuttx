/* There are three LEDs on board the SAMD21 Xplained Pro board:  The EDBG
 * controls two of the LEDs, a power LED and a status LED.  There is only
 * one user controllable LED, a yellow LED labelled STATUS near the SAMD21 USB
 * connector.
 *
 * This LED is controlled by PB30 and the LED can be activated by driving PB30
 * to GND.
 *
 * When CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is defined in the NuttX configuration, NuttX will
 * control the LED as follows:
 *
 *   SYMBOL              Meaning                 LED
 *   ------------------- ----------------------- ------
 *   LED_STARTED         NuttX has been started  OFF
 *   LED_HEAPALLOCATE    Heap has been allocated OFF
 *   LED_IRQSENABLED     Interrupts enabled      OFF
 *   LED_STACKCREATED    Idle stack created      ON
 *   LED_INIRQ           In an interrupt**       N/C
 *   LED_SIGNAL          In a signal handler***  N/C
 *   LED_ASSERTION       An assertion failed     N/C
 *   LED_PANIC           The system has crashed  FLASH
 *
 * Thus if the LED is statically on, NuttX has successfully  booted and is,
 * apparently, running normally.  If the LED is flashing at approximately
 * 2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system has halted.
