/* There are three LEDs on board the SAML21 Xplained Pro board:  The EDBG
 * controls two of the LEDs, a power LED and a status LED.  There is only
 * one user controllable LED, a yellow LED labeled STATUS near the SAML21 USB
 * connector.
 *
 * This LED is controlled by PB10 and the LED can be activated by driving
 * PB10 to GND.
 *
 * When CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is defined in the NuttX configuration, NuttX will
 * control the LED.
 * Otherwise, the LED can be controlled from user applications using the
 * logic in this file.
