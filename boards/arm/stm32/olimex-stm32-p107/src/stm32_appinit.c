/****************************************************************************
 * Name: board_app_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   Perform application specific initialization.  This function is never
 *   called directly from application code, but only indirectly via the
 *   (non-standard) boardctl() interface using the command BOARDIOC_INIT.
 *
 *   CONFIG_LIB_BOARDCTL=y:
 *     If CONFIG_NSH_ARCHINITIALIZE=y:
 *       Called from the NSH library (or other application)
 *     Otherse, assumed to be called from some other application.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   arg - The boardctl() argument is passed to the board_app_initialize()
 *         implementation without modification.  The argument has no
 *         meaning to NuttX; the meaning of the argument is a contract
 *         between the board-specific initialization logic and the
 *         matching application logic.  The value could be such things as a
 *         mode enumeration value, a set of DIP switch switch settings, a
 *         pointer to configuration data read from a file or serial FLASH,
 *         or whatever you would like to do with it.  Every implementation
 *         should accept zero/NULL as a default configuration.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success; a negated errno value is returned on
 *   any failure to indicate the nature of the failure.
 *
