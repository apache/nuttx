The NuttX configuration for the Olimex STM32-P207 is assembled mainly
from the configurations stm32f4discovery and stm3240g-eval.

It was tested with the NuttX EABI "buildroot" Toolchain.

Debugging with OpenOCD via an Olimex ARM-USB-TINY-H works. Note that
CONFIG_DEBUG_SYMBOLS and CONFIG_STM32_DISABLE_IDLE_SLEEP_DURING_DEBUG
are enabled so that the JTAG connection is not disconnected by the idle
loop.

The following peripherals are enabled in this configuration.

 - LEDs:       show the system status

 - Buttons:    TAMPER-button, WKUP-button, J1-Joystick (consists of RIGHT-,
               UP-, LEFT-, DOWN-, and CENTER-button). Built in app
               'buttons' works.

 - ADC:        ADC1 samples the red trim potentiometer AN_TR
               Built in app 'adc' works.

 - USB-FS-OTG: Enabled but not really tested, since there is only a
               USB-A-connector (host) connected to the full speed STM32
               inputs.

 - USB-HS_OTG: The other connector (device) is connected to the high speed
               STM32 inputs (not enabled).

 - CAN:        Built in app 'can' works, but apart from that not really tested.

 - Ethernet:   Ping to other station on the network works.
