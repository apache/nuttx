ST Bootloader
=============

  A bootloader code is available in an internal boot ROM memory (called
  'system memory' in STM documentation) in all STM32 MCUs. For the F103xx
  this bootloader can be used to upload & flash a firmware image through
  the USART1.

  Notes:

  - The bootloader is activated by the BOOT0 / BOOT1 pins after a MCU reset.
    See STM application note 2606 for more details.
  - On the hymini-stm32 board the USART1 is connected to a PL2303
    USB<->serial converter.

  To enter bootloader mode in the hymini-stm32 board:

  - Press the 'boot0' button  (located next to 'reset' button)
  - While boot0 button is pressed, reset the board through the reset button.
  - Once you pressed / released the 'reset' button, the MCU has (re)started
    in bootloader mode (and you can then release the boot0 button).

  A flash utility must be used on your development workstation to upload / flash
  a firmware image. (The 'stm32flash' open source tool, available at
  http://stm32flash.googlecode.com/ has been used successfully).

LEDs
====

The HY-MiniSTM32 board provides only two controllable LEDs labeled LED1 and LED2.
Usage of these LEDs is defined in include/board.h and src/up_leds.c.
They are encoded as follows:

    SYMBOL              Meaning                 LED1*   LED2
    ------------------- ----------------------- ------- -------
    LED_STARTED         NuttX has been started  OFF     OFF
    LED_HEAPALLOCATE    Heap has been allocated ON      OFF
    LED_IRQSENABLED     Interrupts enabled      OFF     ON
    LED_STACKCREATED    Idle stack created      ON      OFF
    LED_INIRQ           In an interrupt**       OFF     N/C
    LED_SIGNAL          In a signal handler***  N/C     ON
    LED_ASSERTION       An assertion failed     ON      ON
    LED_PANIC           The system has crashed  BLINK   BLINK
    LED_IDLE            STM32 is is sleep mode  (Optional, not used)

  * If NuttX starts correctly, normal state is to have LED1 on and LED2 off.
 ** LED1 is turned off during interrupt.
*** LED2 is turned on during signal handler.

RTC
===

  The STM32 RTC may configured using the following settings.

    CONFIG_RTC - Enables general support for a hardware RTC. Specific
      architectures may require other specific settings.
    CONFIG_RTC_HIRES - The typical RTC keeps time to resolution of 1
      second, usually supporting a 32-bit time_t value.  In this case,
      the RTC is used to &quot;seed&quot; the normal NuttX timer and the
      NuttX timer provides for higher resolution time. If CONFIG_RTC_HIRES
      is enabled in the NuttX configuration, then the RTC provides higher
      resolution time and completely replaces the system timer for purpose of
      date and time.
      CONFIG_RTC_FREQUENCY - If CONFIG_RTC_HIRES is defined, then the
      frequency of the high resolution RTC must be provided.  If CONFIG_RTC_HIRES
      is not defined, CONFIG_RTC_FREQUENCY is assumed to be one.
    CONFIG_RTC_ALARM - Enable if the RTC hardware supports setting of an alarm.
      A callback function will be executed when the alarm goes off

  In hi-res mode, the STM32 RTC operates only at 16384Hz.  Overflow interrupts
  are handled when the 32-bit RTC counter overflows every 3 days and 43 minutes.
  A BKP register is incremented on each overflow interrupt creating, effectively,
  a 48-bit RTC counter.

  In the lo-res mode, the RTC operates at 1Hz.  Overflow interrupts are not handled
  (because the next overflow is not expected until the year 2106.

   WARNING:  Overflow interrupts are lost whenever the STM32 is powered down.  The
   overflow interrupt may be lost even if the STM32 is powered down only momentarily.
   Therefore hi-res solution is only useful in systems where the power is always on.

  Timer and I2C devices may need to the following to force power to be applied
  unconditionally at power up.  (Otherwise, the device is powered when it is
  initialized).

    CONFIG_STM32_FORCEPOWER

  The Timer3 alternate mapping is required for PWM control of LCD backlight

    CONFIG_STM32_TIM3_PARTIAL_REMAP=y

  Timer devices may be used for different purposes.  One special purpose is
  to generate modulated outputs for such things as motor control.  If CONFIG_STM32_TIMn
  is defined (as above) then the following may also be defined to indicate that
  the timer is intended to be used for pulsed output modulation, ADC conversion,
  or DAC conversion.  Note that ADC/DAC require two definition:  Not only do you have
  to assign the timer (n) for used by the ADC or DAC, but then you also have to
  configure which ADC or DAC (m) it is assigned to.

    CONFIG_STM32_TIMn_PWM   Reserve timer n for use by PWM, n=1,..,8
    CONFIG_STM32_TIMn_ADC   Reserve timer n for use by ADC, n=1,..,8

Configurations
==============

NOTES:

  - All configurations described below are using the mconf-based
    configuration tool.  To change their configuration using that tool, you
    should:

    a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
       see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

    b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
       reconfiguration process.

  - All configurations use a generic GNU EABI toolchain for Linux by
    default.

  - They are all configured to generate a binary image that can be flashed
    through the STM32 internal bootloader.

Each HY-MiniSTM32V configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
can be selected as follow:

    tools/configure.sh hymini-stm32v:<subdir>

Where <subdir> is one of the following:

  nsh and nsh2:

    (1) You will probably need to the PATH environment variable to set
        up the correct PATH variable for whichever toolchain you may use.
    (2) When any other device other than /dev/console is used for a user
        interface, (1) linefeeds (\n) will not be expanded to carriage return
        / linefeeds \r\n). You will need to configure your terminal program
        to account for this. And (2) input is not automatically echoed so
        you will have to turn local echo on.
    (3) Microsoft holds several patents related to the design of
        long file names in the FAT file system.  Please refer to the
        details in the top-level NOTICE file.  Please do not use FAT
        long file name unless you are familiar with these patent issues.
    (4) When built as an NSH add-on command (CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS=y),
        Caution should be used to assure that the SD drive is not in use when
        the USB storage device is configured.  Specifically, the SD driver
        should be unmounted like:

        nsh> mount -t vfat /dev/mmcsd0 /mnt/sdcard # Card is mounted in NSH
        ...
        nsh> umount /mnd/sdcard                    # Unmount before connecting USB!!!
        nsh> msconn                                # Connect the USB storage device
        ...
        nsh> msdis                                 # Disconnect USB storate device
        nsh> mount -t vfat /dev/mmcsd0 /mnt/sdcard # Restore the mount

        Failure to do this could result in corruption of the SD card format.
    (5) Option CONFIG_NSH_ARCHINIT must be enabled in order to call the SDIO slot
        initialization code.

  usbmsc:
  -------

    This configuration directory exercises the USB mass storage
    class driver at system/usbmsc.  See examples/README.txt for
    more information.

  usbnsh:
  -------

    This is another NSH example.  If differs from other 'nsh' configurations
    in that this configurations uses a USB serial device for console I/O.

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration does have UART2 output enabled and set up as
       the system logging device:

       CONFIG_SYSLOG_CHAR=y               : Use a character device for system logging
       CONFIG_SYSLOG_DEVPATH="/dev/ttyS0" : UART2 will be /dev/ttyS0

       However, there is nothing to generate SYSLOG output in the default
       configuration so nothing should appear on UART2 unless you enable
       some debug output or enable the USB monitor.

    2. Enabling USB monitor SYSLOG output.  If tracing is enabled, the USB
       device will save encoded trace output in in-memory buffer; if the
       USB monitor is enabled, that trace buffer will be periodically
       emptied and dumped to the system logging device (UART2 in this
       configuration):

       CONFIG_USBDEV_TRACE=y                   : Enable USB trace feature
       CONFIG_USBDEV_TRACE_NRECORDS=128        : Buffer 128 records in memory
       CONFIG_NSH_USBDEV_TRACE=n               : No builtin tracing from NSH
       CONFIG_NSH_ARCHINIT=y                   : Automatically start the USB monitor
       CONFIG_USBMONITOR=y              : Enable the USB monitor daemon
       CONFIG_USBMONITOR_STACKSIZE=2048 : USB monitor daemon stack size
       CONFIG_USBMONITOR_PRIORITY=50    : USB monitor daemon priority
       CONFIG_USBMONITOR_INTERVAL=2     : Dump trace data every 2 seconds

       CONFIG_USBMONITOR_TRACEINIT=y    : Enable TRACE output
       CONFIG_USBMONITOR_TRACECLASS=y
       CONFIG_USBMONITOR_TRACETRANSFERS=y
       CONFIG_USBMONITOR_TRACECONTROLLER=y
       CONFIG_USBMONITOR_TRACEINTERRUPTS=y

    Using the Prolifics PL2303 Emulation
    ------------------------------------
    You could also use the non-standard PL2303 serial device instead of
    the standard CDC/ACM serial device by changing:

      CONFIG_CDCACM=y               : Disable the CDC/ACM serial device class
      CONFIG_CDCACM_CONSOLE=y       : The CDC/ACM serial device is NOT the console
      CONFIG_PL2303=y               : The Prolifics PL2303 emulation is enabled
      CONFIG_PL2303_CONSOLE=y       : The PL2303 serial device is the console

  usbserial:
  ---------
    This configuration directory exercises the USB serial class
    driver at examples/usbserial.  See examples/README.txt for
    more information.

      CONFIG_HOST_LINUX=y                      : Linux host
      CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIL=y      : GNU EABI toolchain for Linux

    USB debug output can be enabled as by changing the following
    settings in the configuration file:

      -CONFIG_DEBUG_FEATURES=n
      -CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=n
      -CONFIG_DEBUG_USB=n
      +CONFIG_DEBUG_FEATURES=y
      +CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y
      +CONFIG_DEBUG_USB=y

      -CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBSERIAL_TRACEINIT=n
      -CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBSERIAL_TRACECLASS=n
      -CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBSERIAL_TRACETRANSFERS=n
      -CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBSERIAL_TRACECONTROLLER=n
      -CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBSERIAL_TRACEINTERRUPTS=n
      +CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBSERIAL_TRACEINIT=y
      +CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBSERIAL_TRACECLASS=y
      +CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBSERIAL_TRACETRANSFERS=y
      +CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBSERIAL_TRACECONTROLLER=y
      +CONFIG_EXAMPLES_USBSERIAL_TRACEINTERRUPTS=y

    By default, the usbserial example uses the Prolific PL2303
    serial/USB converter emulation.  The example can be modified
    serial/USB converter emulation.  The example can be modified
    to use the CDC/ACM serial class by making the following changes
    to the configuration file:

      -CONFIG_PL2303=y
      +CONFIG_PL2303=n

      -CONFIG_CDCACM=n
      +CONFIG_CDCACM=y
