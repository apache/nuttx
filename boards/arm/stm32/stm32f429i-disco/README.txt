README
======

This README discusses issues unique to NuttX configurations for the
STMicro STM32F429I-DISCO development board featuring the STM32F429ZIT6
MCU. The STM32F429ZIT6 is a 180MHz Cortex-M4 operation with 2Mbit Flash
memory and 256kbytes. The board features:

  - On-board ST-LINK/V2 for programming and debugging,
  - On-board 64 Mbits (8 Mbytes) External SDRAM (1 Mbit x 16-bit x 4-bank)
  - L3GD20, ST MEMS motion sensor, 3-axis digital output gyroscope,
  - TFT 2.4" LCD, 262K color RGB, 240 x 320 pixels
  - Touchscreen controller
  - Two user LEDs and two push-buttons,
  - USB OTG FS with micro-AB connector, and
  - Easy access to most MCU pins.

NOTE:  Includes basic NSH command support with full 8MByte SDRAM + the
       internal 256K.  Unsupported are the LCD and USB interfaces.

       The board pin configuration to support on-board SDRAM and LCD
       prevents use of the OTG FS module which is normally used for USB
       NSH sessions.  Instead, the board routes the OTG HS pins to the
       USB OTG connector.

       The NSH configuration / testing that has been done so far was
       performed by connecting an external RS-232 line driver to pins
       PA9 (TX) and PA10 (RX) and configuring USART1 as the NSH console.

Refer to the http://www.st.com website for further information about this
board (search keyword: 429i-disco)

NOTE:  This port was based on the original discovery kit, STM32F429I-DISCO.
That board has been superseded by the new STM32F429I-DISC1.

Development Environment
=======================

The Development environments for the STM32F429I-DISCO board are identical
to the environments for other STM32F boards.  For full details on the
environment options and setup, see the README.txt file in the
boards/arm/stm32/stm32f4discovery directory.

Setup and Programming Flash
===========================

I use a USB cable to power and program it.  And I use a USB/Serial
connected to pins PA9 and PA10 for the serial console (See the section
"UARTs" below).

FLASH may be programmed:

  - Via USB using STM32 ST-Link Utility

  - Via USB using OpenOCD.  This command may be used to flash the
    firmware using OpenOCD:

    $ sudo openocd -f interface/stlink-v2.cfg -f target/stm32f4x.cfg -c init -c "reset halt" -c "flash write_image erase nuttx.bin 0x08000000"

  - Via JTAG/SWD connected to the SWD connector CN2.

    CN4 Jumpers.  Remove jumpers to enable signals at SWD connector CN2.

    should also be connected to ground in the target system.

LEDs
====

The STM32F429I-DISCO board has two user LEDs; green, and red on the board.
These LEDs are not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
include/board.h and src/up_leds.c. The LEDs are used to encode OS-related
events as follows:

  SYMBOL                Meaning                 LED1*    LED2
                                                green    red
  -------------------  -----------------------  -------  -------
  LED_STARTED          NuttX has been started   ON       OFF
  LED_HEAPALLOCATE     Heap has been allocated  OFF      ON
  LED_IRQSENABLED      Interrupts enabled       ON       ON
  LED_STACKCREATED     Idle stack created       OFF      ON
  LED_INIRQ            In an interrupt**        ON       ON
  LED_SIGNAL           In a signal handler      N/C      ON
  LED_ASSERTION        An assertion failed      ON       ON
  LED_PANIC            The system has crashed   ON       BLINK
  LED_IDLE             STM32 is is sleep mode   (Optional, not used)

  * In normal mode, LED1 will be on and LED2 might flicker a bit as IRQs
    and SIGNALS are processed.
  * If LED1 is on and LED2 is blinking, then NuttX probably failed to boot
    or is in a PANIC condition.

UARTs
=====

On the STM32F429I-DISCO board, because of pin mappings to support the
onboard SDRAM and LCD, the only UARTs that have both RX and TX pins
available are USART1 and UART5.  Other USARTS could be used for RX or TX
only, or they could be used for full-duplex if the other pin functions
aren't being used (i.e. LCD or SDRAM).

Default Serial Console
----------------------

USART1 is enabled as the serial console in all configurations (see */defconfig).
USART1 RX and TX are configured on pins PA10 and PA9, respectively (see
include/board.h).

   free I/O pins (This need to be updated.  They are incorrect!)
** Port I pins are not supported by the MCU

FPU
===

FPU Configuration Options
-------------------------

There are two version of the FPU support built into the STM32 port.

1. Non-Lazy Floating Point Register Save

   In this configuration floating point register save and restore is
   implemented on interrupt entry and return, respectively.  In this
   case, you may use floating point operations for interrupt handling
   logic if necessary.  This FPU behavior logic is enabled by default
   with:

     CONFIG_ARCH_FPU=y

2. Lazy Floating Point Register Save.

   An alternative implementation only saves and restores FPU registers only
   on context switches.  This means: (1) floating point registers are not
   stored on each context switch and, hence, possibly better interrupt
   performance.  But, (2) since floating point registers are not saved,
   you cannot use floating point operations within interrupt handlers.

   This logic can be enabled by simply adding the following to your .config
   file:

     CONFIG_ARCH_FPU=y
     CONFIG_ARMV7M_LAZYFPU=y

CFLAGS
------

Only recent GCC toolchains have built-in support for the Cortex-M4 FPU.  You will see
the following lines in each Make.defs file:

  ifeq ($(CONFIG_ARCH_FPU),y)
    ARCHCPUFLAGS = -mcpu=cortex-m4 -mthumb -march=armv7e-m -mfpu=fpv4-sp-d16 -mfloat-abi=hard
  else
    ARCHCPUFLAGS = -mcpu=cortex-m3 -mthumb -mfloat-abi=soft
  endif

FMC SDRAM
=========

On-board SDRAM
--------------
The STM32F429I-DISCO has 8 MBytes on-board SDRAM connected to the MCU's
SDRAM Bank 2 connections (Bank 6 of the FMC).  This means the 8 MiB
(when enabled) is mapped to address 0xD0000000-0xD07FFFFF.  The port for
the STM32F429I-DISCO board includes support for using the onboard 8M SDRAM.

Configuration Options
---------------------
Internal SRAM is available in all members of the STM32 family. The F4 family
also contains internal CCM SRAM.  This SRAM is different because it cannot
be used for DMA.  So if DMA needed, then the following should be defined
to exclude CCM SRAM from the heap:

  CONFIG_STM32_CCMEXCLUDE    : Exclude CCM SRAM from the HEAP

In addition to internal SRAM, SRAM may also be available through the FMC.
In order to use FMC SDRAM, the following additional things need to be
present in the NuttX configuration file:

  CONFIG_STM32_FMC=y          : Enables the FMC and the 8MiB SDRAM
  CONFIG_STM32_EXTERNAL_RAM=y : Indicates that RAM is available via the
                                FMC (as opposed to an LCD or FLASH).
  CONFIG_HEAP2_BASE           : The base address of the RAM in the FMC
                                address space.  This should be 0xD0000000.
  CONFIG_HEAP2_SIZE           : The size of the RAM in the FMC
                                address space.  This should be 8388608.
  CONFIG_MM_REGIONS           : Must be set to a large enough value to
                                include the FMC SDRAM (1, 2 or 3 depending
                                if the CCM RAM and/or FMC SDRAM are enabled).

SRAM Configurations
--------------------
There are 4 possible SRAM configurations:

  Configuration 1. System SRAM (only)
                   CONFIG_MM_REGIONS == 1
                   CONFIG_STM32_EXTERNAL_RAM NOT defined
                   CONFIG_STM32_CCMEXCLUDE defined
  Configuration 2. System SRAM and CCM SRAM
                   CONFIG_MM_REGIONS == 2
                   CONFIG_STM32_EXTERNAL_RAM NOT defined
                   CONFIG_STM32_CCMEXCLUDE NOT defined
  Configuration 3. System SRAM and FMC SDRAM
                   CONFIG_MM_REGIONS == 2
                   CONFIG_STM32_EXTERNAL_RAM defined
                   CONFIG_STM32_CCMEXCLUDE defined
  Configuration 4. System SRAM, CCM SRAM, and FMC SDRAM
                   CONFIG_MM_REGIONS == 3
                   CONFIG_STM32_EXTERNAL_RAM defined
                   CONFIG_STM32_CCMEXCLUDE NOT defined

  Timer devices may be used for different purposes.  One special purpose is
  to generate modulated outputs for such things as motor control.  If CONFIG_STM32_TIMn
  is defined (as above) then the following may also be defined to indicate that
  the timer is intended to be used for pulsed output modulation, ADC conversion,
  or DAC conversion. Note that ADC/DAC require two definition:  Not only do you have
  to assign the timer (n) for used by the ADC or DAC, but then you also have to
  configure which ADC or DAC (m) it is assigned to.

    CONFIG_STM32_TIMn_PWM   Reserve timer n for use by PWM, n=1,..,14
    CONFIG_STM32_TIMn_ADC   Reserve timer n for use by ADC, n=1,..,14
    CONFIG_STM32_TIMn_ADCm  Reserve timer n to trigger ADCm, n=1,..,14, m=1,..,3
    CONFIG_STM32_TIMn_DAC   Reserve timer n for use by DAC, n=1,..,14
    CONFIG_STM32_TIMn_DACm  Reserve timer n to trigger DACm, n=1,..,14, m=1,..,2

  For each timer that is enabled for PWM usage, we need the following additional
  configuration settings:

    CONFIG_STM32_TIMx_CHANNEL - Specifies the timer output channel {1,..,4}

  NOTE: The STM32 timers are each capable of generating different signals on
  each of the four channels with different duty cycles.  That capability is
  not supported by this driver:  Only one output channel per timer.

  JTAG Enable settings (by default only SW-DP is enabled):

    CONFIG_STM32_JTAG_FULL_ENABLE - Enables full SWJ (JTAG-DP + SW-DP)
    CONFIG_STM32_JTAG_NOJNTRST_ENABLE - Enables full SWJ (JTAG-DP + SW-DP)
      but without JNTRST.
    CONFIG_STM32_JTAG_SW_ENABLE - Set JTAG-DP disabled and SW-DP enabled

  STM32F429I-DISCO specific device driver settings

    CONFIG_U[S]ARTn_SERIAL_CONSOLE - selects the USARTn (n=1,2,3) or UART
           m (m=4,5) for the console and ttys0 (default is the USART1).

       This specific the size of the receive buffer
    CONFIG_U[S]ARTn_TXBUFSIZE - Characters are buffered before
       being sent.  This specific the size of the transmit buffer

    CONFIG_CAN - Enables CAN support (one or both of CONFIG_STM32_CAN1 or
      CONFIG_STM32_CAN2 must also be defined)
    CONFIG_CAN_EXTID - Enables support for the 29-bit extended ID.  Default
      Standard 11-bit IDs.
    CONFIG_CAN_FIFOSIZE - The size of the circular buffer of CAN messages.
      Default: 8
    CONFIG_CAN_NPENDINGRTR - The size of the list of pending RTR requests.
      Default: 4
    CONFIG_CAN_LOOPBACK - A CAN driver may or may not support a loopback
      mode for testing. The STM32 CAN driver does support loopback mode.

Configurations
==============

Each STM32F429I-DISCO configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
can be selected as follow:

    tools/configure.sh stm32f429i-disco:<subdir>

Where <subdir> is one of the following:

  extflash:
  ---------

    This is another NSH example.  If differs from other 'nsh' configurations
    in that this configuration defines an external 8 MByte SPI FLASH (the
    SST25VF064C part from Silicon Storage Technology, Inc.) which must be
    be connected to the Discovery board's SPI4 pins on the expansion pins.
    Additionally, this demo uses UART1 for the console

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration assumes an SST25VF064C 8Mbyte SPI FLASH is
       connected to SPI4 on the following Discovery board Pins:

         SCK:   Port PE2   Board Connector P1, Pin 15
         MOSI:  Port PE6   Board Connector P1, Pin 11
         MISO:  Port PE5   Board Connector P1, Pin 14
         CS:    Port PE4   Board Connector P1, Pin 13

    2. This configuration does have UART1 output enabled and set up as
       the system logging device.  To use this UART, you must add an
       external RS-232 line driver to the UART1 pins of the DISCO board
       on PA9 and PA10 of connector P1.

    STM32F429I-DISCO LTDC Framebuffer demo example.  This is a simple
    configuration used for some basic (non-graphic) debug of the framebuffer
    character drivers using apps/examples/fb.  It simply opens the framebuffer
    device and draws concentric rectangles of different colors in the
    framebuffer:

      nsh> fb

    Also included is the touchscreen test of apps/examples/touchscreen.  This
    example will simply open the touchscreen driver then collect and display
    touch inputs:

      nsh> tc 1
      tc_main: nsamples: 1
      tc_main: Initializing external touchscreen device
      tc_main: Opening /dev/input0
      Sample     :
         npoints : 1
      Point 1    :
              id : 0
           flags : 3c
               x : 2296
               y : 2311
               h : 0
               w : 0
        pressure : 1
      Terminating!
      nsh>

    STM32F429I-DISCO LittlevGL demo example.

    The ltdc is initialized during boot up.  Interaction with NSH is via
    the serial console at 115200 8N1 baud.  From the nsh command line
    execute the lvgldemo example:

      nsh> lvgldemo

    The test will execute the calibration process and then run the
    LittlevGL demo project.

  nsh:
  ---
    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at apps/examples/nsh.  The
    Configuration enables the serial interfaces on UART2.  Support for
    builtin applications is enabled, but in the base configuration no
    builtin applications are selected (see NOTES below).

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
       change this configuration using that tool, you should:

       a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
          see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

       b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.

    2. By default, this configuration uses the ARM EABI toolchain
       for Windows and builds under Cygwin (or probably MSYS).  That
       can easily be reconfigured, of course.

       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y                   : Builds under Windows
       CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y                 : Using Cygwin
       CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y     : GNU EABI toolchain for Windows

    3. This example supports the PWM test (apps/examples/pwm) but this must
       be manually enabled by selecting:

       CONFIG_PWM=y              : Enable the generic PWM infrastructure
       CONFIG_STM32_TIM4=y       : Enable TIM4
       CONFIG_STM32_TIM4_PWM=y   : Use TIM4 to generate PWM output

       See also apps/examples/README.txt

       Special PWM-only debug options:

       CONFIG_DEBUG_PWM_INFO

    5. This example supports the Quadrature Encode test (apps/examples/qencoder)
       but this must be manually enabled by selecting:

       CONFIG_EXAMPLES_QENCODER=y : Enable the apps/examples/qencoder
       CONFIG_SENSORS=y           : Enable support for sensors
       CONFIG_SENSORS_QENCODER=y          : Enable the generic Quadrature Encoder infrastructure
       CONFIG_STM32_TIM8=y        : Enable TIM8
       CONFIG_STM32_TIM2=n        : (Or optionally TIM2)
       CONFIG_STM32_TIM8_QE=y     : Use TIM8 as the quadrature encoder
       CONFIG_STM32_TIM2_QE=y     : (Or optionally TIM2)

       See also apps/examples/README.txt. Special debug options:

       CONFIG_DEBUG_SENSORS

    6. This example supports the watchdog timer test (apps/examples/watchdog)
       but this must be manually enabled by selecting:

       CONFIG_EXAMPLES_WATCHDOG=y : Enable the apps/examples/watchdog
       CONFIG_WATCHDOG=y          : Enables watchdog timer driver support
       CONFIG_STM32_WWDG=y        : Enables the WWDG timer facility, OR
       CONFIG_STM32_IWDG=y        : Enables the IWDG timer facility (but not both)

       The WWDG watchdog is driven off the (fast) 42MHz PCLK1 and, as result,
       has a maximum timeout value of 49 milliseconds.  for WWDG watchdog, you
       should also add the following to the configuration file:

       CONFIG_EXAMPLES_WATCHDOG_PINGDELAY=20
       CONFIG_EXAMPLES_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT=49

       The IWDG timer has a range of about 35 seconds and should not be an issue.

     7. USB Support (CDC/ACM device)

        CONFIG_STM32_OTGFS=y          : STM32 OTG FS support
        CONFIG_USBDEV=y               : USB device support must be enabled
        CONFIG_CDCACM=y               : The CDC/ACM driver must be built
        CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS=y     : NSH built-in application support must be enabled
        CONFIG_NSH_ARCHINIT=y         : To perform USB initialization

     8. Using the USB console.

        The STM32F429I-DISCO NSH configuration can be set up to use a USB CDC/ACM
        (or PL2303) USB console.  The normal way that you would configure the
        the USB console would be to change the .config file like this:

        CONFIG_STM32_OTGFS=y           : STM32 OTG FS support
        CONFIG_USART2_SERIAL_CONSOLE=n : Disable the USART2 console
        CONFIG_DEV_CONSOLE=n           : Inhibit use of /dev/console by other logic
        CONFIG_USBDEV=y                : USB device support must be enabled
        CONFIG_CDCACM=y                : The CDC/ACM driver must be built
        CONFIG_CDCACM_CONSOLE=y        : Enable the CDC/ACM USB console.

        NOTE: When you first start the USB console, you have hit ENTER a few
        times before NSH starts.  The logic does this to prevent sending USB data
        before there is anything on the host side listening for USB serial input.

    9.  Here is an alternative USB console configuration.  The following
        configuration will also create a NSH USB console but this version
        will use /dev/console.  Instead, it will use the normal /dev/ttyACM0
        USB serial device for the console:

        CONFIG_STM32_OTGFS=y           : STM32 OTG FS support
        CONFIG_USART2_SERIAL_CONSOLE=y : Keep the USART2 console
        CONFIG_DEV_CONSOLE=y           : /dev/console exists (but NSH won't use it)
        CONFIG_USBDEV=y                : USB device support must be enabled
        CONFIG_CDCACM=y                : The CDC/ACM driver must be built
        CONFIG_CDCACM_CONSOLE=n        : Don't use the CDC/ACM USB console.
        CONFIG_NSH_USBCONSOLE=y        : Instead use some other USB device for the console

        The particular USB device that is used is:

        CONFIG_NSH_USBCONDEV="/dev/ttyACM0"

        The advantage of this configuration is only that it is easier to
        bet working.  This alternative does has some side effects:

        - When any other device other than /dev/console is used for a user
          interface, linefeeds (\n) will not be expanded to carriage return /
          linefeeds (\r\n).  You will need to set your terminal program to account
          for this.

        - /dev/console still exists and still refers to the serial port. So
          you can still use certain kinds of debug output (see include/debug.h, all
          debug output from interrupt handlers will be lost.

        - But don't enable USB debug output!  Since USB is console is used for
          USB debug output and you are using a USB console, there will be
          infinite loops and deadlocks:  Debug output generates USB debug
          output which generatates USB debug output, etc.  If you want USB
          debug output, you should consider enabling USB trace
          (CONFIG_USBDEV_TRACE) and perhaps the USB monitor (CONFIG_USBMONITOR).

          See the usbnsh configuration below for more information on configuring
          USB trace output and the USB monitor.

   10. USB OTG FS Host Support.  The following changes will enable support for
       a USB host on the STM32F429I-DISCO, including support for a mass storage
       class driver:

       Device Drivers ->
         CONFIG_USBDEV=n          : Make sure the USB device support is disabled
         CONFIG_USBHOST=y         : Enable USB host support
         CONFIG_USBHOST_ISOC_DISABLE=y

       Device Drivers -> USB Host Driver Support
         CONFIG_USBHOST_MSC=y     : Enable the mass storage class

       System Type -> STM32 Peripheral Support
         CONFIG_STM32_OTGHS=y     : Enable the STM32 USB OTG FH block (FS mode)
         CONFIG_STM32_SYSCFG=y    : Needed for all USB OTF HS support

       RTOS Features -> Work Queue Support
         CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE=y : High priority worker thread support is required
         CONFIG_SCHED_HPWORK=y    :   for the mass storage class driver.

       File Systems ->
         CONFIG_FS_FAT=y          : Needed by the USB host mass storage class.

       Board Selection ->
         CONFIG_BOARDCTL=y    : Needed for CONFIG_NSH_ARCHINIT

       Application Configuration -> NSH Library
         CONFIG_NSH_ARCHINIT=y    : Architecture specific USB initialization
                                  : is needed for NSH

       With those changes, you can use NSH with a FLASH pen driver as shown
       belong.  Here NSH is started with nothing in the USB host slot:

       NuttShell (NSH) NuttX-x.yy
       nsh> ls /dev
       /dev:
        console
        null
        ttyS0

       After inserting the FLASH drive, the /dev/sda appears and can be
       mounted like this:

       nsh> ls /dev
       /dev:
        console
        null
        sda
        ttyS0
       nsh> mount -t vfat /dev/sda /mnt/stuff
       nsh> ls /mnt/stuff
       /mnt/stuff:
        -rw-rw-rw-   16236 filea.c

       And files on the FLASH can be manipulated to standard interfaces:

       nsh> echo "This is a test" >/mnt/stuff/atest.txt
       nsh> ls /mnt/stuff
       /mnt/stuff:
        -rw-rw-rw-   16236 filea.c
        -rw-rw-rw-      16 atest.txt
       nsh> cat /mnt/stuff/atest.txt
       This is a test
       nsh> cp /mnt/stuff/filea.c fileb.c
       nsh> ls /mnt/stuff
       /mnt/stuff:
        -rw-rw-rw-   16236 filea.c
        -rw-rw-rw-      16 atest.txt
        -rw-rw-rw-   16236 fileb.c

       To prevent data loss, don't forget to un-mount the FLASH drive
       before removing it:

       nsh> umount /mnt/stuff

   11. I used this configuration to test the USB hub class.  I did this
       testing with the following changes to the configuration (in addition
       to those listed above for base USB host/mass storage class support):

       Drivers -> USB Host Driver Support
         CONFIG_USBHOST_HUB=y     : Enable the hub class
         CONFIG_USBHOST_ASYNCH=y  : Asynchronous I/O supported needed for hubs

       Board Selection ->
         CONFIG_STM32F429IDISCO_USBHOST_STACKSIZE=2048 (bigger than it needs to be)

       RTOS Features -> Work Queue Support
         CONFIG_SCHED_LPWORK=y     : Low priority queue support is needed
         CONFIG_SCHED_LPNTHREADS=1
         CONFIG_SCHED_LPWORKSTACKSIZE=1024

       NOTES:

       1. It is necessary to perform work on the low-priority work queue
          (vs. the high priority work queue) because deferred hub-related
          work requires some delays and waiting that is not appropriate on
          the high priority work queue.

       2. Stack usage make increase when USB hub support is enabled because
          the nesting depth of certain USB host class logic can increase.

       STATUS:
       2015-04-30
          Appears to be fully functional.

  nx
  --

    This a simple test using the graphic example at apps/example/nx.  This
    configuration illustrates the use of the LCD with the lower performance
    SPI interface.

  nxwm
  ----
    This is a special configuration setup for the NxWM window manager
    UnitTest.

    NOTES:

    1. The NxWM window manager can be found here:

         apps/graphics/NxWidgets/nxwm

       The NxWM unit test can be found at:

         apps/graphics/NxWidgets/UnitTests/nxwm

    STATUS:
      17-01-08:  There are instabilities in this configuration that make it
        not usable on this platform.  While the equivalent configuration works
        on other platforms, this one does not:  The calculator display does
        not form properly.  There are fails in the NxTerm display, usually
        around the point where the display should scroll up.

        Update:  With all optimizations disabled, the issue seems to go away.
        So this is most likely due to using high levels of optimization with a
        bleeding edge GCC toolchain.
      17-11-15: The original configuration used the slower SPI LCD interface.
        The configuration was converted to use the high performance LTDC frame
        buffer interface.  Performance is now excellent and I see none of the
        instabilities mentioned above even at high levels of optimization.

        The difficulty that I experienced was touching the tiny icons on the
        menus.  The touscreen controller (along with my fat fingers) does not
        appear to have sufficient precision to work in this way.  Larger icons
        would likely make the interface easier to use.

  usbnsh:
  ------

    This is another NSH example.  If differs from other 'nsh' configurations
    in that this configurations uses a USB serial device for console I/O.
    Such a configuration is useful on the stm32f429i-disco which has no
    builtin RS-232 drivers.

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
       change this configuration using that tool, you should:

       a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
          see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

       b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.

    2. This configuration does have UART1 output enabled and set up as
       the system logging device.  To use this UART, you must add an
       external RS-232 line driver to the UART1 pins of the DISCO board
       on PA9 and PA10 of connector P1.

  usbmsc:
  ------

    This is an example of enabling the FS OTG port on the DISCO board for
    mass storage use.  It provides an NSH session on UART1 to allow
    accessing the connected USB mass storage device.  Such a configuration
    is useful on the stm32f429i-disco which has no onboard SD card or mass
    storage solution.

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses UART1 as the system console.  To use this
       UART, you must add an external RS-232 line driver to the UART1 pins
       of the DISCO board on PA9 and PA10 of connector P1.

    2. The mass storage device will appear as /dev/sda and supports FAT
       formatted "thumb" flash drives with:

          nsh> mount -t vfat /dev/sda /mount_name
