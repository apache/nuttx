		Create the MTD driver for the AT24 and "wrap" the AT24 as a standard
		block driver that could then, for example, be mounted using FAT or
		any other file system.  Any file system may be used, but there will
		be no wear-leveling.

		Create the MTD driver for the AT24 and mount the AT24 device as
		a wear-leveling, NuttX FLASH file system (NXFFS).  The downside of
		NXFFS is that it can be very slow.
