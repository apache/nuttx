LEDs
====

  The LPC4088 OEM board has two user LEDs on GPIO pins:

    LED1 : Connected to P2[26]
    LED2 : Connected to P2[27]

  If CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is not defined, then the user can control the LEDs in
  any way using the definitions provided in the board.h header file.

  If CONFIG_ARCH_LEDs is defined, then NuttX will control the 2 LEDs on the
  LPC4088 OEM board.  The following definitions describe how NuttX controls
  the LEDs:
                               LED1 LED2 LED3 LED4
    LED_STARTED                OFF  OFF  OFF  OFF
    LED_HEAPALLOCATE           ON   OFF  OFF  OFF
    LED_IRQSENABLED            OFF   ON  OFF  OFF
    LED_STACKCREATED           ON    ON  OFF  OFF
    LED_INIRQ                  LED3 glows, on while in interrupt
    LED_SIGNAL                 LED3 glows, on while in signal handler
    LED_ASSERTION              LED3 glows, on while in assertion
    LED_PANIC                  LED3 Flashes at 2Hz
    LED_IDLE                   LED glows: ON while active; OFF while sleeping

    Several additional LEDs are available on a PCA9532 port expander, which is
    not currently enabled.
Buttons
=======

  The LPC4088 Developer's Kit supports a button:

    USER1           : Connected to P2[10]

  And a Joystick

    JOY_A           : Connected to P2[23]
    JOY_B           : Connected to P2[25]
    JOY_C           : Connected to P2[26]
    JOY_D           : Connected to P2[27]
    JOY_CTR         : Connected to P2[22]

  These can be accessed using the definitions and interfaces defined in the
  board.h header file.

  Several additional buttons are available on a PCA9532 port expander, which is
  not currently enabled.

Serial Console
==============

  By Default, UART0 is used as the serial console in all configurations.  This
  may be connected to your computer via the onboard FT232 USB to UART chip.

  As an option, UART1 can also be used for the serial console.  You might want,
  to do this, for example, if you use UART0 for the ISP function and you want
  to use a different UART for console output.  UART1 can be configured as the
  serial console by changing the configuration as follows:

    System Type:
      CONFIG_LPC17_40_UART0=n          : Disable UART0 if it is no longer used
      CONFIG_LPC17_40_UART1=y          : Enable UART1

    Drivers:
      CONFIG_UART1_SERIAL_CONSOLE=y : Setup up the UART1 configuration
      CONFIG_UART1_RXBUFSIZE=256
      CONFIG_UART1_TXBUFSIZE=256
      CONFIG_UART1_BAUD=115200
      CONFIG_UART1_BITS=8
      CONFIG_UART1_PARITY=0
      CONFIG_UART1_2STOP=0

  In this configuration using UART1, the jumpers JP12 and JP13 must be set to
  short pins 1 and 2.  UART 1 will then be available on the DB9 connector J17.

Using OpenOCD with the Olimex ARM-USB-OCD
=========================================

  Building OpenOCD under Cygwin:

    Refer to boards/olimex-lpc1766stk/README.txt

  Installing OpenOCD in Ubuntu Linux:

    sudo apt-get install openocd

  Helper Scripts.

    I have been using the Olimex ARM-USB-OCD debugger.  OpenOCD
    requires a configuration file.  I keep the one I used last here:

      boards/arm/lpc17xx_40xx/lpc4088-devkit/tools/lpc4088-devkit.cfg

    However, the "correct" configuration script to use with OpenOCD may
    change as the features of OpenOCD evolve.  So you should at least
    compare that lpc4088-devkit.cfg file with configuration files in
    /usr/share/openocd/scripts.  As of this writing, the configuration
    files of interest were:

      /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/interface/openocd-usb.cfg
        This is the configuration file for the Olimex ARM-USB-OCD
        debugger.  Select a different file if you are using some
        other debugger supported by OpenOCD.

      /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/board/?
        I don't see a board configuration file for the LPC4088 developer's kit.

      /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/target/lpc40xx.cfg
        This is the configuration file for the LPC4088 target.
        It just sets up a few parameters then sources lpc1xxx.cfg

      /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/target/lpc1xxx.cfg
        This is the generic LPC configuration for the LPC1xxx
        family.  It is included by lpc40xx.cfg.

    NOTE:  These files could also be located under /usr/share in some
    installations.  They could be most anywhwere if you are using a
    windows version of OpenOCD.

      boards/arm/lpc17xx_40xx/lpc4088-devkit/tools/lpc4088-devkit.cfg
        This is simply openocd-usb.cfg, lpc40xx.cfg, and lpc1xxx.cfg
        concatenated into one file for convenience.  Don't use it
        unless you have to.

    There is also a script on the tools/ directory that I use to start
    the OpenOCD daemon on my system called oocd.sh.  That script will
    probably require some modifications to work in another environment:

    - Possibly the value of OPENOCD_PATH and TARGET_PATH
    - It assumes that the correct script to use is the one at
      boards/arm/lpc17xx_40xx/lpc4088-devkit/tools/lpc4088-devkit.cfg

  Starting OpenOCD

    Then you should be able to start the OpenOCD daemon as follows.  This
    assumes that you have already CD'ed to the NuttX build directory and
    that you have set the full path to the
    boards/arm/lpc17xx_40xx/lpc4088-devkit/tools in your PATH environment
    variable:

      oocd.sh $PWD

    or, if the PATH variable is not so configured:

      boards/arm/lpc17xx_40xx/lpc4088-devkit/tools/oocd.sh $PWD

  Connecting GDB

    Once the OpenOCD daemon has been started, you can connect to it via
    GDB using the following GDB command:

      arm-nuttx-elf-gdb
      (gdb) target remote localhost:3333

    NOTE:  The name of your GDB program may differ.  For example, with the
    CodeSourcery toolchain, the ARM GDB would be called arm-none-eabi-gdb.

    OpenOCD will support several special 'monitor' sub-commands.  You can
    use the 'monitor' (or simply 'mon') command to invoke these sub-
    commands. These GDB commands will send comments to the OpenOCD monitor.
    Here are a couple that you will need to use:

     (gdb) monitor reset
     (gdb) monitor halt

    NOTES:

    1. The MCU must be halted using 'monitor halt' prior to loading code.

    2. 'monitor reset' will restart the processor after loading code.

    3. The 'monitor' command can be abbreviated as just 'mon'.

    After starting GDB, you can load the NuttX ELF file like this:

      (gdb) mon halt
      (gdb) load nuttx

    NOTES:

    1. NuttX should have been built so that it has debugging symbols
       (by setting CONFIG_DEBUG_SYMBOLS=y in the .config file).

    2. The MCU must be halted prior to loading code.

    3. I find that there are often undetected write failures when using
       the Olimex ARM-USB-OCD debugber and that if you start the program
       with a bad FLASH failure, it will lock up OpenOCD.  I usually
       oad nuttx twice, restarting OpenOCD in between in order to assure
       good FLASH contents:

      (gdb) mon halt
      (gdb) load nuttx
      (gdb) mon reset

      Exit GDB, kill the OpenOCD server, recycle power on the board,
      restart the OpenOCD server and GDB, then:

      (gdb) mon halt
      (gdb) load nuttx
      (gdb) mon reset

      Other debuggers may not have these issues and such drastic steps may
      not be necessary.

Loading Code with the ISP Board
===============================

  Users can also load code onto the board using the UART0 USB VCOM chip.
  I use the FlashMagic program for Windows available here:
  http://www.flashmagictool.com/ . It is so easy to use that no further
  explanation should be necessary:  Just select the LPC4088, the ISP COM
  port, and the NuttX .hex file and program it.

CONFIGURATION
=============

Information Common to All Configurations
----------------------------------------

  1. These configurations use the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
     change this configuration using that tool, you should:

     a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
        see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository
        README.txt.

     b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
        reconfiguration process.

  2. Most (but not all) configurations use the "GNU Tools for ARM
     Embedded Processors" that is maintained by ARM:

       https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm

     unless otherwise stated.

     That toolchain selection can easily be reconfigured using
     'make menuconfig'.  Here are the relevant current settings:

     Build Setup:
       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y               : Window environment
       CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y             : Cywin under Windows

     System Type -> Toolchain:
       CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y : GNU ARM EABI toolchain

  3. By Default, UART0 is used as the serial console in all configurations.
     This may be connected to your computer via an external RS-232 driver or
     via the on board USB VCOM chip.  See the section above entitled
     "Serial Console" for other options.

  4. An LCD is available for this board, but I don't have one to test with.
     If you wish to use any of the configurations below which utilize the LCD,
     you will need to tweak the LCD pin definitions in board.h.

Configuration Directories
-------------------------

  knsh
  ----
    This is identical to the nsh configuration below except that NuttX
    is built as a kernel-mode, monolithic module and the user applications
    are built separately.  Is is recommended to use a special make command;
    not just 'make' but make with the following two arguments:

        make pass1 pass2

    In the normal case (just 'make'), make will attempt to build both user-
    and kernel-mode blobs more or less interleaved.  This actual works!
    However, for me it is very confusing so I prefer the above make command:
    Make the user-space binaries first (pass1), then make the kernel-space
    binaries (pass2)

    1. Uses the older, OABI, buildroot toolchain.  But that is easily
       reconfigured:

       CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT=y : Buildroot toolchain
       CONFIG_ARMV7M_OABI_TOOLCHAIN=y      : Older, OABI toolchain

    2. This configuration has DMA-based SD card support enabled by
       default.  That support can be disabled as follow:

       CONFIG_LPC17_40_GPDMA=n                : No DMA
       CONFIG_ARCH_DMA=n
       CONFIG_LPC17_40_SDCARD=n               : No SD card driver
       CONFIG_SDIO_DMA=n                   : No SD card DMA
       CONFIG_MMCSD=n                      : No MMC/SD driver support
       CONFIG_FS_FAT=n                     : No FAT file system support

    3. At the end of the build, there will be several files in the top-level
       NuttX build directory:

       PASS1:
         nuttx_user.elf    - The pass1 user-space ELF file
         nuttx_user.hex    - The pass1 Intel HEX format file (selected in defconfig)
         User.map          - Symbols in the user-space ELF file

       PASS2:
         nuttx             - The pass2 kernel-space ELF file
         nuttx.hex         - The pass2 Intel HEX file (selected in defconfig)
         System.map        - Symbols in the kernel-space ELF file

       Loading these .elf files with OpenOCD is tricky.  It appears to me
       that when nuttx_user.elf is loaded, it destroys the nuttx image
       in FLASH.  But loading the nuttx ELF does not harm the nuttx_user.elf
       in FLASH.  Conclusion:  Always load nuttx_user.elf before nuttx.

       Just to complicate matters, it is sometimes the case that you need
       load objects twice to account for write failures.  I have not yet
       found a simple foolproof way to reliably get the code into FLASH.

    4. Combining .hex files.  If you plan to use the .hex files with your
       debugger or FLASH utility, then you may need to combine the two hex
       files into a single .hex file.  Here is how you can do that.

       a. The 'tail' of the nuttx.hex file should look something like this
          (with my comments added):

            $ tail nuttx.hex
            # 00, data records
            ...
            :10 9DC0 00 01000000000800006400020100001F0004
            :10 9DD0 00 3B005A0078009700B500D400F300110151
            :08 9DE0 00 30014E016D0100008D
            # 05, Start Linear Address Record
            :04 0000 05 0800 0419 D2
            # 01, End Of File record
            :00 0000 01 FF

          Use an editor such as vi to remove the 05 and 01 records.

       b. The 'head' of the nuttx_user.hex file should look something like
          this (again with my comments added):

            $ head nuttx_user.hex
            # 04, Extended Linear Address Record
            :02 0000 04 0801 F1
            # 00, data records
            :10 8000 00 BD89 01084C800108C8110208D01102087E
            :10 8010 00 0010 00201C1000201C1000203C16002026
            :10 8020 00 4D80 01085D80010869800108ED83010829
            ...

          Nothing needs to be done here.  The nuttx_user.hex file should
          be fine.

       c. Combine the edited nuttx.hex and un-edited nuttx_user.hex
          file to produce a single combined hex file:

          $ cat nuttx.hex nuttx_user.hex >combined.hex

       Then use the combined.hex file with the to write the FLASH image.
       If you do this a lot, you will probably want to invest a little time
       to develop a tool to automate these steps.

  nsh
  ---
    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at examples/nsh.  The
    Configuration enables both the serial NSH interface as well as the
    telnet interface over ethernet, with an IP address assigned via DHCP.
