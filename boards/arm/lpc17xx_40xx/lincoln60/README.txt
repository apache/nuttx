      reside in AHB SRAM.

USB Host Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Lincoln 60 board supports a USB host interface.  The hidkbd
example can be used to test this interface.

The NuttShell (NSH) lincoln60 can also be modified in order to support USB
host operations.  To make these modifications, do the following:

1. First configure to build the NSH configuration from the top-level
   NuttX directory:

   ./configure lincoln60/nsh

2. Then edit the top-level .config file to enable USB host.  Make the
   following changes:

   CONFIG_LPC17_40_USBHOST=y
   CONFIG_USBHOST=y
   CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE=y

When this change is made, NSH should be extended to support USB flash
devices.  When a FLASH device is inserted, you should see a device
appear in the /dev (pseudo) directory.  The device name should be
like /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, etc.  The USB mass storage device, is present
it can be mounted from the NSH command line like:

   ls /dev
   mount -t vfat /dev/sda /mnt/flash

Files on the connect USB flash device should then be accessible under
the mountpoint /mnt/flash.

Configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each Lincoln 60 configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and can be selected
as follow:

    tools/configure.sh lincoln60:<subdir>

Where <subdir> is one of the following:

  netnsh:
    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at apps/examples/nsh.  This
    configuration is similar to the nsh configuration except that network
    upport is enabled.

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
       change this configurations using that tool, you should:

       a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
          see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

       b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.

    2. This configuration is setup to build under Windows with Cygwin using
       the ARM EABI toolchain.  That is, however, easily reconfigured.

    3. This configuration uses a serial console on UART0 at 115200 8N1.
       This is the serial port at the connector labelled COM1 on the
       Lincoln 60.

    3. This example does initializes the network, then NSH sequentially.  It
       does not use the NSH network monitor thread.  There are two
       consequences to this:  1) There will be a delay booting to the NSH
       prompt while the network is brought up.  This delay will normally be
       small but it the network cable is unconnected, it can be very long
       (you may thing that the firmware is hung).  and 2) if the network is
       unplugged, then re-connected.  The network will not automatically be
       brought back up.  But you should be able to do that manually with
       the NSH ifup command.

       If you want better, more responsive network management, look into
       the NSH network monitor thread.

  nsh:
    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at apps/examples/nsh.

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
       change this configurations using that tool, you should:

       a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
          see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

       b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.

    2. This configuration is setup to build under Linux with the Nutt
       buildroot toolchain.  That is, however, easily reconfigured.

    3. This configuration uses a serial console on UART0 at 115200 8N1.
       This is the serial port at the connector labelled COM1 on the
       Lincoln 60.

    3. This configuration enables only the serial NSH interface.  See
       notes above for enabling USB host support in this configuration.

  thttpd-binfs:
    This builds the THTTPD web server example using the THTTPD and
    the apps/examples/thttpd application.  This version uses the built-in
    binary format with the BINFS file system and the Union File System.

    NOTES:

    1. Uses the ARM EABI toolchain under Windows.  But that is
       easily reconfigured:

       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y                   : Windows
       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y            : under Cygwin
       CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y     : GNU EABI toolchain for Windows

  STATUS:
    2015-06-06:  The BINFS CGI files are seems to be running, but the
      output that they generate does not appear in the browser window.
      I am suspecting that the redirected output is not working correctly
      with the BINFS applications.
