  NOTE:  Newer versions of the LM3S6965 Evaluation Kit has an OSAM 128x64x4 OLED
  display.  Some tweaks to drivers/lcd/p14201.c would be required to support that
  LCD.

Using OpenOCD and GDB with an FT2232 JTAG emulator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Building OpenOCD under Cygwin:

    Refer to boards/olimex-lpc1766stk/README.txt

  Installing OpenOCD in Linux:

    sudo apt-get install openocd

  Helper Scripts.

    I have been using the on-board FT2232 JTAG/SWD/SWO interface.  OpenOCD
    requires a configuration file.  I keep the one I used last here:

      boards/arm/tiva/lm3s6965-ek/tools/lm3s6965-ek.cfg

    However, the "correct" configuration script to use with OpenOCD may
    change as the features of OpenOCD evolve.  So you should at least
    compare that lm3s6965-ek.cfg file with configuration files in
    /usr/share/openocd/scripts.  As of this writing, the configuration
    files of interest were:

      /usr/share/openocd/scripts/interface/luminary.cfg
      /usr/share/openocd/scripts/board/ek-lm3s6965.cfg
      /usr/share/openocd/scripts/target/stellaris.cfg

    There is also a script on the tools/ directory that I use to start
    the OpenOCD daemon on my system called oocd.sh.  That script will
    probably require some modifications to work in another environment:

    - Possibly the value of OPENOCD_PATH and TARGET_PATH
    - It assumes that the correct script to use is the one at
      boards/arm/tiva/lm3s6965-ek/tools/lm3s6965-ek.cfg

  Starting OpenOCD

    Then you should be able to start the OpenOCD daemon like:

      boards/arm/tiva/lm3s6965-ek/tools/oocd.sh $PWD

  Connecting GDB

    Once the OpenOCD daemon has been started, you can connect to it via
    GDB using the following GDB command:

      arm-nuttx-elf-gdb
      (gdb) target remote localhost:3333

    NOTE:  The name of your GDB program may differ.  For example, with the
    CodeSourcery toolchain, the ARM GDB would be called arm-none-eabi-gdb.

    After starting GDB, you can load the NuttX ELF file:

      (gdb) symbol-file nuttx
      (gdb) monitor reset
      (gdb) monitor halt
      (gdb) load nuttx

    NOTES:
    1. Loading the symbol-file is only useful if you have built NuttX to
       include debug symbols (by setting CONFIG_DEBUG_SYMBOLS=y in the
       .config file).
    2. The MCU must be halted prior to loading code using 'mon reset'
       as described below.

    OpenOCD will support several special 'monitor' commands.  These
    GDB commands will send comments to the OpenOCD monitor.  Here
    are a couple that you will need to use:

     (gdb) monitor reset
     (gdb) monitor halt

    NOTES:
    1. The MCU must be halted using 'mon halt' prior to loading code.
    2. Reset will restart the processor after loading code.
    3. The 'monitor' command can be abbreviated as just 'mon'.

USB Device Controller Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Device Overview

    An FT2232 device from Future Technology Devices International Ltd manages
    USB-to-serial conversion. The FT2232 is factory configured by Luminary
    Micro to implement a JTAG/SWD port (synchronous serial) on channel A and
    a Virtual COM Port (VCP) on channel B. This feature allows two simultaneous
    communications links between the host computer and the target device using
    a single USB cable. Separate Windows drivers for each function are provided
    on the Documentation and Software CD.

  Debugging with JTAG/SWD

    The FT2232 USB device performs JTAG/SWD serial operations under the control
    of the debugger or the Luminary Flash Programmer.  It also operate as an
    In-Circuit Debugger Interface (ICDI), allowing debugging of any external
    target board.  Debugging modes:

                              the EVB.

  Virtual COM Port

    The Virtual COM Port (VCP) allows Windows applications (such as HyperTerminal)
    to communicate with UART0 on the LM3S6965 over USB. Once the FT2232 VCP
    driver is installed, Windows assigns a COM port number to the VCP channel.

Stellaris LM3S6965 Evaluation Kit Configuration Options

       CONFIG_RAM_SIZE=0x00010000 (64Kb)

    CONFIG_RAM_START - The start address of installed DRAM

       CONFIG_RAM_START=0x20000000

    CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS - Use LEDs to show state. Unique to boards that
       have LEDs

    CONFIG_ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK - This architecture supports an interrupt
       stack. If defined, this symbol is the size of the interrupt

    CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS -  Use LEDs to show state. Unique to board architecture.

  There are configurations for disabling support for interrupts GPIO ports.
  GPIOJ must be disabled because it does not exist on the LM3S6965.
  Additional interrupt support can be disabled if desired to reduce memory
  footprint.

    CONFIG_TIVA_GPIOA_IRQS=y
    CONFIG_TIVA_GPIOB_IRQS=y
    CONFIG_TIVA_GPIOC_IRQS=y
    CONFIG_TIVA_GPIOD_IRQS=y

      Poll-waiting is recommended if the interrupt rate would be to
      high in the interrupt driven case.
    CONFIG_SSI_TXLIMIT - Write this many words to the Tx FIFO before
      emptying the Rx FIFO.  If the SPI frequency is high and this
      value is large, then larger values of this setting may cause
      Rx FIFO overrun errors.  Default: half of the Tx FIFO size (4).

Configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each Stellaris LM3S6965 Evaluation Kit configuration is maintained in a
sub-directory and can be selected as follow:

    tools/configure.sh lm3s6965-ek:<subdir>

Where <subdir> is one of the following:

  discover:
    A configuration for the UDP discovery tool at apps/examples/discover.
    Contributed by Max Holtzberg.

    NOTES:
    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
       change this configuration using that tool, you should:

       a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
          see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

       b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.

    2. Default platform/toolchain:

    3. As it is configured now, you MUST have a network connected.
       Otherwise, the NSH prompt will not come up because the Ethernet
       driver is waiting for the network to come up.  That is probably
       a bug in the Ethernet driver behavior!
