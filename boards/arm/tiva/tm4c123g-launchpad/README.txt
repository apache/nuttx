AT24 Serial EEPROM
==================

  AT24 Connections
  ----------------

  A AT24C512 Serial EEPPROM was used for tested I2C.  There are no I2C
  devices on-board the Launchpad, but an external serial EEPROM module
  module was used.

  The Serial EEPROM was mounted on an external adaptor board and connected
  to the LaunchPad thusly:

    - VCC  J1 pin 1  3.3V
           J3 pin 1  5.0V
    - GND  J2 pin 1  GND
           J3 pin 2  GND
    - PB2  J2 pin 2  SCL
    - PB3  J4 pin 3  SDA

  Configuration Settings
  ----------------------

  The following configuration settings were used:

    System Type -> Tiva/Stellaris Peripheral Support
      CONFIG_TIVA_I2C0=y                    : Enable I2C

    System Type -> I2C device driver options
      TIVA_I2C_FREQUENCY=100000             : Select an I2C frequency

    Device Drivers -> I2C Driver Support
      CONFIG_I2C=y                          : Enable I2C support

    Device Drivers -> Memory Technology Device (MTD) Support
      CONFIG_MTD=y                          : Enable MTD support
      CONFIG_MTD_AT24XX=y                   : Enable the AT24 driver
      CONFIG_AT24XX_SIZE=512                : Specifies the AT 24C512 part
      CONFIG_AT24XX_ADDR=0x53               : AT24 I2C address

    Application Configuration -> NSH Library
      CONFIG_NSH_ARCHINIT=y                 : NSH board-initialization

    File systems
      CONFIG_NXFFS=y                        : Enables the NXFFS file system
      CONFIG_NXFFS_PREALLOCATED=y           : Required
                                            : Other defaults are probably OK

    Board Selection
      CONFIG_TM4C123G_LAUNCHPAD_AT24_BLOCKMOUNT=y   : Mounts AT24 for NSH
      CONFIG_TM4C123G_LAUNCHPAD_AT24_NXFFS=y        : Mount the AT24 using NXFFS

  You can then format the AT24 EEPROM for a FAT file system and mount the
  file system at /mnt/at24 using these NSH commands:

    nsh> mkfatfs /dev/mtdblock0
    nsh> mount -t vfat /dev/mtdblock0 /mnt/at24

  Then you an use the FLASH as a normal FAT file system:

    nsh> echo "This is a test" >/mnt/at24/atest.txt
    nsh> ls -l /mnt/at24
    /mnt/at24:
     -rw-rw-rw-      16 atest.txt
    nsh> cat /mnt/at24/atest.txt
    This is a test

  STATUS:
  2014-12-12:  I was unsuccessful getting my AT24 module to work on the TM4C123G
    LaunchPad.  I was unable to successuflly communication with the AT24 via
    I2C.  I did verify I2C using the I2C tool and other I2C devices and I now
    believe that my AT24 module is not fully functional.

I2C Tool
========

  I2C Tool. NuttX supports an I2C tool at apps/system/i2c that can be used
  to peek and poke I2C devices.  That tool can be enabled by setting the
  following:

    System Type -> TIVA Peripheral Support
      CONFIG_TIVA_I2C0=y                   : Enable I2C0
      CONFIG_TIVA_I2C1=y                   : Enable I2C1
      CONFIG_TIVA_I2C2=y                   : Enable I2C2
      ...

    System Type -> I2C device driver options
      CONFIG_TIVA_I2C0_FREQUENCY=100000    : Select an I2C0 frequency
      CONFIG_TIVA_I2C1_FREQUENCY=100000    : Select an I2C1 frequency
      CONFIG_TIVA_I2C2_FREQUENCY=100000    : Select an I2C2 frequency
      ...

    Device Drivers -> I2C Driver Support
      CONFIG_I2C=y                          : Enable I2C support

    Application Configuration -> NSH Library
      CONFIG_SYSTEM_I2CTOOL=y               : Enable the I2C tool
      CONFIG_I2CTOOL_MINBUS=0               : I2C0 has the minimum bus number 0
      CONFIG_I2CTOOL_MAXBUS=2               : I2C2 has the maximum bus number 2
      CONFIG_I2CTOOL_DEFFREQ=100000         : Pick a consistent frequency

    The I2C tool has extensive help that can be accessed as follows:

    nsh> i2c help
    Usage: i2c <cmd> [arguments]
    Where <cmd> is one of:

      Show help     : ?
      List buses    : bus
      List devices  : dev [OPTIONS] <first> <last>
      Read register : get [OPTIONS] [<repetitions>]
      Show help     : help
      Write register: set [OPTIONS] <value> [<repetitions>]
      Verify access : verf [OPTIONS] [<value>] [<repetitions>]

    Where common "sticky" OPTIONS include:
      [-a addr] is the I2C device address (hex).  Default: 03 Current: 03
      [-b bus] is the I2C bus number (decimal).  Default: 0 Current: 0
      [-r regaddr] is the I2C device register address (hex).  Default: 00 Current: 00
      [-w width] is the data width (8 or 16 decimal).  Default: 8 Current: 8
      [-s|n], send/don't send start between command and data.  Default: -n Current: -n
      [-i|j], Auto increment|don't increment regaddr on repetitions.  Default: NO Current: NO
      [-f freq] I2C frequency.  Default: 100000 Current: 100000

    NOTES:
    o Arguments are "sticky".  For example, once the I2C address is
      specified, that address will be re-used until it is changed.

    WARNING:
    o The I2C dev command may have bad side effects on your I2C devices.
      Use only at your own risk.

    As an example, the I2C dev command can be used to list all devices
    responding on I2C0 (the default) like this:

      nsh> i2c dev 0x03 0x77
          0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
      00:          -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
      10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 1a -- -- -- -- --
      20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
      30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 39 -- -- -- 3d -- --
      40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
      50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
      60: 60 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
      70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
      nsh>

    NOTE:  This is output from a different board and shows I2C
    devices responding at addresses 0x1a, 0x39, 0x3d, and 0x60.

Using OpenOCD and GDB with an FT2232 JTAG emulator
==================================================

  Building OpenOCD under Cygwin:

    Refer to boards/arm/lpc17xx_40xx/olimex-lpc1766stk/README.txt

  Installing OpenOCD in Linux:

      sudo apt-get install openocd

    As of this writing, there is no support for the tm4c123g in the package
    above. You will have to build openocd from its source (as of this writing
    the latest commit was b9b4bd1a6410ff1b2885d9c2abe16a4ae7cb885f):

      git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/openocd/code openocd
      cd openocd

    Then, add the patches provided by http://openocd.zylin.com/922:

      git fetch http://openocd.zylin.com/openocd refs/changes/22/922/14 && git checkout FETCH_HEAD
      ./bootstrap
      ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode --enable-ti-icdi
      make
      sudo make install

    For additional help, see http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Tiva_Launchpad_with_OpenOCD_and_Linux

  Helper Scripts.

    I have been using the on-board In-Circuit Debug Interface (ICDI) interface.
    OpenOCD requires a configuration file.  I keep the one I used last here:

      boards/arm/tiva/tm4c123g-launchpad/tools/tm4c123g-launchpad.cfg

    However, the "correct" configuration script to use with OpenOCD may
    change as the features of OpenOCD evolve.  So you should at least
    compare that tm4c123g-launchpad.cfg file with configuration files in
    /usr/share/openocd/scripts.  As of this writing, the configuration
    files of interest were:

      /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/board/ek-tm4c123gxl.cfg
      /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/interface/ti-icdi.cfg
      /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/target/stellaris_icdi.cfg

    There is also a script on the tools/ directory that I use to start
    the OpenOCD daemon on my system called oocd.sh.  That script will
    probably require some modifications to work in another environment:

    - Possibly the value of OPENOCD_PATH and TARGET_PATH
    - It assumes that the correct script to use is the one at
      boards/arm/tiva/tm4c123g-launchpad/tools/tm4c123g-launchpad.cfg

  Starting OpenOCD

    If you are in the top-level NuttX build directlory then you should
    be able to start the OpenOCD daemon like:

      oocd.sh $PWD

    The relative path to the oocd.sh script is:
      boards/arm/tiva/tm4c123g-launchpad/tools.

    You may want to add that path to your PATH variable.

    Note that OpenOCD needs to be run with administrator privileges in
    some environments (sudo).

  Connecting GDB

    Once the OpenOCD daemon has been started, you can connect to it via
    GDB using the following GDB command:

      arm-nuttx-elf-gdb
      (gdb) target remote localhost:3333

    NOTE:  The name of your GDB program may differ.  For example, with the
    CodeSourcery toolchain, the ARM GDB would be called arm-none-eabi-gdb.

    After starting GDB, you can load the NuttX ELF file:

      (gdb) symbol-file nuttx
      (gdb) monitor reset
      (gdb) monitor halt
      (gdb) load nuttx

    NOTES:
    1. Loading the symbol-file is only useful if you have built NuttX to
       include debug symbols (by setting CONFIG_DEBUG_SYMBOLS=y in the
       .config file).
    2. The MCU must be halted prior to loading code using 'mon reset'
       as described below.

    OpenOCD will support several special 'monitor' commands.  These
    GDB commands will send comments to the OpenOCD monitor.  Here
    are a couple that you will need to use:

     (gdb) monitor reset
     (gdb) monitor halt

    NOTES:
    1. The MCU must be halted using 'mon halt' prior to loading code.
    2. Reset will restart the processor after loading code.
    3. The 'monitor' command can be abbreviated as just 'mon'.

LEDs
====
  The TM4C123G has a single RGB LED.  If CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is defined, then
  support for the LaunchPad LEDs will be included in the build.  See:

  - boards/arm/tiva/tm4c123g-launchpad/include/board.h - Defines LED
    constants, types and prototypes the LED interface functions.

  - boards/arm/tiva/tm4c123g-launchpad/src/tm4c123g-launchpad.h - GPIO
    settings for the LEDs.

  - boards/arm/tiva/tm4c123g-launchpad/src/up_leds.c - LED control logic.

  OFF:
  - OFF means that the OS is still initializing. Initialization is very fast so
    if you see this at all, it probably means that the system is hanging up
    somewhere in the initialization phases.

  GREEN or GREEN-ish
  - This means that the OS completed initialization.

  Bluish:
  - Whenever and interrupt or signal handler is entered, the BLUE LED is
    illuminated and extinguished when the interrupt or signal handler exits.
    This will add a BLUE-ish tinge to the LED.

  Redish:
  - If a recovered assertion occurs, the RED component will be illuminated
    briefly while the assertion is handled.  You will probably never see this.

  Flashing RED:
  - In the event of a fatal crash, the BLUE and GREEN components will be
    extinguished and the RED component will FLASH at a 2Hz rate.

Serial Console
==============

  By default, all configurations use UART0 which connects to the USB VCOM
  on the DEBUG port on the TM4C123G LaunchPad:

    UART0 RX - PA.0
    UART0 TX - PA.1

  However, if you use an external RS232 driver, then other options are
  available.  UART1 has option pin settings and flow control capabilities
  that are not available with the other UARTS::

    UART1 RX - PB.0 or PC.4 (Need disambiguation in board.h)
    UART1 TX - PB.1 or PC.5 ("  " "            " "" "     ")

    UART1_RTS - PF.0 or PC.4
    UART1_CTS - PF.1 or PC.5

  NOTE: board.h currently selects PB.0, PB.1, PF.0 and PF.1 for UART1, but
  that can be changed by editing board.h

  UART2-5, 7 are also available, UART2 is not recommended because it shares
  some pin usage with USB device mode.  UART6 is not available because its
  only RX/TX pin options are dedicated to USB support.

    UART2 RX - PD.6
    UART2 TX - PD.7 (Also used for USB VBUS detection)

    UART3 RX - PC.6
    UART3 TX - PC.7

    UART4 RX - PC.4
    UART4 TX - PC.5

    UART5 RX - PE.4
    UART5 TX - PE.5

    UART6 RX - PD.4, Not available.  Dedicated for USB_DM
    UART6 TX - PD.5, Not available.  Dedicated for USB_DP

    UART7 RX - PE.0
    UART7 TX - PE.1

USB Device Controller Functions
===============================

  Device Overview

    An FT2232 device from Future Technology Devices International Ltd manages
    USB-to-serial conversion. The FT2232 is factory configured by Luminary
    Micro to implement a JTAG/SWD port (synchronous serial) on channel A and
    a Virtual COM Port (VCP) on channel B. This feature allows two simultaneous
    communications links between the host computer and the target device using
    a single USB cable. Separate Windows drivers for each function are provided
    on the Documentation and Software CD.

  Debugging with JTAG/SWD

    The FT2232 USB device performs JTAG/SWD serial operations under the control
    of the debugger or the Luminary Flash Programmer.  It also operate as an
    In-Circuit Debugger Interface (ICDI), allowing debugging of any external
    target board.  Debugging modes:

  Virtual COM Port

    The Virtual COM Port (VCP) allows Windows applications (such as HyperTerminal)
    to communicate with UART0 on the TM4C123G over USB. Once the FT2232 VCP
    driver is installed, Windows assigns a COM port number to the VCP channel.

MCP2515 - SPI - CAN
===================

  I like CANbus, and having an MCP2515 CAN Bus Module laying around
  gave me the idea to implement it on the TM4C123GXL (Launchpad).
  NuttX already had implemented it on the STM32. So a lot of work already
  has been done. It uses SPI and with this Launchpad we use SSI.

  Here is how I have the MCP2515 Module connected. But you can change
  this with the settings in include/board.h and src/tm4c123g-launchpad.h.

  Connector pinout that I am using:

    --------------------------+----------------------------------------------
    Connector CAN Module      | Launchpad TM4C123GXL (SSI2_1)
    --------------------------+----------------------------------------------
    1  INT                    | PB0
    2  SCK                    | PB4 (Clock)
    3  SI                     | PB7 (MOSI = TX)
    4  SO                     | PB6 (MISO = RX)
    5  CS                     | PB5 (Chip Select)
    6  GND                    | GND
    7  VCC                    | VBUS (+5V)
  --------------------------+----------------------------------------------

  PS: I have to test the CS signal when adding it on a bus with multiple nodes.

TM4C123G LaunchPad Configuration Options
========================================

    CONFIG_ARCH - Identifies the arch/ subdirectory.  This should
       be set to:

       CONFIG_ARCH=arm

    CONFIG_ARCH_family - For use in C code:

       CONFIG_ARCH_ARM=y

    CONFIG_ARCH_architecture - For use in C code:

       CONFIG_ARCH_CORTEXM4=y

    CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP - Identifies the arch/*/chip subdirectory

       CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP="tiva"

    CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP_name - For use in C code to identify the exact
       chip:

       CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP_TM4C123GH6PM

    CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD - Identifies the boards/ subdirectory and
       hence, the board that supports the particular chip or SoC.

       CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD=tm4c123g-launchpad (for the TM4C123G LaunchPad)

    CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_name - For use in C code

       CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_TM4C123G_LAUNCHPAD

    CONFIG_ARCH_LOOPSPERMSEC - Must be calibrated for correct operation
       of delay loops

    CONFIG_ENDIAN_BIG - define if big endian (default is little
       endian)

    CONFIG_RAM_SIZE - Describes the installed DRAM (SRAM in this case):

       CONFIG_RAM_SIZE=0x00008000 (32Kb)

    CONFIG_RAM_START - The start address of installed DRAM

       CONFIG_RAM_START=0x20000000

    CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS - Use LEDs to show state. Unique to boards that
       have LEDs

    CONFIG_ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK - This architecture supports an interrupt
       stack. If defined, this symbol is the size of the interrupt
       stack in bytes.  If not defined, the user task stacks will be
       used during interrupt handling.

    CONFIG_ARCH_STACKDUMP - Do stack dumps after assertions

    CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS -  Use LEDs to show state. Unique to board architecture.

  There are configurations for disabling support for interrupts GPIO ports.
  Only GPIOP and GPIOQ pins can be used as interrupting sources on the
  TM4C129x.  Additional interrupt support can be disabled if desired to
  reduce memory footprint.

    CONFIG_TIVA_GPIOP_IRQS=y
    CONFIG_TIVA_GPIOQ_IRQS=y

  TM4C123G specific device driver settings

    CONFIG_UARTn_SERIAL_CONSOLE - selects the UARTn for the
       console and ttys0 (default is the UART0).
    CONFIG_UARTn_RXBUFSIZE - Characters are buffered as received.
       This specific the size of the receive buffer
    CONFIG_UARTn_TXBUFSIZE - Characters are buffered before
       being sent.  This specific the size of the transmit buffer
    CONFIG_UARTn_BAUD - The configure BAUD of the UART.  Must be
    CONFIG_UARTn_BITS - The number of bits.  Must be either 7 or 8.
    CONFIG_UARTn_PARTIY - 0=no parity, 1=odd parity, 2=even parity
    CONFIG_UARTn_2STOP - Two stop bits

    CONFIG_TIVA_SSI0 - Select to enable support for SSI0
    CONFIG_TIVA_SSI1 - Select to enable support for SSI1
    CONFIG_SSI_POLLWAIT - Select to disable interrupt driven SSI support.
      Poll-waiting is recommended if the interrupt rate would be to
      high in the interrupt driven case.
    CONFIG_SSI_TXLIMIT - Write this many words to the Tx FIFO before
      emptying the Rx FIFO.  If the SPI frequency is high and this
      value is large, then larger values of this setting may cause
      Rx FIFO overrun errors.  Default: half of the Tx FIFO size (4).

    CONFIG_TIVA_ETHERNET - This must be set (along with CONFIG_NET)
      to build the Tiva Ethernet driver
    CONFIG_TIVA_ETHLEDS - Enable to use Ethernet LEDs on the board.
    CONFIG_TIVA_BOARDMAC - If the board-specific logic can provide
      a MAC address (via tiva_ethernetmac()), then this should be selected.
    CONFIG_TIVA_ETHHDUPLEX - Set to force half duplex operation
    CONFIG_TIVA_ETHNOAUTOCRC - Set to suppress auto-CRC generation
    CONFIG_TIVA_ETHNOPAD - Set to suppress Tx padding
    CONFIG_TIVA_MULTICAST - Set to enable multicast frames
    CONFIG_TIVA_PROMISCUOUS - Set to enable promiscuous mode
    CONFIG_TIVA_BADCRC - Set to enable bad CRC rejection.
    CONFIG_TIVA_DUMPPACKET - Dump each packet received/sent to the console.

Configurations
==============

Each TM4C123G LaunchPad configuration is maintained in a sub-directory of
boards/arm/tiva/tm4c123g-launchpad/configs/ and can be selected as follows:

    tools/configure.sh tm4c123g-launchpad:<subdir>

Where <subdir> is one of the following:

  mcp2515
  =======
    Configuration uses the MCP2515 SPI CAN part.  See the section entitled
    "MCP2515 - SPI - CAN" above.

  nsh:
  ---
    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at apps/examples/nsh.  The
    configuration enables the serial VCOM interfaces on UART0.  Support for
    builtin applications is enabled, but in the base configuration no builtin
    applications are selected.

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
       change this configuration using that tool, you should:

       a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
          see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

       b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.

    2. By default, this configuration uses the ARM EABI toolchain
       for Windows and builds under Cygwin (or probably MSYS).  That
       can easily be reconfigured, of course.

       CONFIG_HOST_LINUX=y                 : Linux (Cygwin under Windows okay too).
       CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT=y : Buildroot (arm-nuttx-elf-gcc)
       CONFIG_RAW_BINARY=y                 : Output formats: ELF and raw binary
