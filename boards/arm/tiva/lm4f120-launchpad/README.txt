Using OpenOCD and GDB with an FT2232 JTAG emulator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Building OpenOCD under Cygwin:

    Refer to boards/olimex-lpc1766stk/README.txt

  Installing OpenOCD in Linux:

      sudo apt-get install openocd

    As of this writing, there is no support for the lm4f120 in the package
    above. You will have to build openocd from its source (as of this writing
    the latest commit was b9b4bd1a6410ff1b2885d9c2abe16a4ae7cb885f):

      git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/openocd/code openocd
      cd openocd

    Then, add the patches provided by http://openocd.zylin.com/922:

      git fetch http://openocd.zylin.com/openocd refs/changes/22/922/14 && git checkout FETCH_HEAD
      ./bootstrap
      ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode --enable-ti-icdi
      make
      sudo make install

    For additional help, see http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Stellaris_Launchpad_with_OpenOCD_and_Linux

  Helper Scripts.

    I have been using the on-board In-Circuit Debug Interface (ICDI) interface.
    OpenOCD requires a configuration file.  I keep the one I used last here:

      boards/arm/tiva/lm4f120-launchpad/tools/lm4f120-launchpad.cfg

    However, the "correct" configuration script to use with OpenOCD may
    change as the features of OpenOCD evolve.  So you should at least
    compare that lm4f120-launchpad.cfg file with configuration files in
    /usr/share/openocd/scripts.  As of this writing, the configuration
    files of interest were:

      /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/board/ek-lm4f120xl.cfg
      /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/interface/ti-icdi.cfg
      /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/target/stellaris_icdi.cfg

    There is also a script on the tools/ directory that I use to start
    the OpenOCD daemon on my system called oocd.sh.  That script will
    probably require some modifications to work in another environment:

    - Possibly the value of OPENOCD_PATH and TARGET_PATH
    - It assumes that the correct script to use is the one at
      boards/arm/tiva/lm4f120-launchpad/tools/lm4f120-launchpad.cfg

  Starting OpenOCD

    If you are in the top-level NuttX build directlory then you should
    be able to start the OpenOCD daemon like:

      oocd.sh $PWD

    provided that you have the path to the oocd.sh script, boards/arm/tiva/lm4f120-launchpad/tools,
    added to your PATH variable.

    Note that OpenOCD needs to be run with administrator privileges in
    some environments (sudo).

  Connecting GDB

    Once the OpenOCD daemon has been started, you can connect to it via
    GDB using the following GDB command:

      arm-nuttx-elf-gdb
      (gdb) target remote localhost:3333

    NOTE:  The name of your GDB program may differ.  For example, with the
    CodeSourcery toolchain, the ARM GDB would be called arm-none-eabi-gdb.

    After starting GDB, you can load the NuttX ELF file:

      (gdb) symbol-file nuttx
      (gdb) monitor reset
      (gdb) monitor halt
      (gdb) load nuttx

    NOTES:
    1. Loading the symbol-file is only useful if you have built NuttX to
       include debug symbols (by setting CONFIG_DEBUG_SYMBOLS=y in the
       .config file).
    2. The MCU must be halted prior to loading code using 'mon reset'
       as described below.

    OpenOCD will support several special 'monitor' commands.  These
    GDB commands will send comments to the OpenOCD monitor.  Here
    are a couple that you will need to use:

     (gdb) monitor reset
     (gdb) monitor halt

    NOTES:
    1. The MCU must be halted using 'mon halt' prior to loading code.
    2. Reset will restart the processor after loading code.
    3. The 'monitor' command can be abbreviated as just 'mon'.

LEDs
^^^^
  The LM4F120 has a single RGB LED.  If CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is defined, then
  support for the LaunchPad LEDs will be included in the build.  See:

  - boards/arm/tiva/lm4f120-launchpad/include/board.h - Defines LED constants, types and
    prototypes the LED interface functions.

  - boards/arm/tiva/lm4f120-launchpad/src/lm4f120-launchpad.h - GPIO settings for the LEDs.

  - boards/arm/tiva/lm4f120-launchpad/src/up_leds.c - LED control logic.

  OFF:
  - OFF means that the OS is still initializing. Initialization is very fast so
    if you see this at all, it probably means that the system is hanging up
    somewhere in the initialization phases.

  GREEN or GREEN-ish
  - This means that the OS completed initialization.

  Bluish:
  - Whenever and interrupt or signal handler is entered, the BLUE LED is
    illuminated and extinguished when the interrupt or signal handler exits.
    This will add a BLUE-ish tinge to the LED.

  Redish:
  - If a recovered assertion occurs, the RED component will be illuminated
    briefly while the assertion is handled.  You will probably never see this.

  Flashing RED:
  - In the event of a fatal crash, the BLUE and GREEN components will be
    extinguished and the RED component will FLASH at a 2Hz rate.

Serial Console
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  By default, all configurations use UART0 which connects to the USB VCOM
  on the DEBUG port on the LM4F120 LaunchPad:

    UART0 RX  - PA.0
    UART0 TX  - PA.1

  However, if you use an external RS232 driver, then other options are
  available.  UART1 has option pin settings and flow control capabilities
  that are not available with the other UARTS::

    UART1 RX  - PB.0 or PC.4 (Need disambiguation in board.h)
    UART1 TX  - PB.1 or PC.5 ("  " "            " "" "     ")

    UART1_RTS - PF.0 or PC.4
    UART1_CTS - PF.1 or PC.5

  NOTE: board.h currently selects PB.0, PB.1, PF.0 and PF.1 for UART1, but
  that can be changed by editing board.h

  UART2-5, 7 are also available, UART2 is not recommended because it shares
  some pin usage with USB device mode.  UART6 is not available because its
  only RX/TX pin options are dedicated to USB support.

    UART2 RX  - PD.6
    UART2 TX  - PD.7 (Also used for USB VBUS detection)

    UART3 RX  - PC.6
    UART3 TX  - PC.7

    UART4 RX  - PC.4
    UART4 TX  - PC.5

    UART5 RX  - PE.4
    UART5 TX  - PE.5

    UART6 RX  - PD.4, Not available.  Dedicated for USB_DM
    UART6 TX  - PD.5, Not available.  Dedicated for USB_DP

    UART7 RX  - PE.0
    UART7 TX  - PE.1

USB Device Controller Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Device Overview

    An FT2232 device from Future Technology Devices International Ltd manages
    USB-to-serial conversion. The FT2232 is factory configured by Luminary
    Micro to implement a JTAG/SWD port (synchronous serial) on channel A and
    a Virtual COM Port (VCP) on channel B. This feature allows two simultaneous
    communications links between the host computer and the target device using
    a single USB cable. Separate Windows drivers for each function are provided
    on the Documentation and Software CD.

  Debugging with JTAG/SWD

    The FT2232 USB device performs JTAG/SWD serial operations under the control
    of the debugger or the Luminary Flash Programmer.  It also operate as an
    In-Circuit Debugger Interface (ICDI), allowing debugging of any external
    target board.  Debugging modes:

                              the EVB.

  Virtual COM Port

    The Virtual COM Port (VCP) allows Windows applications (such as HyperTerminal)
    to communicate with UART0 on the LM4F120 over USB. Once the FT2232 VCP
    driver is installed, Windows assigns a COM port number to the VCP channel.

LM4F120 LaunchPad Configuration Options

Configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each LM4F120 LaunchPad configuration is maintained in a
sub-directory and can be selected as follow:

    tools/configure.sh lm4f120-launchpad:<subdir>

Where <subdir> is one of the following:

  nsh:
  ---
    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at apps/examples/nsh.  The
    configuration enables the serial VCOM interfaces on UART0.  Support for
    builtin applications is enabled, but in the base configuration no
    builtin applications are selected.

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
       change this configuration using that tool, you should:

       a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
          see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

       b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.

    2. By default, this configuration uses the ARM EABI toolchain
