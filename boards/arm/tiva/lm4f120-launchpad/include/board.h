 * - OFF means that the OS is still initializing. Initialization is very fast
 *   so if you see this at all, it probably means that the system is hanging
 *   up somewhere in the initialization phases.
 *
 * GREEN or GREEN-ish
 * - This means that the OS completed initialization.
 *
 * Bluish:
 * - Whenever and interrupt or signal handler is entered, the BLUE LED is
 *   illuminated and extinguished when the interrupt or signal handler exits.
 *   This will add a BLUE-ish tinge to the LED.
 *
 * Redish:
 * - If a recovered assertion occurs, the RED component will be illuminated
 *   briefly while the assertion is handled.
 *   You will probably never see this.
 *
 * Flashing RED:
 * - In the event of a fatal crash, the BLUE and GREEN components will be
 *   extinguished and the RED component will FLASH at a 2Hz rate.
