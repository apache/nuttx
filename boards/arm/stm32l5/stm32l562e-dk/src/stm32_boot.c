 *   entry point is called early in the intitialization -- after all memory
 *   has been configured and mapped but before any devices have been
 *   initialized.

 *   be called immediately after up_initialize() is called and just before
 *   the initial application is started.  This additional initialization
 *   phase may be used, for example, to initialize board-specific device
 *   drivers.
