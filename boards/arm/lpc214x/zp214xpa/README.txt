Using OpenOCD and GDB with an FT2232 JTAG emulator
==================================================

  Downloading OpenOCD

    You can get information about OpenOCD here: http://openocd.berlios.de/web/
    and you can download it from here. http://sourceforge.net/projects/openocd/files/.
    To get the latest OpenOCD with more mature lpc214x, you have to download
    from the GIT archive.

      git clone git://openocd.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/openocd/openocd

    At present, there is only the older, frozen 0.4.0 version.  These, of course,
    may have changed since I wrote this.

  Building OpenOCD under Cygwin:

    You can build OpenOCD for Windows using the Cygwin tools.  Below are a
    few notes that worked as of November 7, 2010.  Things may have changed
    by the time you read this, but perhaps the following will be helpful to
    you:

    1. Install Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/).  My recommendation is to install
       everything.  There are many tools you will need and it is best just to
       waste a little disk space and have everything you need.  Everything will
       require a couple of gigbytes of disk space.

    2. Create a directory /home/OpenOCD.

    3. Get the FT2232 driver from http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm and
       extract it into /home/OpenOCD/ftd2xx

       $ pwd
       /home/OpenOCD
       $ ls
       CDM20802 WHQL Certified.zip
       $ mkdir ftd2xx
       $ cd ftd2xx
       $ unzip ..CDM20802\ WHQL\ Certified.zip
       Archive:  CDM20802 WHQL Certified.zip
       ...

    3. Get the latest OpenOCD source

       $ pwd
       /home/OpenOCD
       $ git clone git://openocd.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/openocd/openocd

       You will then have the source code in /home/OpenOCD/openocd

    4. Build OpenOCD for the FT22322 interface

       $ pwd
       /home/OpenOCD/openocd
       $ ./bootstrap

       Jim is a tiny version of the Tcl scripting language.  It is needed
       by more recent versions of OpenOCD.  Build libjim.a using the following
       instructions:

       $ git submodule init
       $ git submodule update
       $ cd jimtcl
       $ ./configure --with-jim-ext=nvp
       $ make
       $ make install

       Configure OpenOCD:

       $ ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode --disable-werror --disable-shared \
                    --enable-ft2232_ftd2xx --with-ftd2xx-win32-zipdir=/home/OpenOCD/ftd2xx \
                    LDFLAGS="-L/home/OpenOCD/openocd/jimtcl"

        Then build OpenOCD and its HTML documentation:

        $ make
        $ make html

        The result of the first make will be the "openocd.exe" will be
        created in the folder /home/openocd/src.  The following command
        will install OpenOCD to a standard location (/usr/local/bin)
        using using this command:

        $ make install

  Helper Scripts.

    I have been using the Olimex ARM-USB-OCD JTAG debugger with the
    ZP213X/4XPA.  OpenOCD requires a configuration file.  I keep the
    one I used last here:

      boards/zpa214xpa/tools/olimex.cfg

    However, the "correct" configuration script to use with OpenOCD may
    change as the features of OpenOCD evolve.  So you should at least
    compare that olimex.cfg file with configuration files in
    /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/target (or /home/OpenOCD/openocd/tcl/target).

    There is also a script on the tools/ directory that I use to start
    the OpenOCD daemon on my system called oocd.sh.  That script will
    probably require some modifications to work in another environment:

    - Possibly the value of OPENOCD_PATH and TARGET_PATH
    - It assumes that the correct script to use is the one at
      boards/arm/lpc214x/zp214xpa/tools/olimex.cfg

  Starting OpenOCD

    Then you should be able to start the OpenOCD daemon like:

      boards/arm/lpc214x/zp214xpa/tools/oocd.sh $PWD

    If you add that path to your PATH environment variable, the command
    simplifies to just:

      oocd.sh $PWD

    Where it is assumed that you are executing oocd.sh from the top-level
    directory where NuttX is installed.  $PWD will be the path to the
    top-level NuttX directory.

  Connecting GDB

    Once the OpenOCD daemon has been started, you can connect to it via
    GDB using the following GDB command:

      arm-nuttx-elf-gdb
      (gdb) target remote localhost:3333

    NOTE:  The name of your GDB program may differ.  For example, with the
    CodeSourcery toolchain, the ARM GDB would be called arm-none-eabi-gdb.

    After starting GDB, you can load the NuttX ELF file:

      (gdb) symbol-file nuttx
      (gdb) load nuttx

    NOTES:
    1. Loading the symbol-file is only useful if you have built NuttX to
       include debug symbols (by setting CONFIG_DEBUG_SYMBOLS=y in the
       .config file).

    OpenOCD will support several special 'monitor' commands.  These
    GDB commands will send comments to the OpenOCD monitor.  Here
    are a couple that you will need to use:

     (gdb) monitor reset
     (gdb) monitor halt

    NOTES:
    1. The MCU must be halted using 'mon halt' prior to loading code.
    2. Reset will restart the processor after loading code.
    3. The 'monitor' command can be abbreviated as just 'mon'.

Configurations:
===============

  Each NXP LPC214x configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
  can be selected as follow:

    tools/configure.sh zp214xpa:<subdir>

  Where <subdir> is one of the following:

  nsh:
  ----

    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at examples/nsh.  The
    Configuration enables only the serial NSH interfaces.

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
       change this configuration using that tool, you should:

       a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
          see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

       b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.

    2. Default platform/toolchain:

       CONFIG_HOST_LINUX=y              : Linux (Cygwin under Windows okay too).
       CONFIG_ARM_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIL=y : Buildroot (arm-nuttx-elf-gcc)
       CONFIG_RAW_BINARY=y              : Output formats: ELF and raw binary

  nxlines:
  --------

    This is the apps/examples/nxlines test using the UG_2864AMBAG01 board
    from The0.net that plugs into the "SPI LCD" connector on the ZP3X4XPA
    board.

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
       change this configuration using that tool, you should:

       a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
          see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

       b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.

    2. Default platform/toolchain:

       CONFIG_HOST_LINUX=y              : Linux (Cygwin under Windows okay too).
       CONFIG_ARM_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIL=y : Buildroot (arm-nuttx-elf-gcc)
       CONFIG_RAW_BINARY=y              : Output formats: ELF and raw binary

    STATUS:
    2012-12-30:  Configuration verified.

    2017-11-25:  Grrr... This configuration no longer works.  Some serious bit
      rot has set in.  Now only random garbage appears on the OLED.  Certainly
      a lot has changed since 2012, but I cannot see any change to either this
      configuration, to the LCD driver, or to the LPC2148 support that would
      affect the operation of the LCD.  The nsh configuration is still functional.
