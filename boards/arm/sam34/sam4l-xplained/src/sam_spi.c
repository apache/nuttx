 * Name:  sam_spi0select, sam_spi0status, and sam_spic0mddata
 *
 * Description:
 *   These external functions must be provided by board-specific logic.  They
 *   include:
 *
 *   o sam_spi0select is a functions tomanage the board-specific chip selects
 *   o sam_spi0status and sam_spic0mddata:  Implementations of the status
 *     and cmddata methods of the SPI interface defined by struct spi_ops_
 *     (see include/nuttx/spi/spi.h). All other methods including
 *     sam_spibus_initialize()) are provided by common SAM3/4 logic.
 *
 *  To use this common SPI logic on your board:
 *
 *   1. Provide logic in sam_boardinitialize() to configure SPI chip select
 *      pins.
 *   2. Provide sam_spi0select() and sam_spi0status() functions in your
 *      board specific logic. These functions will perform chip selection and
 *      status operations using GPIOs in the way your board is configured.
 *   2. If CONFIG_SPI_CMDDATA is defined in the NuttX configuration, provide
 *      sam_spic0mddata() functions in your board-specific logic.  This
 *      function will perform cmd/data selection operations using GPIOs in
 *      the way your board is configured.
 *   3. Add a call to sam_spibus_initialize() in your low level application
 *      initialization logic
 *   4. The handle returned by sam_spibus_initialize() may then be used to
 *      bind the SPI driver to higher level logic (e.g., calling
 *      mmcsd_spislotinitialize(), for example, will bind the SPI driver to
 *      the SPI MMC/SD driver).

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: sam_spi0select
 *
 * Description:
 *   PIO chip select pins may be programmed by the board specific logic in
 *   one of two different ways.  First, the pins may be programmed as SPI
 *   peripherals.  In that case, the pins are completely controlled by the
 *   SPI driver.  This method still needs to be provided, but it may be only
 *   a stub.
 *
 *   An alternative way to program the PIO chip select pins is as a normal
 *   GPIO output.  In that case, the automatic control of the CS pins is
 *   bypassed and this function must provide control of the chip select.
 *   NOTE:  In this case, the GPIO output pin does *not* have to be the
 *   same as the NPCS pin normal associated with the chip select number.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   devid - Identifies the (logical) device
 *   selected - TRUE:Select the device, FALSE:De-select the device
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None

 * Description:
 *   Some SPI devices require an additional control to determine if the SPI

 *
 *   This is often needed, for example, by LCD drivers.  Some LCD hardware
 *   may be configured to use 9-bit data transfers with the 9th bit
 *   indicating command or data.  That same hardware may be configurable,
 *   instead, to use 8-bit data but to require an additional, board-
 *   specific GPIO control to distinguish command and data.  This function
 *   would be needed in that latter case.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   dev - SPI device info
 *   devid - Identifies the (logical) device
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero on success; a negated errno on failure.
