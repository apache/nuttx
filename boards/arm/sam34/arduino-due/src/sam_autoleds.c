/*  There are three user-controllable LEDs on board the Arduino Due board:
 *
 *     LED              GPIO
 *     ---------------- -----
 *     L   Amber LED    PB27
 *     TX  Yellow LED   PA21
 *     RX  Yellow LED   PC30
 *
 * LED L is connected to ground and can be illuminated by driving the PB27
 * output high. The TX and RX LEDs are pulled high and can be illuminated by
 * driving the corresponding
 * GPIO output to low.
 *
 * These LEDs are not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
 * defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
 * include/board.h and src/sam_leds.c. The LEDs are used to encode OS-related
 * events as follows:
 *
 *   SYMBOL                MEANING                         LED STATE
 *                                                   L         TX       RX
 *   -------------------  -----------------------  -------- -------- --------
 *   LED_STARTED          NuttX has been started     OFF      OFF      OFF
 *   LED_HEAPALLOCATE     Heap has been allocated    OFF      OFF      OFF
 *   LED_IRQSENABLED      Interrupts enabled         OFF      OFF      OFF
 *   LED_STACKCREATED     Idle stack created         ON       OFF      OFF
 *   LED_INIRQ            In an interrupt            N/C      GLOW     OFF
 *   LED_SIGNAL           In a signal handler        N/C      GLOW     OFF
 *   LED_ASSERTION        An assertion failed        N/C      GLOW     OFF
 *   LED_PANIC            The system has crashed     N/C      N/C    Blinking
 *   LED_IDLE             MCU is is sleep mode       ------ Not used --------
 *
 * Thus if LED L is statically on, NuttX has successfully booted and is,
 * apparently, running normmally.  If LED RX is glowing, then NuttX is
 * handling interrupts (and also signals and assertions).  If TX is flashing
 * at approximately 2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system
