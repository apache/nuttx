README
======

  This README discusses issues unique to NuttX configurations for the
  Arduino DUE board featuring the Atmel ATSAM3X8E MCU running at 84 MHz.

  NOTE:  If found that newer Arduino Due board differ from the older boards
  mine:  Mine has the 32.768 slow clock crystal and associated caps installed.
  the newer boards do not.  This can cause a hang in the SAM startup code
  where it waits for the slow crystal input to lock on.

  Options:  (1) Solder a 32.768 KHz crystal and associated caps on board or,
  (2) disable the function sam_setupsupc() in sam_clockconfig.c

Rev 2 vs. Rev 3
===============

  This port was performed on the Arduino Due Rev 2 board.  NuttX users
  have reported issues with the serial port on his Arduino Due Rev 3 board.
  That problem was resolved as by configuring the UART0 RXD with a pull-up
  (see include/board.h).  That fix as well as any others that we may find
  will be enabled by selecting

    CONFIG_ARDUINO_DUE_REV3=y

ITEAD 2.4" TFT with Touch
=========================

  The Arduino 2.4" TFT Touch Shield is designed for all the Arduino
  compatible boards. It works in 3.3V voltage level. It can be directly
  plugged on the Arduino and other compatible boards. It will offer
  display, touch and storage functions for the Arduino board

  Features:

    1. Compatible with 3.3/5V operation voltage level
    2. Compatible with UTFT library
    3. With SD Card Socket

  The Arduino 2.4" TFT Touch shield uses the S6D1121 controller , it
  supports 8-bit data interface. The touch IC is XPT2046.

  NOTE:  When used with the ITEAD shield, the power from the USB connector
  seems to be inefficient (for example, I lose the USB connection when I
  insert an SD card).  I recommend using a 7-12V power supply with the
  Arduino in this case.

  NOTES:

  1. It is not possible to use any of the SPI devices on the Shield unless
     a bit-bang SPI interface is used.  This includes the touch controller
     a bit-bang SPI interface is used.  This includes the touch controller
     and the SD card.
  2. UART0 cannot be used.  USARTs on the COMM connector should be available.
  3. Parallel data is not contiguous in the PIO register
  4. Touchcontroller /CS pin is connected to ground (always selected).
  5. Either PA28 or PC29 may drive PWM10
  6. The schematics I have do not agree with the documentation.  The Touch IRQ
     and Dout pins are reversed in the Documentation (D9 an D8, respectively).
     I am assuming that the schematic is correct (and the schematic does seem
     to match up with what little I can see on the single visible side of the
     board).

Buttons and LEDs
================

  Buttons
  -------
  There are no buttons on the Arduino Due board.

  LEDs
  ----
  There are three user-controllable LEDs on board the Arduino Due board:

      LED              GPIO
      ---------------- -----
      L   Amber LED    PB27
      TX  Yellow LED   PA21
      RX  Yellow LED   PC30

  LED L is connected to ground and can be illuminated by driving the PB27
  output high. The TX and RX LEDs are pulled high and can be illuminated by
  driving the corresponding
  GPIO output to low.

  These LEDs are not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
  defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
  include/board.h and src/sam_leds.c. The LEDs are used to encode OS-related
  events as follows:

    SYMBOL                MEANING                         LED STATE
                                                    L         TX       RX
    -------------------  -----------------------  -------- -------- --------
    LED_STARTED          NuttX has been started     OFF      OFF      OFF
    LED_HEAPALLOCATE     Heap has been allocated    OFF      OFF      OFF
    LED_IRQSENABLED      Interrupts enabled         OFF      OFF      OFF
    LED_STACKCREATED     Idle stack created         ON       OFF      OFF
    LED_INIRQ            In an interrupt            N/C      GLOW     OFF
    LED_SIGNAL           In a signal handler        N/C      GLOW     OFF
    LED_ASSERTION        An assertion failed        N/C      GLOW     OFF
    LED_PANIC            The system has crashed     N/C      N/C      Blinking
    LED_IDLE             MCU is is sleep mode       ------ Not used --------

  Thus if LED L is statically on, NuttX has successfully booted and is,
  apparently, running normally.  If LED RX is glowing, then NuttX is
  handling interrupts (and also signals and assertions).  If TX is flashing
  at approximately 2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system
  has halted.

Serial Consoles
===============

  The SAM3X has a UART and 4 USARTS.  The Programming port uses a USB-to-
  serial chip connected to the first UART0 of the MCU (RX0 and TX0).  The
  output from that port is visible using the Arduino tool.

  Any of UART and USART0-3 may be used as a serial console.  By default,
  the UART is used as the serial console in all configurations.  But that is
  easily changed by modifying the configuration as described under
  "Configurations" below.

  Here are the UART signals available on pins.  Under signal name, the first
  column is the name on the schematic associated with the GPIO, the second
  comes from: http://arduino.cc/en/Hacking/PinMappingSAM3X, and the third
  is the name of the multiplexed SAM3X UART function from the data sheet.
  This is more than a little confusing.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    PIO              SIGNAL NAME                    CONNECTOR PIN
          DUE SCHEM. PIN MAPPING    SAM3X       DUE SCHEM. BOARD LABEL
    ----- ---------- -------------- ----------- ---------- -----------
    PA8   [U]RX      RX0            UART0  URXD  PWML 1    RX0<-0
    PA9   [U]TX      TX0            UART0  UTXD  PWML 2    TX0->1
    PD5   RXD0       RX3            USART3 RXD3  COMM 2    RX3
    PD4   TXD0       TX3            USART3 TXD3  COMM 1    TX3
    PA12  RXD1       RX2            USART1 RXD1  COMM 4    TX2
    PA13  TXD1       TX2            USART1 TXD1  COMM 3    RX2
    PA10  RXD2       RX1            USART0 RXD0  COMM 6    RX1
    PA11  TXD2       TX1            USART0 TXD0  COMM 5    TX1
    PB21  AD14(RXD3) Digital Pin 52 USART2 RXD2  XIO  33   33
    PB20  AD11(TXD3) Analog In 11   USART2 TXD2  ADCH 4    A11

  The outputs from these pins is 3.3V.  You will need to connect RS232
  transceiver to get the signals to RS232 levels (or connect to the
  USB virtual COM port in the case of UART0).

Loading Code
============

  [NOTE: I believe that there have been significant changes to the more
   recent tool environment such that Bossac may no longer be usable.  I
   don't know that for certain and perhaps someone with more knowledge of
   the tools than I could make this work.  See the Flip'n'Clip SAM3X README
   file for additional information.]

  Installing the Arduino USB Driver under Windows:
  ------------------------------------------------

  1. Download the Windows version of the Arduino software, not the 1.0.x
     release but the latest (1.5.x or later) that supports the Due. When
     the download finishes, unzip the downloaded file.

     In the current 1.8.x release, the Arduino Due support is not included
     in the base package but can be added by selecting the "Boards Manager"
     from the "Tools" menu.

  2. Connect the Due to your computer with a USB cable via the Programming
     port.

  3. The Windows driver installation should fail.

  4. Open the Device Manager

  5. Look for the listing named "Ports (COM & LPT)". You should see an open
     port named "Arduino Due Prog. Port".  Right click and select "Update
     driver".

  6. Select the "Browse my computer for Driver software" option.

  7. Right click on the "Arduino Due Prog. Port" and choose "Update Driver
     Software".

  8. Navigate to the folder with the Arduino IDE you downloaded and unzipped
     earlier. Locate and select the "Drivers" folder in the main Arduino folder
     (not the "FTDI USB Drivers" sub-directory).

  Loading NuttX to the Due Using Bossa:
  -------------------------------------

  Arduino uses BOSSA under the hood to load code and you can use BOSSA
  outside of Arduino.

  Where do you get it?

    Generic BOSSA installation files are available here:
    https://github.com/shumatech/BOSSA (formerly at
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/b-o-s-s-a/?source=dlp)

    Pre-built binaries are available: https://github.com/shumatech/BOSSA/releases

    The original Arduino DUE used a patched version of BOSSA available
    as source code here: https://github.com/shumatech/BOSSA/tree/arduino
    But that has most likely been incorporated into the main github
    repository.

    But, fortunately, since you already installed Arduino, you already have
    BOSSA installed.  In my installation, it is here:

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\arduino-1.5.2\hardware\tools\bossac.exe

  General Procedure

    1) Erase the FLASH and put the Due in bootloader mode
    2) Write the file to FLASH
    3) Configure to boot from FLASH
    4) Reset the DUE

  Erase FLASH and Put the Due in Bootloader Mode

    This is accomplished by simply configuring the programming port in 1200
    baud and sending something on the programming port.  Here is some sample
    output from a Windows CMD.exe shell.  NOTE that my Arduino programming
    port shows up as COM26.  It may be different on your system.

    To enter boot mode, set the baud to 1200 and send anything to the
    programming port:

      C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\arduino-1.5.2\hardware\tools>mode com26:1200,n,8,1

      Status for device COM26:

          Baud:            1200
          Parity:          None

  Writing FLASH and Setting FLASH Boot Mode
  -----------------------------------------
    In a Cygwin BaSH shell:

      export PATH="/cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/Arduino/arduino-1.5.2/hardware/tools":$PATH

    Erasing, writing, and verifying FLASH with bossac:

      $ bossac.exe --port=COM26 --usb-port=false -e -w -v -b nuttx.bin -R
      Erase flash
      Write 86588 bytes to flash
      [==============================] 100% (339/339 pages)
      Verify 86588 bytes of flash
      [==============================] 100% (339/339 pages)
      Verify successful
      Set boot flash true
      CPU reset.

    Some things that can go wrong:

      $ bossac.exe --port=COM26 --usb-port=false -e -w -v -b nuttx.bin -R
      No device found on COM26

    This error means that there is code running on the Due already so the
    bootloader cannot connect. Press reset and try again

      $ bossac.exe --port=COM26 --usb-port=false -e -w -v -b nuttx.bin -R
      No device found on COM26

    Sill No connection because Duo does not jump to bootloader after reset.
    Press ERASE button and try again

      $ bossac.exe --port=COM26 --usb-port=false -e -w -v -b nuttx.bin -R
      Erase flash
      Write 86588 bytes to flash
      [==============================] 100% (339/339 pages)
      Verify 86588 bytes of flash
      [==============================] 100% (339/339 pages)
      Verify successful
      Set boot flash true
      CPU reset.

  Other useful bossac operations.

    a) Write code to FLASH don't change boot mode and don't reset.  This lets
       you examine the FLASH contents that you just loaded while the bootloader
       is still active.

       $ bossac.exe --port=COM26 --usb-port=false -e -w -v --boot=0 nuttx.bin
       Write 64628 bytes to flash
       [==============================] 100% (253/253 pages)
       Verify 64628 bytes of flash
       [==============================] 100% (253/253 pages)
       Verify successful

    b) Verify the FLASH contents (the bootloader must be running)

       $ bossac.exe --port=COM26 --usb-port=false -v nuttx.bin
       Verify 64628 bytes of flash
       [==============================] 100% (253/253 pages)
       Verify successful

    c) Read from FLASH to a file  (the bootloader must be running):

       $ bossac.exe --port=COM26 --usb-port=false --read=4096 nuttx.dump
       Read 4096 bytes from flash
       [==============================] 100% (16/16 pages)

    d) Change to boot from FLASH

       $ bossac.exe --port=COM26 --usb-port=false --boot=1
       Set boot flash true

  Uploading NuttX to the Due Using JTAG
  -------------------------------------

  The JTAG/SWD signals are brought out to a 10-pin header JTAG connector:

   You should be able to use a 10- to 20-pin adapter to connect a SAM-ICE
   debugger to the Arduino Due.  I have this Olimex adapter:
   https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/ARM-JTAG-20-10/ . But so far I
   have been unable to get the get the SAM-ICE to communicate with the Due.

    CONFIG_SAM34_GPIOD_IRQ
    CONFIG_SAM34_GPIOE_IRQ
    CONFIG_SAM34_GPIOF_IRQ

Configurations
==============

  Each Arduino Due configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
  can be selected as follow:

    tools/configure.sh [OPTIONS] arduino-due:<subdir>

  Where typical options are -l to configure to build on Linux or -c to
  configure for Cygwin under Linux.  'tools/configure.sh -h' will show
  you all of the options.

  Before building, make sure the PATH environment variable includes the
  correct path to the directory than holds your toolchain binaries.

  And then build NuttX by simply typing the following.  At the conclusion of
  the make, the nuttx binary will reside in an ELF file called, simply, nuttx.

    make

  The <subdir> that is provided above as an argument to the tools/configure.sh
  must be is one of the following.

  NOTES:

  1. These configurations use the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
    change any of these configurations using that tool, you should:

    a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
       see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

    b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
       reconfiguration process.

  2. Unless stated otherwise, all configurations generate console
     output on UART0 which is available both on the USB virtual COM port
     and on the PWML connector (see the section "Serial Consoles" above).

     However, the pin usage by the ITEAD TFT shield conflict with the pin
     usage for UART0.  In this case you need to switch to USART0 by
     modifying the configuration as follows:

       Board Selection -> Peripheral
         CONFIG_SAM34_UART0=n              : Disable UART0.  Can't use with this shield
         CONFIG_SAM34_USART0=y             : Enable USART0
         CONFIG_USART0_SERIALDRIVER=y

       Device Drivers -> Serial
         CONFIG_USART0_SERIAL_CONSOLE=y    : Configure the console on USART0
         CONFIG_USART0_RXBUFSIZE=256
         CONFIG_USART0_TXBUFSIZE=256
         CONFIG_USART0_BAUD=115200
         CONFIG_USART0_BITS=8
         CONFIG_USART0_PARITY=0
         CONFIG_USART0_2STOP=0

     NOTE: USART0 TTL levels are available on COMM 5 (TXD0) and COMM 6 (RXD0).

  3. Unless otherwise stated, the configurations are setup for
     Linux (or any other POSIX environment like Cygwin under Windows):

     Build Setup:
       CONFIG_HOST_LINUX=y   : Linux or other POSIX environment

  4. These configurations use the older, OABI, buildroot toolchain.  But
     that is easily reconfigured:

     System Type -> Toolchain:
       CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT=y : Buildroot toolchain
       CONFIG_ARMV7M_OABI_TOOLCHAIN=y      : Older, OABI toolchain

     If you want to use the Atmel GCC toolchain, here are the steps to
     do so:

     Build Setup:
       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y   : Windows
       CONFIG_HOST_CYGWIN=y    : Using Cygwin or other POSIX environment

     System Type -> Toolchain:
       CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y : General GCC EABI toolchain under windows

     This re-configuration should be done before making NuttX or else the
     subsequent 'make' will fail.  If you have already attempted building
     NuttX then you will have to 1) 'make distclean' to remove the old
     configuration, 2) 'tools/configure.sh sam3u-ek/ksnh' to start
     with a fresh configuration, and 3) perform the configuration changes
     above.

     Also, make sure that your PATH variable has the new path to your
     Atmel tools.  Try 'which arm-none-eabi-gcc' to make sure that you
     are selecting the right tool.

Configuration sub-directories
-----------------------------

  nsh:
    This configuration directory will build the NuttShell.  See NOTES above.

    NOTES:
    1. NSH built-in applications are supported.  However, there are
       no built-in applications built with the default configuration.

       Binary Formats:
         CONFIG_BUILTIN=y                    : Enable support for built-in programs

       Application Configuration:
         CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS=y           : Enable starting apps from NSH command line

    2. By default, this configuration uses UART0 and has support LEDs
       enabled.  UART0 output is available on the USB debugging port or
       on pins 0-1 of the PWML connector.

       This configuration can be modified to use peripherals on the ITEAD
       TFT shield as described below.  However, in that case the UART0 and
       LED "L" GPIO pins conflict with the pin usage by the ITEAD TFT
       Shield.  In this case you need to switch to USART0 and disable LEDs
       by modifying the configuration as follows:

       Board Selection -> Peripheral
         CONFIG_SAM34_UART0=n              : Disable UART0.  Can't use with this shield
         CONFIG_SAM34_USART0=y             : Enable USART0
         CONFIG_USART0_SERIALDRIVER=y

       Device Drivers -> Serial
         CONFIG_USART0_SERIAL_CONSOLE=y    : Configure the console on USART0
         CONFIG_USART0_RXBUFSIZE=256
         CONFIG_USART0_TXBUFSIZE=256
         CONFIG_USART0_BAUD=115200
         CONFIG_USART0_BITS=8
         CONFIG_USART0_PARITY=0
         CONFIG_USART0_2STOP=0

         NOTE: USART0 TTL levels are available on COMM 5 (TXD0) and
         COMM 6 (RXD0)

       Board Selection -> Board-Specific Options:
         CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS=n                : Can't support LEDs with this shield installed
         CONFIG_ARDUINO_ITHEAD_TFT=y       : Enable support for the Shield

    3. If the ITEAD TFT shield is connected to the Arduino Due, then
       support for the SD card slot can be enabled by making the following
       changes to the configuration:

       NOTE: You cannot use UART0 or LEDs with this ITEAD module.  You must
       switch to USART0 and disable LED support as described above.

       Board Selection -> Board-Specific Options:
         CONFIG_ARDUINO_ITHEAD_TFT=y       : Enable support for the Shield

       File Systems:
         CONFIG_DISABLE_MOUNTPOINT=n       : Mountpoint support is needed
         CONFIG_FS_FAT=y                   : Enable the FAT file system
         CONFIG_FAT_LCNAMES=y              : Enable upper/lower case 8.3 file names (Optional, see below)
         CONFIG_FAT_LFN=y                  : Enable long file named (Optional, see below)
         CONFIG_FAT_MAXFNAME=32            : Maximum supported file name length

         There are issues related to patents that Microsoft holds on FAT long
         file name technologies.  See the top level NOTICE file for further
         details.

         CONFIG_NSH_MMCSDSLOTNO=0          : Only one MMC/SD slot, slot 0
         CONFIG_NSH_MMCSDSPIPORTNO=0       : (does not really matter in this case)

       Application Configuration -> NSH Library
         CONFIG_NSH_ARCHINIT=y             : Board has architecture-specific initialization

    3. This configuration has been used for verifying the touchscreen on
       on the ITEAD TFT Shield.  With the modifications below, you can
       include the touchscreen test program at apps/examples/touchscreen as
       an NSH built-in application.  You can enable the touchscreen and test
       by modifying the  default configuration in the following ways:

       NOTE: You cannot use UART0 or LEDs with this ITEAD module.  You must
       switch to USART0 and disable LED support as described above.

       Board Selection -> Board-Specific Options:
         CONFIG_ARDUINO_ITHEAD_TFT=y       : Enable support for the Shield
