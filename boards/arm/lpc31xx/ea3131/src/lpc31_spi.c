 * Name:  lpc31_spiselect and lpc31_spistatus
 *
 * Description:
 *   The external functions, lpc31_spiselect and lpc31_spistatus must be
 *   provided by board-specific logic. They are implementations of the select
 *   and status methods of the SPI interface defined by struct spi_ops_s (see
 *   include/nuttx/spi/spi.h).
 *   All other methods (including lpc31_spibus_initialize())
 *   are provided by common LPC31XX logic.
 *   To use this common SPI logic on your board:
 *
 *   1. Provide logic in lpc31_boardinitialize() to configure SPI chip select
 *      pins.
 *   2. Provide lpc31_spiselect() and lpc31_spistatus() functions in your
 *      board-specific logic. These functions will perform chip selection and
 *      status operations using GPIOs in the way your board is configured.
 *   3. Add a calls to lpc31_spibus_initialize() in your low level
 *      application initialization logic
 *   4. The handle returned by lpc31_spibus_initialize() may then be used to
 *      bind the SPI driver to higher level logic (e.g., calling
 *      mmcsd_spislotinitialize(), for example, will bind the SPI driver to
 *      the SPI MMC/SD driver).
