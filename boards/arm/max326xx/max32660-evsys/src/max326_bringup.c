 * Name: max326_bringup
 *
 * Description:
 *   Bring up board features.
 *
 *   If CONFIG_BOARD_LATE_INITIALIZE=y, then this function will be called
 *   from board_late_initialize().
 *
 *   If CONFIG_BOARD_LATE_INITIALIZE is not selected,
 *   but CONFIG_LIB_BOARDCTL=y
 *   then this function will *probably* be called from application logic via
 *   boardctl().
 *
 *   Otherwise, this function will not be called (which is usually a bad
 *   thing)
