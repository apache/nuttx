/* The NuTiny has a single green LED that can be controlled from software.
 * This LED is connected to PIN17.  It is pulled high so a low value will
 * illuminate the LED.
 *
 * If CONFIG_ARCH_LEDs is defined, then NuttX will control the LED on board
 * the NuTiny.
 * The following definitions describe how NuttX controls the LEDs:
 *
 *   SYMBOL                Meaning                 LED state
 *                                                 Initially all LED is OFF
 *   -------------------  -----------------------  ------------- ------------
 *   LED_STARTED          NuttX has been started   LED ON
 *   LED_HEAPALLOCATE     Heap has been allocated  LED ON
 *   LED_IRQSENABLED      Interrupts enabled       LED ON
 *   LED_STACKCREATED     Idle stack created       LED ON
 *   LED_INIRQ            In an interrupt          LED should glow
 *   LED_SIGNAL           In a signal handler      LED might glow
 *   LED_ASSERTION        An assertion failed      LED ON while handling the
 *                                                        assertion
 *   LED_PANIC            The system has crashed   LED Blinking at 2Hz
 *   LED_IDLE             NUC1XX is is sleep mode   (Optional, not used)
