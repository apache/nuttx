Status
======

  Oct 2022: initial nsh configuration. LCD seems working.

Programming
===========

  The device can be normally flashing and debugging over SWD interface or flashing via
  USB interface when the device is in DFU mode using STMicro's STM32CubeProgrammer. The
  DFU mode will be activated after pressing two round button for 30s. Original firmware
  can be flashed back and stay working until the secure flash area is not changed.

Serial Console
==============

  The MCU's USART1 PB6/PB7 pins are available as external GPIO pins 13/14.

Configurations
==============

  nsh:

    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at examples/nsh.  This
    configuration is focused on low level, command-line driver testing.
