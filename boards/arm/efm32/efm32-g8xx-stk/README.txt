STATUS
======

  2014-10-28.  At this point all basic boot operations are successful:  The
    LEDs work and the application tasks appear to be successfully started.
    LED2 is on and LED0 is glowing (meaning that interrupts are being
    processed).  However, I get no output on PE0.  Data appears to be sent
    (at least by efm32_lowputc()).  However, no signal activity is present
    on PE0.

  2014-10-29:  The NuttX is running on the EFM32 Gecko Starter Kit.  There
    are not many peripherals to test in that configuration, but the NuttShell
    (NSH) is working over LEUART0 at 2400 baud (certainly that could go up
    to 4800.  The documentation says that 9600 is also possible on the
    LEUART, but I am not sure how).

    I originally planned to use UART0 at 115200 baud, but I never could get
    any output from the board.  I reviewd my pin configuration and clocking
    carefully and the USART seems to think it is working correctly.  So I
    am thinking that there is some board issue that prohibits that option
    (probably because UART0 is used with the board controller???).  Pins
    are not available for other U[S]ARTs on the board.

    DMA and USART-based SPI supported are included, but not yet tested.

  2014-10-29:  Calibrated the delays loops.

  2014-10-29:  The start-up time is long -- about a second.  I have traced
    this to the default delay in bringing up the LFCLK in efm32_clockconfig.
    The default, reset setting of the LFXOTIMEOUT field of the CMU_CTRL
    register is 3 which corresponds to a delay of 32768 cycles, or a full
    second.  I have not experimented to see if this delay can be reduced.

LEDs
====

  The EFM32 Gecko Start Kit has four yellow LEDs.  These LEDs are connected
  as follows:

  ------------------------------------- --------------------
  EFM32 PIN                             BOARD SIGNALS
  ------------------------------------- --------------------
  C0/USART1_TX#0/PCNT0_S0IN#2/ACMP0_CH0  MCU_PC0  UIF_LED0
  C1/USART1_RX#0/PCNT0_S1IN#2/ACMP0_CH1  MCU_PC1  UIF_LED1
  C2/USART2_TX#0/ACMP0_CH2               MCU_PC2  UIF_LED2
  C3/USART2_RX#0/ACMP0_CH3               MCU_PC3  UIF_LED3
  ------------------------------------- --------------------

  All LEDs are grounded and so are illuminated by outputting a high
  value to the LED.

  These LEDs are not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
  defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
  include/board.h and src/efm32_autoleds.c.  The LEDs are used to
  encode OS-related events as follows:

    SYMBOL             Meaning                 LED0*  LED1   LED2   LED3
    ----------------- -----------------------  ------ -----  -----  ------
    LED_STARTED       NuttX has been started   ON     OFF    OFF    OFF
    LED_HEAPALLOCATE  Heap has been allocated  OFF    ON     OFF    OFF
    LED_IRQSENABLED   Interrupts enabled       ON     ON     OFF    OFF
    LED_STACKCREATED  Idle stack created       OFF    OFF    ON     OFF
    LED_INIRQ         In an interrupt**        ON     N/C    N/C    OFF
    LED_SIGNAL        In a signal handler***   N/C    ON     N/C    OFF
    LED_ASSERTION     An assertion failed      ON     ON     N/C    OFF
    LED_PANIC         The system has crashed   N/C    N/C    N/C    ON
    LED_IDLE          STM32 is is sleep mode   (Optional, not used)

  * If LED0, LED1, LED2 are statically on, then NuttX probably failed to boot
    and these LEDs will give you some indication of where the failure was
 ** The normal state is LED2 ON and LED3 faintly glowing.  This faint glow
    is because of timer interrupt that result in the LED being illuminated
    on a small proportion of the time.
*** LED1 may also flicker normally if signals are processed.

SERIAL CONSOLE
==============

  Pin Availability
  ----------------
  The EFM32G890F128 support the following options for serial output.  NOTE
  (1) that not all of these pins are available for use as a serial console,
  however.  And (2) not all pins made available by the board.

   Default Serial Console
   ----------------------
   LEUART0 is configured as the default serial console at 2400 8N1
   on pins PD5 and PD4.  It certainly be possible to go to 4800 baud
   and the documentation claims that 9600 baud is possible (although
   I am not sure how).

   It should also be possible to use UART0 is configured at 115200 8N1
   on pins PE0 and PE1.  However, my attempts to use USART0 were
   unsuccessful -- I see no activity on PE0 and PE1 and have not yet
   figured out why that is.

   Communication through the Board Controller
   ------------------------------------------
   The control MCU acts as a board controller (BC). There is a UART
   connection between the EFM and the BC. The connection is made by
   setting the EFM_BC_EN (PD13) line high. The EFM can then use the BSP to
   send commands to the BC. When EFM_BC_EN is low, EFM_BC_TX and EFM_BC_RX
   can be used by other applications.

USING THE J-LINK GDB SERVER
===========================

   1. Star the J-Link GDB server.  You should see the start-up configuration
      window.  SelectL

      a. Target device = EFM32G880F128
      b. Select Target interface = SWD

   2. Press OK.  The GDB server should start and the last message in the Log
      output should be "Waiting for GDB connection".

   3. In a terminal window, start GDB:

      arm-none-eabi-gdb

   4. Connect to the J-Link GDB server:

     (gdb) target remote localhost:2331

   5. Load and run nuttx

     (gdb) mon halt
     (gdb) load nuttx
     (gdb) mon reset go

   I had to tinker with the setup a few times repeating the same steps above
   before things finally began to work.  Don't know why.

   To debug code already burned into FLASH:

   1. Start the GDB server as above.

   2. In a terminal window, start GDB:

      arm-none-eabi-gdb

   3. Connect to the J-Link GDB serer:

     (gdb) target remote local host

   3. Load the nuttx symbol file, reset, and debug

     (gdb) mon halt
     (gdb) file nuttx
     (gdb) mon reset
     (gdb) s
     ...

CONFIGURATIONS
==============

  Each EFM32 Gecko Starter Kit configuration is maintained in a sub-directory
  and can be selected as follow:

    tools/configure.sh efm32-g8xx-stk:<subdir>

  If this is a Windows native build, then configure.bat should be used
  instead of configure.sh:

    configure.bat efm32-g8xx-stk\<subdir>

  Where <subdir> is one of the following:

  nsh:
  ---
    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at apps/examples/nsh.  The
    Configuration enables the serial interfaces on LEUART0 at 2400 8N1.

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
       change this configuration using that tool, you should:

       a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
          see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

       b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.

    2. By default, this configuration uses the ARM EABI toolchain
       for Windows and builds under Cygwin (or probably MSYS).  That
       can easily be reconfigured, of course.

       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y                   : Builds under Windows
       CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y                 : Using Cygwin
       CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y     : GNU EABI toolchain for Windows
