/* AUXCLK - Auxiliary Clock
 *
 * AUXCLK is a 1-28 MHz clock driven by a separate RC oscillator, AUXHFRCO.
 * This clock is used for flash programming and Serial Wire Output (SWO).
 * During flash programming this clock will be active. If the AUXHFRCO has
 * not been enabled explicitly by software, the MSC will automatically
 * start and stop it. The AUXHFRCO is enabled by writing a 1 to AUXHFRCOEN
 * in CMU_OSCENCMD. This explicit enabling is required when SWO is used.
