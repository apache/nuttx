    • Four user buttons
    • Buzzer
    • On-board voltage regulator 3.3V with up to 800mA current
    • Power supply filtering capacitor
    • Extension headers for some of the uC ports + RST and power supply

STATUS
======

  I created this configuration with good intentions but was stopped because
  I do not have a SWD tool that I can use with the board -- and I am not
  likely to get one soon.

LEDs
====

  The EFM32G880F128-STK has no user controllable LEDs.

Buttons
=======

  The Olimex board has four buttons, BUT1-4.  Each is grounded and so should
  have a weak pull-up so that it will be sensed as "1" when open and "0"
  when closed.

Serial Console
==============

  Pin Availability
  ----------------
  The EFM32G890F128 support the following options for serial output.  NOTE
  (1) that not all of these pins are available for use as a serial console,
  however.  And (2) not all pins made available by the board.

   RS-232 Driver/DB-9 Connector
   ----------------------------
   LEUART1 is available on through an RS232 driver on DB-9 connector.
   Unfortunately, there is no LEUART serial driver available in NuttX as of
   this writing.

   Default Serial Console
   ----------------------
   LEUART1 is configured as the default serial console at 2400 8N1
   on pins PC6 and PC7.

Configurations
==============
  Each EFM32G880F128-STK configuration is maintained in a sub-director
  and can be selected as follow:

    tools/configure.sh olimex-efm32g880f128-stk:<subdir>

  Where <subdir> is one of the following:

  nsh:
  ---
    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at apps/examples/nsh.  The
    Configuration enables the serial interfaces on LEUART1.  Support for
    builtin applications is enabled, but in the base configuration no
    builtin applications are selected (see NOTES below).

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
       change this configuration using that tool, you should:

       a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
          see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

       b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.

    2. By default, this configuration uses the ARM EABI toolchain
       for Windows and builds under Cygwin (or probably MSYS).  That
       can easily be reconfigured, of course.

       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y                   : Builds under Windows
       CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y                 : Using Cygwin
       CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y     : GNU EABI toolchain for Windows
