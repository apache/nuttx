 * Name: board_late_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   If CONFIG_BOARD_LATE_INITIALIZE is selected, then an additional
 *   initialization call will be performed in the boot-up sequence to a
 *   function called board_late_initialize().  board_late_initialize() will be
 *   called immediately after up_intitialize() is called and just before the
 *   initial application is started.  This additional initialization phase
 *   may be used, for example, to initialize board-specific device drivers.
