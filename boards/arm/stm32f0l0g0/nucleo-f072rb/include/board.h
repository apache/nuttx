/* Clocking *****************************************************************/

/* Four different clock sources can be used to drive the system clock
 * (SYSCLK):
 *
 * - HSI high-speed internal oscillator clock
 *   Generated from an internal 8 MHz RC oscillator
 * - HSE high-speed external oscillator clock
 *   Normally driven by an external crystal (X3).  However, this crystal is
 *   not fitted on the Nucleo-F072RB board.
 * - PLL clock
 * - MSI multispeed internal oscillator clock
 *   The MSI clock signal is generated from an internal RC oscillator. Seven
 *   frequency ranges are available: 65.536 kHz, 131.072 kHz, 262.144 kHz,
 *   524.288 kHz, 1.048 MHz, 2.097 MHz (default value) and 4.194 MHz.
 *
 * The devices have the following two secondary clock sources
 * - LSI low-speed internal RC clock
 *   Drives the watchdog and RTC.  Approximately 37KHz
 * - LSE low-speed external oscillator clock
 *   Driven by 32.768KHz crystal (X2) on the OSC32_IN and OSC32_OUT pins.

/* PLL Configuration
 *
 *   - PLL source is HSI       -> 8MHz input (nominal)
 *   - PLL source predivider 2 -> 4MHz divided down PLL VCO clock output
 *   - PLL multipler is 12     -> 48MHz PLL VCO clock output (for USB)
 *
 * Resulting SYSCLK frequency is 8MHz x 12 / 2 = 48MHz
 *
 * USB:
 *   If the USB interface is used in the application, it requires a precise
 *   48MHz clock which can be generated from either the (1) the internal
 *   main PLL with the HSE clock source using an HSE crystal oscillator.  In
 *   this case,  the PLL VCO clock (defined by STM32_CFGR_PLLMUL) must be
 *   programmed to output a 96 MHz frequency. This is required to provide a
 *   48MHz clock to the (USBCLK = PLLVCO/2).  Or (2) by using the internal
 *   48MHz oscillator in automatic trimming mode. The synchronization for
 *   this oscillator can be taken from the USB data stream itself (SOF
 *   signalization) which allows crystal-less operation.
 * SYSCLK
 *   The system clock is derived from the PLL VCO divided by the output
 *   division factor.
 * Limitations:
 *   - 96 MHz as PLLVCO when the product is in range 1 (1.8V),
 *   - 48 MHz as PLLVCO when the product is in range 2 (1.5V),
 *   - 24 MHz when the product is in range 3 (1.2V).
 *   - Output division to avoid exceeding 32 MHz as SYSCLK.
 *   - The minimum input clock frequency for PLL is 2 MHz (when using HSE as
 *     PLL source).
