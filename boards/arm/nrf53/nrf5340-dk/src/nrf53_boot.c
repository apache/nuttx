 * Name: nrf53_board_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   All NRF53xxx architectures must provide the following entry point.
 *   This entry point is called early in the initialization -- after all
 *   memory has been configured and mapped but before any devices have been
 *   initialized.
 *

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: board_late_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   If CONFIG_BOARD_LATE_INITIALIZE is selected, then an additional
 *   initialization call will be performed in the boot-up sequence to a
 *   function called board_late_initialize(). board_late_initialize() will be
 *   called immediately after up_initialize() is called and just before the
 *   initial application is started.  This additional initialization phase
 *   may be used, for example, to initialize board-specific device drivers.
