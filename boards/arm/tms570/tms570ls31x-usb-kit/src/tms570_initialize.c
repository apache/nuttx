 * Name: tms570_boardinitialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   All TMS570 architectures must provide the following entry point.  This
 *   function is called near the beginning of _start.  This function is
 *   called after clocking has been configured but before caches have been
 *   enabled and before any devices have been initialized.  .data/.bss
 *   memory may or may not have been initialized (see the "special
 *   precautions" below).
 *
 *   This function must perform low level initialization including
 *
 *   - Initialization of board-specific memory resources (e.g., SDRAM)
 *   - Configuration of board specific resources (GPIOs, LEDs, etc).
 *   - Setup of the console UART.  This UART done early so that the serial
 *     console is available for debugging very early in the boot sequence.
 *
 *   Special precautions must be taken if .data/.bss lie in SRAM.  in that
 *   case, the boot logic cannot initialize .data or .bss.  The function
 *   must then:
 *
 *   - Take precautions to assume that logic does not access any global
 *     data that might lie in SDRAM.
 *   - Call the function arm_data_initialize() as soon as SDRAM has been
 *     properly configured for use.
