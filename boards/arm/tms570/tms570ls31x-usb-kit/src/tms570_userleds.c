/* LEDs
 *
 * The launchpad has several LEDs:
 *
 *   - LEd D1 (white) that connects to the USB +5V supply,
 *   - LED D10 (red) that connects to the TMS570's NERROR pin,
 *   - D5 (blue), D6 (blue), and D8 (blue) connect to the XDS100 FT2322,
 *   - D7 (blue) connects to the XSD100 CPLD, and
 *   - Two white, user LEDs labeled D12 that connects to the NHET08
 *     pin and D11 that connects to GIOA2.
 *
 * NHET08 is one of 32 N2HET pins than can be available to the user if
 * not used by N2HET.  This implementation, however, uses only the single
 * LED driven by GIOA2.  That LED is tied to ground and illuminated
 * with a high level output value.
