/* LEDs
 *
 * The launchpad has several LEDs:
 *
 *   - LEd D1 (white) that connects to the USB +5V supply,
 *   - LED D10 (red) that connects to the TMS570's NERROR pin,
 *   - D5 (blue), D6 (blue), and D8 (blue) connect to the XDS100 FT2322,
 *   - D7 (blue) connects to the XSD100 CPLD, and
 *   - Two white, user LEDs labeled D12 that connects to the NHET08
 *     pin and D11 that connects to GIOA2.
 *
 * NHET08 is one of 32 N2HET pins than can be available to the user if
 * not used by N2HET.  This implementation, however, uses only the single
 * LED driven by GIOA2.  That LED is tied to ground and illuminated
 * with a high level output value.
 *
 * This LED is not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
 * defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
 * include/board.h and src/tms570_autoleds.c. The LED is used to encode
 * OS-related events as follows:
 *
 *   ------------------- ----------------------- ------
 *   SYMBOL              Meaning                 LED
 *   ------------------- ----------------------- ------
 *   LED_STARTED         NuttX has been started  OFF
 *   LED_HEAPALLOCATE    Heap has been allocated OFF
 *   LED_IRQSENABLED     Interrupts enabled      OFF
 *   LED_STACKCREATED    Idle stack created      ON
 *   LED_INIRQ           In an interrupt         N/C
 *   LED_SIGNAL          In a signal handler     N/C
 *   LED_ASSERTION       An assertion failed     N/C
 *   LED_PANIC           The system has crashed  FLASH
 *
 * Thus if the LED is statically on, NuttX has successfully  booted and is,
 * apparently, running normally.  If the LED is flashing at approximately
 * 2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system has halted.
