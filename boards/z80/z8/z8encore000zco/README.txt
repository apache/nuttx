ZDS-II Compiler Versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 4.10.1
  NuttX builds successfully with the 4.10.1 compiler.

Version 4.9.5
  This is the latest tool version listed on the ZiLOG site for the Z8F6403.
  However, it uses different compiler command line arguments.

Version 5.0.0

  On November 28, 2012, all of the z8 configurations were converted to use 5.0.0,
  but have not been verified on a running target.

  Paths were also updated that are specific to a 32-bit toolchain running on
  a 64 bit windows platform.  Change to a different toolchain, you will need
  to modify the versioning in the Make.defs file; if you want to build
  on a different platform, you will need to change the path in the ZDS binaries
  in those that file and also in your patch variable.

Other Versions
  If you use any version of ZDS-II other than 5.0.0 or if you install ZDS-II
  at any location other than the default location, you will have to modify
  the boards/z80/z8/z8encore000zco/*/Make.defs file and your PATH environment
  variable.

Configuration Subdirectories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- src/ and include/
    These directories contain common logic for all z8encore000zco
    configurations.

Variations on the basic z8encore000zco configuration are maintained
in subdirectories.  To configure any specific configuration, do the
following steps:

   tools/configure.sh z8encore000zco:<sub-directory>
   make

Where <sub-directory> is the specific board configuration that you
wish to build.  The following board-specific configurations are
available:

- ostest
    This builds the examples/ostest application for execution from FLASH.
    See examples/README.txt for information about ostest.

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
       change this configuration using that tool, you should:

       a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
          see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

       b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.

    2. By default, this configuration assumes that you are using the
       Cygwin environment on Windows.  An option is to use the native
       CMD.exe window build as described in the top-level README.txt
       file.  To set up that configuration:

       -CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y
       +CONFIG_WINDOWS_NATIVE=y

       And after configuring, make sure that CONFIG_APPS_DIR uses
       the back slash character.  For example:

        CONFIG_APPS_DIR="..\apps"

      NOTES:

      a. If you need to change the toolchain path used in Make.defs, you
         will need to use the short 8.3 filenames to avoid spaces.  On my
         PC, C:\PROGRA~1\ is is C:\Program Files\ and C:\PROGRA~2\ is
         C:\Program Files (x86)\
      b. At present, the native Windows build fails at the final link stages.
         The failure is due to problems in arch/z80/src/nuttx.linkcmd that
         is autogenerated by arch/z80/src/Makefile.zdsii.  The basic problem
         is the spurious spaces and and carrirage returns are generated at
         the end of the lines after a line continuation (\ ^M).  If these
         trailing bad characters are manually eliminated, then the build
         will succeed on the next try.

Check out any README.txt files in these <sub-directory>s.
