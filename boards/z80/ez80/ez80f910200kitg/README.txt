ZDS-II Compiler Versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Different configurations have been build for this board using ZDS-11
Versions 4.11.0, 4.11.1, and 5.1.1  You have to check the files */Make.defs
to see how the build is configured:  Check the definitions of
ZDSVERSION (if present) and ZDSINSTALLDIR.

NOTE:  Different versions of the ZDS-II compiler may also require
different versions of .linkcmd and .zdsproj files as well.

Version 5.3.3

  As of this writing, this is the latest version available.

Version 4.11.0

  The 5.3.3 version of the ZDS-II tools is the default configured for
  all ez80 boards.  However, it is the older version 4.11.0 that this code
  has been verified against.

Version 5.1.1

  On June 22, 2011 I verified that these configurations build successfully
  with the 5.1.1 ZDS-II version.  On November 12, 2012, all of the configurations
  were converted to use 5.1.1, but have not been verified on a running target.

  The above kludge for 4.11.0 is not required with 5.1.1.

  Paths were also updated that are specific to a 32-bit toolchain running on
  a 64 bit windows platform.  Change to a different toolchain, you will need
  to modify the versioning in Make.defs; if you want to build on a different
  platform, you will need to change the path in the ZDS binaries in that files
  and also in your PATH environment variable.

Version 5.2.1

  On January 31, 2016, I tried ZDS-II version 5.2.1.  I believe that I have
  all of the changes in place to support that version.  At compile time,
  however, I encountered compiler internal errors.  I did not pursue that
  build any further.

Version 5.3.0

  I verified compilation using 5.30 on June 2, 2019.  To use this version,
  I had to make spurious modification to the implementation of gmtimer() to
  work around an internal compiler error.  I have still not verified that
  are no errors in the compiled code.

Other Versions
  If you use any version of ZDS-II other than 5.1.1, 5.2.1, or 5.3.0 or
  if you install ZDS-II at any location other than the default location,
  you will have to modify three files:  (1) arch/arm/z80/src/ez80/Kconfig,
  (2) boards/z80/ez80/ez80f910200kitg/scripts/Make.defs and, perhaps, (3)
  arch/z80/src/ez80/Toolchain.defs.

Configuration Subdirectories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- src/ and include/
    These directories contain common logic for all ez80f910200kitg
    configurations.

Variations on the basic ez80f910200kitg configuration are maintained
in subdirectories.  To configure any specific configuration, do the
following steps:

   tools/configure.sh ez80f910200kitg:<sub-directory>
   make

Where <sub-directory> is the specific board configuration that you
wish to build.  The following board-specific configurations are
available:

- ostest
    This builds the examples/ostest application for execution from FLASH.
    See examples/README.txt for information about ostest.

    NOTES:

    1. This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
       change this configuration using that tool, you should:

       a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
          see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

       b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
          reconfiguration process.

    2. By default, this configuration assumes that you are using the
       Cygwin environment on Windows.  An option is to use the native
       CMD.exe window build as described in the top-level README.txt
       file.  To set up that configuration:

       -CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y
       +CONFIG_WINDOWS_NATIVE=y

       And after configuring, make sure that CONFIG_APPS_DIR uses
       the back slash character.  For example:

        CONFIG_APPS_DIR="..\apps"

      NOTES:

      a. If you need to change the toolchain path used in Make.defs, you
         will need to use the short 8.3 filenames to avoid spaces.  On my
         PC, C:\PROGRA~1\ is is C:\Program Files\ and C:\PROGRA~2\ is
         C:\Program Files (x86)\
      b. At present, the native Windows build fails at the final link stages.
         The failure is due to problems in arch/z80/src/nuttx.linkcmd that
         is autogenerated by arch/z80/src/Makefile.zdsii.  The basic problem
         is the spurious spaces and and carrirage returns are generated at
         the end of the lines after a line continuation (\ ^M).  If these
         trailing bad characters are manually eliminated, then the build
         will succeed on the next try.

Check out any README.txt files in these <sub-directory>s.
