P112 README
===========

The P112 is notable because it was the first of the hobbyist single board
computers to reach the production stage. The P112 hobbyist computers
were relatively widespread and inspired other hobbyist centered home brew
computing projects such as N8VEM home brew computing project. The P112
project still maintains many devoted enthusiasts and has an online
repository of software and other information.

The P112 computer originated as a commercial product of "D-X Designs Pty
Ltd" of Australia. They describe the computer as "The P112 is a stand-alone
8-bit CPU board. Typically running CP/M (tm) or a similar operating system,
it provides a Z80182 (Z-80 upgrade) CPU with up to 1MB of memory, serial,
parallel and diskette IO, and realtime clock, in a 3.5-inch drive form factor.
Powered solely from 5V, it draws 150mA (nominal: not including disk drives)
with a 16MHz CPU clock. Clock speeds up to 24.576MHz are possible."

The P112 board was last available new in 1996 by Dave Brooks. In late 2004
on the Usenet Newsgroup comp.os.cpm, talk about making another run of P112
boards was discussed. David Griffith decided to produce additional P112 kits
with Dave Brooks blessing and the assistance of others. In addition Terry
Gulczynski makes additional P112 derivative hobbyist home brew computers.
Hal Bower was very active in the mid 1990's on the P112 project and ported
the "Banked/Portable BIOS".

Dave Griffith was successfully funded through Kickstarter for another run
of P112 boards in November of 2012.

Pin Configuration
=================

The P112 is based on the 5V Z8018216FSG running at 16MHz.  The Z8018216FSG
comes in a 100-pin QFP package:

P112 Serial Console
===================

The UARTs are not used on the P112 board (the UART signals are available
off-board through P14).  The serial console is provided by U7 LT1133,
Advanced Low Power 5V RS232 Driver/Receiver that connects to the P112 via
the Z85230 ESCC channel A.

Status
======

2020-4-11:  Support for CONFIG_CAN_PASS_STRUCTS was removed in NuttX-9.1.
  This was necessary to enforce some POSIX interface compliance but also
  means that ALL older SDCC versions will no long build with NuttX.  I have
  been told that the newest SDCC compilers can indeed pass structure and
  union parameters and return values.  If that is correct, then perhaps
  the newer SDCC compilers will be used.  Otherwise, it will be necessary
  to use some other, more compliant compiler.

2014-8-22:  After some time idling away, I tried rebuilding with Windows 8,
  the latest MinGW and the latest SDCC.  I fixed a few things but there a
  still a few issues.  The last "show stopper" before I gave up for now was
  during building dependencies:

  ASlink-Error-<cannot open> : "bin/mm_initialize.rel"

  Clearly there is something wrong with the command line options given to
  SDCC because it is trying to compile and link when we really only want
  dependencies.  I did not spend very much time trying to solve the problem;
  I assume that it is not too difficult.

2014-9-15: There has been a lot of change to the address environment APIs
  with the integration of address environments on the Cortex-A.  It is
  likely that there is some breakage due to incompatibilities with the
  Z180's mini-MMU.

Known compilation problems with SDCC:
