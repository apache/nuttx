This README discusses issues unique to NuttX configurations for the
OPEN ISA RV32M1-VEGA development board featuring the RV32M1 MCU. The
RV32M1 is a heterogeneous soc including an ARM Cortex-M4 CPU, an ARM 
Cortex-M0+ CPU, a RISC-V RI5CY CPU, and a RISC-V ZERO_RISCY CPU. the
SOC integrates 1.25 MB flash, 384 KB SRAM, and varieties of peripherals.
The RV32M1-VEGA board features:

  - On-board OpenSDA Debug Adapter,
  - USB Device Port,
  - FXOS8700CQ Digital Combo Sensor: 3D Accelerometer + 3D Magnetometer,
  - Wirless Abilities: BLE, Generic FSK, and IEEE Std.802.15.4(Thread),
  - ONE user RGB LED,
  - Four user push-buttons,
  - 4 MB external SPI Flash,
  - Micro-SD Card Slot on the backside,
  - Arduino R3 Compatible IO Header.

Refer to https://open-isa.org for further information about this board.

Currently NuttX is ported to RV32M1 RI5CY only. RI5CY is RV32IMC RISC-V CPU
with PULP extensions features:
  - Post-Incrementing load and stores,
  - Multiply-Accumulate extenstions,
  - ALU extensions,
  - Hardware Loops.

LEDs
====

The RV32M1-VEGA board has ONE user RGB LED; Only the red part led is used to 
indicate an interrupt request is being serviced.

UARTs
====

LPUART PINS
---------------

LPUART0
  RX      PC7, PB25, PA2
  TX      PC8, PB26, PA3
LPUART1
  RX      PB2, PC29, PA2, PA25
  TX      PB3, PC30, PA3, PA26
LPUART2
  RX      PB11, PB18, PB1
  TX      PB12, PB19, PB0
LPUART3
  RX      PB28, PE8, PE29
  TX      PB29, PE9, PE30

Default LPUART Configuration
--------------------------------

LPUART0 is enabled in most configurations (see */defconfig). RX and TX are
configured on pins PC7 and PC8, respectively (see include/board.h). These
two above pins are connected to onboard Debug Adpater which provides a USB-
TTL serial channel.

Buttons
====

Four tactile buttons are populated on RV32M1-VEGA Board.

Buttons PINS Assignment
---------------
NAME    PIN    EXTERNAL-PULLUP
SW2     PA0        YES
SW3     PE8        NO
SW4     PE9        NO
SW5     PE12       NO

All these buttons can be used as interrupt and wake up sources while SW2 can
be an alternative NMI Source.

ITCM
====

A 64KB ITCM is coupled with M4 Cores, RI5CY CPU or ARM Cortex-M4 CPU. If the
ITCM is selected, Critical Codes including but not limited to Exception Vectors,
Interrupt Service Routines will be placed in ITCM.

TSTMR
====

TSTMR Module is embedded in RV32M1 to provide system time stamp. It runs off 1MHz
with a 56-bit counter, and can be adopted to get more accurate delay counting. If 
the Module is selected, a hardware delay method will replace mdealy and udelay,
the built-in software delay methods.

TOOLCHAIN
========

It is preferable to use OPEN ISA gcc Toolchain to exploit RV32M1 RI5CY capabi-
lities, though the generic GNU RVG Toolchain can generate binary codes running 
on RV32M1 RI5CY without any problems. To switch generic GNU RVG Toolchain to
OPEN ISA Toolchain, the following option must be selected:

Board Selection  --->
  [*] Utilize OPEN ISA Toolchain

Make sure OPEN ISA Toolchain have been installed and be found in PATH.

ARCHCPUFLAGS
====

RI5CY Core supports hardware loop with 6 hardware loop registers assistance,
these registers could be overwritten when contexts switch. If codes are generated
by OPEN ISA Toolchain and CONFIG_ARCH_RISCV_INTXCPT_EXTREGS is not less than 6,
the RI5CY specific architecture flag will be passed to gcc compiler. In that case,
the 6 hardware loop registers must be saved and restored in interrupt routines with
the general purpose registers.

You will see the following lines in Make.defs file:

  ARCHCPURV32IM = -march=rv32imc -mabi=ilp32

  ifeq ($(CONFIG_RV32M1_OPENISA_TOOLCHAIN),y)
    ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_RISCV_INTXCPT_EXTREGS
      ifeq ($(filter 0 1 2 3 4 5 , $(CONFIG_ARCH_RISCV_INTXCPT_EXTREGS)),)
        ARCHCPURV32IM = -march=rv32imcxpulpv2
      endif
    endif
  endif

  ARCHCPUFLAGS = $(ARCHCPURV32IM)

CONFIG_ARCH_RISV_INTXCPT_EXTREGS could be configured in the following menu:

System Type  --->
  [*] RISC-V Integer Context Extensions
  (6)   Number of Extral RISC-V Integer Context Registers

Program & Debug
========

Program
====

To program RV32M1, openocd from OPEN ISA and an external jtag adapter are pre-
requisite. There are 2 tested jtag adapters: Segger Jlink EDU mini and SiPEED 
USB Jtag Adapter. The Segger Jlink EDU mini can connect J55 header on RV32M1-VEGA 
board directly while SiPEED USB Jtag Adpater has to co-operate with an Adapter 
board to setup wires connection.
Compared to Segger Jlink EDU Mini Adapter, SiPEED USB Jtag Adpater is cheaper but
not inferior.

With SiPEED USB Jtag Adapter, some patches must be applied to rv32m1_ri5cy.cfg:

------------------------------
Make sure that RV32M1 boots RI5CY, and you do this ONLY ONCE. Refer to RV32M1-VEGA
quick start guide for more details.

Note:

OPEN ISA Toolchain, rv32m1_ri5cy.cfg contained in RV32M1 SDK, and RV32M1-VEGA
quick start guide could be found in the following link:

Debug
====

riscv64-unknonw-elf-gdb can not debug RV32M1 RISC-V Cores currently. GDB from 
OPEN ISA Toolchain seems the only option and even can debug elf files generated 
by risc64-unknown-elf-* tools.

Configuration Sub-directories
========

NuttX of all configurations in rv32m1-vega/configs can be compiled by
the generic GNU RVG Toolchain and OPEN ISA Toolchain.

buttons
====
  This configuration is a variant of the NSH configuration used for
  demonstrating the four buttons on RV32M1-VEGA board.
  Example usage of buttons:

  a. Start the buttons daemon:
     nsh> buttons
 
  b. Press and release SW2, SW3, SW4, SW5 freely, the button pressed 
     and released messages will display correspondingly.

nsh
====
  This configuration is basic. getprime is included in this configuration to
  determine performance of RV32M1 RI5CY Core.

nsh-itcm
====
  This configuration is a variant of the NSH configuration used for
  demonstrating ITCM. When ITCM is selected, RI5CY Exception Vectors and
  Interrupt Service Routines are placed in ITCM. Performance can be calculated
  by getprime, and you might find it deteriorated a litte ironically. The drawback
  may be caused by long jump frequently between ITCM and flash. Besides, an instr-
  uction cache is enabled always after RI5CY resets, and amelioration could not be 
  achieved with even ITCM enabled.
  What if codes fullfill the 64KB ITCM ?
