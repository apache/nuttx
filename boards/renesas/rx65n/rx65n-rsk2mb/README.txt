Serial Console
==============
RX65N RSK2MB supports 12 serial ports (SCI0 - SCI12), however only 1 port can be tested(SCI8, which is the serial console). Only SCI8 port can be tested which is connected to USB Serial port.

Serial ports SCI1, SCI2, SCI9-SCI12, cannot be tested because they are multiplexed to other Rx65N controller interfaces.

Following SCI ports are configured w.r.t RX65N pin configuration

Serial Connection Configuration
-------------------------------
1. RSK2MB board needs to be connected to PC, using USB cable(One end of which is connected to PC, other end
connected to USB serial port on H/W board).
2. RSK USB Serial Driver needs to be downloaded on PC side.
3. Configure Teraterm to 115200 baud.

LEDs
====

  The RX65N RSK2MB board has 2 Power LED's(PowerLED5 LED_G, PowerLED3 LED_G) and 4 user LED's (LED_G, LED_O, LED_R, LED_R).

  If enabled 4 User LED's are simply turned on when the board boots
  successfully, and is blinking on panic / assertion failed.

CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE=y : Work queue support is needed
CONFIG_SCHED_HPWORK=y    :  High Priority Work queue support
CONFIG_SCHED_LPWORK=y    :  Low Priority Work queue support

Using the network with NSH
--------------------------
The IP address is configured using DHCP, using the below mentioned configurations :

CONFIG_NETUTILS_DHCPC=y
CONFIG_NETUTILS_DHCPD=y
CONFIG_NSH_DHCPC=y
CONFIG_NETINIT_DHCPC=y

nsh> ifconfig
  eth0    HWaddr 00:e0:de:ad:be:ef at UP
          IPaddr:10.75.24.53 DRaddr:10.75.24.1 Mask:255.255.254.0

You can use ping to test for connectivity to the host (Careful,
Window firewalls usually block ping-related ICMP traffic).  On the
target side, you can:

  nsh> ping 10.75.24.250
  PING 10.75.24.250 56 bytes of data
  56 bytes from 10.75.24.250: icmp_seq=1 time=0 ms
  56 bytes from 10.75.24.250: icmp_seq=2 time=0 ms
  56 bytes from 10.75.24.250: icmp_seq=3 time=0 ms
  56 bytes from 10.75.24.250: icmp_seq=4 time=0 ms
  56 bytes from 10.75.24.250: icmp_seq=5 time=0 ms
  56 bytes from 10.75.24.250: icmp_seq=6 time=0 ms
  56 bytes from 10.75.24.250: icmp_seq=7 time=0 ms
  56 bytes from 10.75.24.250: icmp_seq=8 time=0 ms
  56 bytes from 10.75.24.250: icmp_seq=9 time=0 ms
  56 bytes from 10.75.24.250: icmp_seq=10 time=0 ms
  10 packets transmitted, 10 received, 0% packet loss, time 10100 ms

On the host side, you should also be able to ping the RX65N-RSK2MB:

  $ ping 10.75.24.53

Configure UDP blaster application as mentioned below :

CONFIG_EXAMPLES_UDPBLASTER_HOSTIP=0x0a4b1801  (10.75.24.1) ------> Gateway IP
CONFIG_EXAMPLES_UDPBLASTER_NETMASK=0xfffffe00 (255.255.254.0) --------> Netmask

Debugging
==========
1. NuttX needs to be compiled in Cygwin environment on Windows.

The following Configuration needs to be set, in order to do source level debugging.

CONFIG_DEBUG_SYMBOLS = y (Set this option, using menuconfig only, DO NOT Enable this as default configuration).

2. Download & Install Renesas e2studio IDE
3. Load the project(NuttX built on Cygwin) as Makefile project with existing code
4. Right click on the project, and select Debug Configurations
5. The binary(NuttX) needs to be loaded using E1/E2 Emulator
6. Select the Device name as R5F565NE and Emulator as E1/E2(whichever is being used)
7. Select Connection type as JTAG
8. Load and run the binary

Flashing NuttX
===============
Alternatively, NuttX binary can be flashed using Renesas flash programmer tool without using e2 studio/Cygwin

Below are the steps mentioned to flash NuttX binary using Renesas flash programmer tool(RFP).

1.In order to flash using Renesas flash programmer tool, nuttx.mot file should be generated.
2. Add the following lines in tools/Makefile.unix file :
ifeq ($(CONFIG_MOTOROLA_SREC),y)
	@echo "CP: nuttx.mot"
	$(Q) $(OBJCOPY) $(OBJCOPYARGS) $(BIN) -O srec -I elf32-rx-be-ns nuttx.mot
endif
3. Add CONFIG_MOTOROLA_SREC=y in defconfig file or choose make menucofig->Build Setup-> Binary Output Format->
   Select Motorola SREC format.
4. Download Renesas flash programmer tool from https://www.renesas.com/in/en/products/software-tools/tools/programmer/renesas-flash-programmer-programming-gui.html#downloads
5. Refer to the user manual document, for steps to flash NuttX binary using RFP tool.
