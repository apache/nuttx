README
^^^^^

This is the README file for the port of NuttX to the Micropendous 3 board.
This board is develepmend by http://code.google.com/p/opendous/.  The
Micropendous 3 is based on an Atmel AT90USB646, 647, 1286 or 1287 MCU.
NuttX was ported using the AT90USB647 version.  As of this writing,
documentation for the Micropendous board is available here:

DFU Bootloader
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is also an DFU bootloader that resides in the upper 8Kb of FLASH
(unless you ERASE the flash with ICE).  You can enter this bootloader
(if it is in FLASH) by:

Holding both the SW1 (RESET) and SW2, then releasing SW1 while continuing
to hold SW2.  SW2 connects to the PE2/HWB signal and causes a reset into
the bootloader memory region.

Then you can use FLIP to load code into FLASH (available at the Atmel Web
Site).  The DFU USB driver for the DFU bootload is available in the usb
subdirectory in the FLIP installation location.

Serial Console
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  A serial console is supported on an external MAX232/MAX3232 Connected
  on PD2 and PD3:

  Port D, Bit 2: RXD1, Receive Data (Data input pin for the USART1). When
    the USART1 receiver is enabled this pin is configured as an input
    regardless of the value of DDD2. When the USART forces this pin to
    be an input, the pull-up can still be controlled by the PORTD2 bit.
  Port D, Bit 3: TXD1, Transmit Data (Data output pin for the USART1).
    When the USART1 Transmitter is enabled, this pin is configured as
    an output regardless of the value of DDD3.

Toolchains
^^^^^^^^^^

There are several toolchain options.  However, testing has been performed
using *only* the NuttX buildroot toolchain described below.  Therefore,
the NuttX buildroot toolchain is the recommended choice.

The toolchain may be selected using the kconfig-mconf tool (via 'make menuconfig'),
by editing the existing configuration file (defconfig), or by overriding
the toolchain on the make commandline with CONFIG_AVR_TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>.

The valid values for <toolchain> are BUILDROOT, CROSSPACK, LINUXGCC and WINAVR.

Buildroot:

  There is a DIY buildroot version for the AVR boards here:
  http://bitbucket.org/nuttx/buildroot/downloads/.  See the
  following section for details on building this toolchain.

  Before building, make sure that the path to the new toolchain is included
  in your PATH environment variable.

  After configuring NuttX, make sure that CONFIG_AVR_BUILDROOT_TOOLCHAIN=y is set in your
  .config file.

WinAVR:

  For Cygwin development environment on Windows machines, you can use
  WinAVR: http://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr/files/

  Before building, make sure that the path to the new toolchain is included
  in your PATH environment variable.

  After configuring NuttX, make sure that CONFIG_AVR_WINAVR_TOOLCHAIN=y is set in your
  .config file.

  WARNING:  There is an incompatible version of cygwin.dll in the WinAVR/bin
  directory!  Make sure that the path to the correct cygwin.dll file precedes
  the path to the WinAVR binaries!

Linux:

  For Linux, there are widely available avr-gcc packages.  On Ubuntu, use:
  sudo apt-get install gcc-avr gdb-avr avr-libc

  After configuring NuttX, make sure that CONFIG_AVR_LINUXGCC_TOOLCHAIN=y is set in your
  .config file.

macOS:

  For macOS, the CrossPack for AVR toolchain is available from:

    http://www.obdev.at/products/crosspack/index.html

  This toolchain is functionally equivalent to the Linux GCC toolchain.

Windows Native Toolchains
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The WinAVR toolchain is a Windows native toolchain. There are several
  limitations to using a Windows native toolchain in a Cygwin environment.
  The three biggest are:

  1. The Windows toolchain cannot follow Cygwin paths.  Path conversions are
     performed automatically in the Cygwin makefiles using the 'cygpath'
     utility but you might easily find some new path problems.  If so, check
     out 'cygpath -w'

  2. Windows toolchains cannot follow Cygwin symbolic links.  Many symbolic
     links are used in NuttX (e.g., include/arch).  The make system works
     around these  problems for the Windows tools by copying directories
     instead of linking them.  But this can also cause some confusion for
     you:  For example, you may edit a file in a "linked" directory and find
     that your changes had no effect. That is because you are building the
     copy of the file in the "fake" symbolic directory.  If you use a
     Windows toolchain, you should get in the habit of making like this:

       make clean_context all

     An alias in your .bashrc file might make that less painful.

  An additional issue with the WinAVR toolchain, in particular, is that it
  contains an incompatible version of the Cygwin DLL in its bin/ directory.
  You must take care that the correct Cygwin DLL is used.

NuttX buildroot Toolchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  If NuttX buildroot toolchain source tarball cne can be downloaded from the
  NuttX Bitbucket download site (https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx/downloads/).
  This GNU toolchain builds and executes in the Linux or Cygwin environment.

  1. You must have already configured NuttX in <some-dir>/nuttx.

     tools/configure.sh micropendous3:<sub-dir>

     NOTE: you also must copy avr-libc header files into the NuttX include
     directory with command perhaps like:

     cp -a /cygdrive/c/WinAVR/include/avr include/.

  2. Download the latest buildroot package into <some-dir>

  3. unpack the buildroot tarball.  The resulting directory may
     have versioning information on it like buildroot-x.y.z.  If so,
     rename <some-dir>/buildroot-x.y.z to <some-dir>/buildroot.

  4. cd <some-dir>/buildroot

  5. cp boards/avr-defconfig-4.5.2 .config

  6. make oldconfig

  7. make

  8. Make sure that the PATH variable includes the path to the newly built
     binaries.

  See the file boards/README.txt in the buildroot source tree.  That has more
  detailed PLUS some special instructions that you will need to follow if you
  are building a toolchain for Cygwin under Windows.

avr-libc
^^^^^^^^

Header Files

  In any case, header files from avr-libc are required:  http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/.
  A snapshot of avr-lib is included in the WinAVR installation. For Linux
  development platforms, avr-libc package is readily available (and would
  be installed in the apt-get command shown above).  But if you are using
  the NuttX buildroot configuration on Cygwin, then you will have to build
  get avr-libc from binaries.

Header File Installation

  The NuttX build will required that the AVR header files be available via
  the NuttX include directory.  This can be accomplished by either copying
  the avr-libc header files into the NuttX include directory:

  cp -a <avr-libc-path>/include/avr <nuttx-path>/include/.

  Or simply using a symbolic link:

  ln -s <avr-libc-path>/include/avr <nuttx-path>/include/.

Build Notes:

  It may not necessary to have a built version of avr-lib; only header files
  are required.  Bu if you choose to use the optimized libraru functions of
  the flowing point library, then you may have to build avr-lib from sources.
  Below are instructions for building avr-lib from fresh sources:

  1. Download the avr-libc package from:

     http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/avr-libc/

     I am using avr-lib-1.7.1.tar.bz2

  2. Upack the tarball and cd into the

     tar jxf avr-lib-1.7.1.tar.bz2
     cd avr-lib-1.7.1

  3. Configure avr-lib.  Assuming that WinAVR is installed at the following
     location:

     export PATH=/cygdrive/c/WinAVR/bin:$PATH
     ./configure --build=`./config.guess` --host=avr

     This takes a *long* time.

  4. Make avr-lib.

     make

     This also takes a long time because it generates variants for nearly
     all AVR chips.

  5. Install avr-lib.

     make install

Configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Common Configuration Notes
--------------------------

  1. Each Micropendous3 configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
     can be selected as follow:

       tools/configure.sh micropendous3:<subdir>

     Where <subdir> is one of the configuration sub-directories described in
     the following paragraph.

     NOTE: You must also copy avr-libc header files, perhaps like:

       cp -a /cygdrive/c/WinAVR/include/avr include/.

  2. These configurations use the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
     change a configurations using that tool, you should:

     a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
        see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.

     b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
        reconfiguration process.

  3. By default, all configurations assume the NuttX Buildroot toolchain
     under Cygwin with Windows.  This is easily reconfigured:

        CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y
        CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y
        CONFIG_AVR_BUILDROOT_TOOLCHAIN=y

Configuration Sub-Directories
