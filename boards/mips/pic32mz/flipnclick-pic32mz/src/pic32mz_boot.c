 *  This entry point is called early in the initialization -- after all memory
 *  has been configured and mapped but before any devices have been
 * initialized.

 *   called immediately after up_initialize() is called and just before the
 *   initial application is started.  This additional initialization phase
 *   may be used, for example, to initialize board-specific device drivers.
