/* There are four LEDs on the top, red side of the board.  Only one can be
 * controlled by software:
 *
 *   LED L      - RB14 (SPI3_SCK)
 *
 * There are also four LEDs on the back, white side of the board:
 *
 *   LED A      - RA6
 *   LED B      - RA7
 *   LED C      - RE0
 *   LED D      - RE1
 *
 * A high output value illuminates the LEDs.
 *
 * These LEDs are available to the application and are all available to the
 * application unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is defined.  In that case, the usage
 * by the board port is defined in include/board.h and src/sam_autoleds.c.
 * The LEDs are used to encode OS-related events as follows:
 *
 *   SYMBOL           MEANING                        LED STATE
 *                                             L   A   B   C   D
 *   ---------------- ----------------------- --- --- --- --- ---
 *   LED_STARTED      NuttX has been started  OFF ON  OFF OFF OFF
 *   LED_HEAPALLOCATE Heap has been allocated OFF OFF ON  OFF OFF
 *   LED_IRQSENABLED  Interrupts enabled      OFF OFF OFF ON  OFF
 *   LED_STACKCREATED Idle stack created      OFF OFF OFF OFF ON
 *   LED_INIRQ        In an interrupt         GLO N/C N/C N/C N/C
 *   LED_SIGNAL       In a signal handler     GLO N/C N/C N/C N/C
 *   LED_ASSERTION    An assertion failed     GLO N/C N/C N/C N/C
 *   LED_PANIC        The system has crashed  2Hz N/C N/C N/C N/C
 *   LED_IDLE         MCU is is sleep mode    ---- Not used -----
 *
 * Thus if LED L is faintly glowing and all other LEDs are off (except LED
 * D which was left on but is no longer controlled by NuttX and so may be in
 * any state), NuttX has successfully booted and is, apparently, running
 * normally and taking interrupts.  If any of LEDs A-D are statically set,
 * then NuttX failed to boot and the LED indicates the initialization phase
 * where the failure occurred.  If LED L is flashing at approximately 2Hz,
 * then a fatal error has been detected and the system has halted.
 *
 * NOTE: After booting, LEDs A-D are no longer used by the system and may
 * be controlled the application.
