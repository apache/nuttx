config ESP32_MERGE_BINS
	bool "Merge raw binary files into a single file"
	default n
	---help---
		Merge the raw binary files into a single file for flashing to the
		device.
		This is only useful when the path to binary files (e.g. bootloader)
		is provided via the ESPTOOL_BINDIR variable.

config ESP32_QEMU_IMAGE
	bool "ESP32 binary image for QEMU"
	default n
	---help---
		Create a binary flash image used for QEMU.

	depends on ESP32_SPIFLASH

	config ESP32_SPIFLASH_SMARTFS
		bool "SmartFS"
		depends on FS_SMARTFS

	config ESP32_SPIFLASH_NXFFS
		bool "NXFFS"
		depends on FS_NXFFS

	config ESP32_SPIFLASH_SPIFFS
		bool "SPIFFS"

config ESP32_LCD_OVERCLOCK
	bool "Run LCD at higher clock speed than allowed"
	default n
	depends on LCD_ILI9341
	---help---
		The ILI9341 and ST7789 specify that the maximum clock speed for the
		SPI interface is 10MHz. However, in practice the driver chips work
		fine with a higher clock rate, and using that gives a better
		framerate. Select this to try using the out-of-spec clock rate.
