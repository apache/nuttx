config ESP32_MERGE_BINS
	bool "Merge raw binary files into a single file"
	default n
	---help---
		Merge the raw binary files into a single file for flashing to the
		device.
		This is only useful when the path to binary files (e.g. bootloader)
		is provided via the ESPTOOL_BINDIR variable.

config ESP32_QEMU_IMAGE
	bool "ESP32 binary image for QEMU"
	default n
	select ESP32_MERGE_BINS
	---help---
		Create a binary flash image used for QEMU.

choice ESP32_SPIFLASH_FS
	prompt "Mount SPI Flash MTD on bring-up"
	default ESP32_SPIFLASH_SMARTFS
	depends on ESP32_SPIFLASH
	optional
	---help---
		Mount the SPI Flash MTD with the selected File System format on board
		bring-up.
		If not selected, the MTD will be registered as a device node on /dev.

	config ESP32_SPIFLASH_SMARTFS
		bool "SmartFS"

		select MTD_SMART
		depends on !ESP32_SECURE_FLASH_ENC_ENABLED

	config ESP32_SPIFLASH_NXFFS
		bool "NXFFS"
		select FS_NXFFS
		depends on !ESP32_SECURE_FLASH_ENC_ENABLED

	comment "NXFFS not supported with Flash Encryption"

	config ESP32_SPIFLASH_SPIFFS
		bool "SPIFFS"
		select FS_SPIFFS
		depends on !ESP32_SECURE_FLASH_ENC_ENABLED

	comment "SPIFFS not supported with Flash Encryption"
		depends on ESP32_SECURE_FLASH_ENC_ENABLED

	config ESP32_SPIFLASH_LITTLEFS

config ESP32_LCD_OVERCLOCK
	bool "Run LCD at higher clock speed than allowed"
	default n
	depends on LCD_ILI9341
	---help---
		The ILI9341 and ST7789 specify that the maximum clock speed for the
		SPI interface is 10MHz. However, in practice the driver chips work
		fine with a higher clock rate, and using that gives a better
		framerate. Select this to try using the out-of-spec clock rate.
