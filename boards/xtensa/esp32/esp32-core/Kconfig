		The default configuration is set up run from IRAM.  However, the
		current (2016-11-14) OpenOCD for ESP32 does not support writing to
		FLASH.  This option sets up the linker scripts to support execution
		from IRAM.  In this case, OpenOCD can be used to load directly into
		IRAM.

		At this stage the nuttx image is small enough to be entirely memory-
		resident.  Once board support is more mature you can add flash cache
		mapping code to run from SPI flash after initial boot. There are at
		least two possible approaches you could take: You can add the flash
		cache mapping code into nuttx directly, so it is self-contained -
		early nuttx initialization runs from IRAM and enables flash cache,
		and then off you go. Or you can use the esp-idf software bootloader
		and partition table scheme and have nuttx be an esp-idf "app" which
		allows interoperability with the esp-idf system but makes you
		reliant on the esp-idf design for these parts. Both are possible.
