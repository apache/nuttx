config ESP32S2_MERGE_BINS
	bool "Merge raw binary files into a single file"
	default n
	---help---
		Merge the raw binary files into a single file for flashing to the
		device.
		This is only useful when the path to binary files (e.g. bootloader)
		is provided via the ESPTOOL_BINDIR variable.

choice ESP32S2_SPIFLASH_FS
	prompt "Mount SPI Flash MTD on bring-up"
	default ESP32S2_SPIFLASH_SMARTFS
	depends on ESPRESSIF_SPIFLASH
	optional
	---help---
		Mount the SPI Flash MTD with the selected File System format on board
		bring-up.
		If not selected, the MTD will be registered as a device node on /dev.

config ESP32S2_LCD_OVERCLOCK
	bool "Run LCD at higher clock speed than allowed"
	default n
	depends on LCD_ILI9341
	---help---
		The ILI9341 and ST7789 specify that the maximum clock speed for the
		SPI interface is 10MHz. However, in practice the driver chips work
		fine with a higher clock rate, and using that gives a better
		framerate. Select this to try using the out-of-spec clock rate.
