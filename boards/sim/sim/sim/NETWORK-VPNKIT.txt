Network support with VPNKit
===========================

The simulation can be configured to use VPNKit to provide network support.
While this was developed for macOS, it should work on other platforms
as well.

Configuration
-------------

    CONFIG_SIM_NETDEV=y
    CONFIG_SIM_NETDEV_TAP is not set
    CONFIG_SIM_NETDEV_VPNKIT=y

You can use the sim:vpnkit configuration, which includes the above
settings.

    ./tools/configure.sh sim:vpnkit

VPNKit setup
------------

See https://github.com/moby/vpnkit for build instructions.

If you have Docker Desktop for Mac installed on your machine,
you can find a vpnkit binary at:

    /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/com.docker.vpnkit

How to run
----------

You can use it as the following:

    % vpnkit --ethernet /tmp/vpnkit-nuttx &
    % ./nuttx

NOTE: The unix domain socket path (/tmp/vpnkit-nuttx) is
currently hardcoded in the code.
