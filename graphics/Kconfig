config NX
	bool "NX Graphics"
	default n
	select NXGLIB
	select NXFONTS
	---help---
		Enables overall support for graphics library and NX

if NX

config NX_LCDDRIVER
	bool "LCD driver"
	default y
	depends on LCD
	---help---
		By default, the NX graphics system uses the frame buffer driver interface
		defined in include/nuttx/video/fb.h.  However, if LCD is support is enabled,
		this option is provided to select, instead, the LCD driver interface
		defined in include/nuttx/lcd/lcd.h.

config NX_NDISPLAYS
	int "Maximum number of displays supported"
	default 1
	range 1 9
	---help---
		The maximum number of displays that can be supported by the NX server.
		Normally this takes the value one but may be increased to support systems
		with multiple displays.

config NX_NPLANES
	int "Number of Color Planes"
	default 1
	range 1 8
	---help---
		Some YUV color formats requires support for multiple planes, one for
		each color component.  Unless you have such special hardware (and
		are willing to debug a lot of untested logic), this value should be
		set to 1.

config NX_RAMBACKED
	bool "RAM backed windows"
	default n
	---help---
		If this option is selected, then windows may be optionally created
		with a RAM framebuffer backing up the window content.  Rending into
		the window will result in rending into the backup framebuffer, then
		updating the physical display from the framebuffer.

		The advantage of this option is that the application that manages
		window will no longer receive redraw() callbacks.  Those calls
		normally occur when a window "above" moves exposing a portion of the
		window below.  If this option is selected, then the system will
		redraw the exposed portion of the window from the backup framebuffer
		without intervention of the window applications.  This greatly
		reduces the complexity of the application and performance of the
		window at the expense of increased memory usage.

		Redraw requests in other cases are also suppressed:  Changes to window
		position, size, etc.  As a consequence, some manual updates will be
		required when certain events occur (like removing a toolbar from a
		window).

		An exception is the case when the window is resized to a wider and/or
		taller size.  In that case, the redraw callback will till occur.
		It is necessary in that case to provide new graphic content for the
		extended window area.

		NOTE:  A significant amount of RAM, usually external SDRAM, may be
		required to use per-window framebuffers.

choice
	prompt "Cursor support"
	default NX_NOCURSOR

config NX_NOCURSOR
	bool "No cursor support"

config NX_SWCURSOR
	bool "Software cursor support"
	depends on !NX_LCDDRIVER && NX_DISABLE_1BPP && NX_DISABLE_2BPP && NX_DISABLE_4BPP && !BUILD_KERNEL
	---help---
		Software cursor support has several dependencies are due to un-
		implemented cursor capabilities.  This assumes the following:

		  1. You are using a framebuffer hardware interface.  This is
		     because the logic to implement this feature on top of the LCD
		     interface has not been implemented.
		  2. The pixel depth is greater then or equal to 8-bits (8-bpp,
		     16-bpp, 24/32/-bpp).  This is because the logic to handle
		     pixels smaller than 1-byte has not been implemented,
		  3. For FLAT and PROTECTED builds only.  In those builds, the
		     cursor image resides in the common application space and is
		     assumed to pesist as long as needed.  But with the KERNEL
		     build, the image will lie in a process space and will not be
		     generally available.  In that case, we could keep the image in
		     a shared memory region or perhaps copy the image into a kernel
		     internal buffer.  Neither of  those are implemented.

config NX_HWCURSOR
	bool "Hardware cursor support"
	depends on FB_HWCURSOR && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
		Hardware cursor support has not been implemented, hence the
		EXPERIMENTAL dependency.

endchoice # Cursor support

config NX_HWCURSORIMAGE
	bool "Support hardware cursor images"
	default n
	depends on NX_HWCURSOR

config NX_BGCOLOR
	hex "Initial background color"
	default 0x0
	---help---
		NX will clear the background plane initially.  This is the default
		color that will be used when the background is cleared.  Note: This
		logic would have to be extended if you want to support multiple
		color planes.

config NX_ANTIALIASING
	bool "Anti-aliasing support"
	default n
	depends on (!NX_DISABLE_16BPP || !NX_DISABLE_24BPP || !NX_DISABLE_32BPP) && !NX_LCDDRIVER
	---help---
		Enable support for anti-aliasing when rendering lines as various
		orientations.

config NX_WRITEONLY
	bool "Write-only Graphics Device"
	default y if NX_LCDDRIVER && LCD_NOGETRUN
	default n if !NX_LCDDRIVER || !LCD_NOGETRUN
	---help---
		Define if the underlying graphics device does not support read operations.
		Automatically defined if NX_LCDDRIVER and LCD_NOGETRUN are
		defined.

config NX_UPDATE
	bool "Display update hooks"
	default FB_UPDATE && !NX_LCDDRIVER
	---help---
		Enable a callout to inform some external module that the display has
		been updated.  This would be useful in a couple for cases.

		- When a serial LCD is used, but a framebuffer is used to access the
		  LCD.  In this case, the update callout can be used to refresh the
		  affected region of the display.

		- When VNC is enabled.  This is case, this callout is necessary to
		  update the remote frame buffer to match the local framebuffer.

		When this feature is enabled, some external logic must provide this
		interface:

		  fb_vtable_s
		  {
		    int (*updatearea)(FAR struct fb_vtable_s *vtable,
		                      FAR const struct fb_area_s *area);
		  };

		That is the function that will handle the notification.  It
		receives the rectangular region that was updated in the provided
		plane.

	---help---
		Currently, NxTerm supports only a single pixel depth. This
		configuration setting must be provided to support that single pixel depth.
		Default: The smallest enabled pixel depth. (see NX_DISABLE_*BPP)

config NXTERM_CURSORCHAR
	int "Character code to use as the cursor"
	default 137
	---help---
		The bitmap code to use as the cursor.  Default '_' (137)

config NXTERM_MXCHARS
	int "Max Characters on Display"
	default 128
	---help---
		NxTerm needs to remember every character written to the console so
		that it can redraw the window. This setting determines the size of some
		internal memory allocations used to hold the character data. Default: 128.

config NXTERM_CACHESIZE
	int "Font Cache Size"
	default 16
	---help---
		NxTerm supports caching of rendered fonts. This font caching is required
		for two reasons: (1) First, it improves text performance, but more
		importantly (2) it preserves the font memory. Since the NX server runs on
		a separate server thread, it requires that the rendered font memory persist
		until the server has a chance to render the font. Unfortunately, the font
		cache would be quite large if all fonts were saved. The NXTERM_CACHESIZE
		setting will control the size of the font cache (in number of glyphs). Only that
		number of the most recently used glyphs will be retained. Default: 16.
		NOTE: There can still be a race condition between the NxTerm driver and the
		NX task.  If you every see character corruption (especially when printing
		a lot of data or scrolling), then increasing the value of NXTERM_CACHESIZE
		is something that you should try.  Alternatively, you can reduce the size of
		MQ_MAXMSGSIZE which will force NxTerm task to pace the server task.
		NXTERM_CACHESIZE should be larger than MQ_MAXMSGSIZE in any event.

config NXTERM_LINESEPARATION
	int "Line Separation"
	default 0
	---help---
		This the space (in rows) between each row of test.  Default: 0

config NXTERM_NOWRAP
	bool "No wrap"
	default n
	---help---
		By default, lines will wrap when the test reaches the right hand side
		of the window. This setting can be defining to change this behavior so
		that the text is simply truncated until a new line is  encountered.

comment "NxTerm Input options"

config NXTERM_NXKBDIN
	bool "NX KBD input"
	default n
	---help---
		Take input from the NX keyboard input callback.  By default, keyboard
		input is taken from stdin (/dev/console).  If this option is set, then
		the interface nxterm_kdbin() is enabled.  That interface may be driven
		by window callback functions so that keyboard input *only* goes to the
		top window.

		NOTE: nxterm_kdbin() is an internal OS API.  It can be accessed by
		applications via the boardctl(BOARDIOC_NXTERM) interface.

		The logic path is complex in this case:  (1) The keyboard input is
		received by an application listener thread and injected into NX via
		nx_kbdin().  NX sends (2) the keyboard input to single the NX window
		that has focus.  That window then (3) gives the keyboard input to the
		single NxTerm associated with the window via boardctl(BOARDIOC_NXTERM).

		NOTE:  If CONFIG_NXTERM_NXKBDIN not defined, then NxTerm input coming
		directly from /dev/console.  That works well if there is only a single
		NxTerm window.  But if there are multiple NxTerm windows, then it is
		anyone's guess which will receive the keyboard input.  That does not
		work well in such cases.

config NXTERM_KBDBUFSIZE
	int "Keyboard Input Buffer Size"
	default 16
	---help---
		If NXTERM_NXKBDIN is enabled, then this value may be used to
		define the size of the per-window keyboard input buffer.  Default: 16

config NXTERM_NPOLLWAITERS
	int "Number of Poll Waiters"
	default 4
	---help---
		The number of threads that can be waiting for read data available.
		Default: 4

config NX_MXSERVERMSGS
	int "Max Server Messages"
	default 32
	---help---
		Specifies the maximum number of messages that can fit in the message queues.
		No additional resources are allocated, but this can be set to prevent
		flooding of the client or server with too many messages (PREALLOC_MQ_MSGS
		controls how many messages are pre-allocated).

	bool "External Display Initialization"
	default n
	select LCD_EXTERNINIT if LCD && LCD_FRAMEBUFFER && NX_LCDDRIVER
	---help---
		Define to support external display initialization by platform-
		specific code.  If this option is defined, then nxmu_start()
		will call board_graphics_setup(CONFIG_NXSTART_DEVNO) to
		initialize the graphics device.  This option is necessary if
		display is used that cannot be initialized using the standard
		LCD or framebuffer interfaces.

config NXSTART_SERVERPRIO
	int "NX Server priority"
