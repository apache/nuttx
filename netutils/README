include:

  resolv    - uIP DNS resolver
  smtp      - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) client
  telnetd   - TELNET server
  webclient - HTTP web client
  webserver - HTTP web server

Additional applications that were not part of uIP (but which are
highly influenced by uIP) include:

  dhcpd     - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server
  tftpc     - TFTP client
  thttpd    - This is a port of Jef Poskanzer's THTTPD HTPPD server.
