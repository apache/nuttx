 * The XFLAT program image is divided into two segments:
 *
 * (1) ISpace (Instruction Space).  This is the segment that contains
 *     code (.text) as well as read-only data (.rodata).  Everything in the
 *     segment should be fetch-able  machine PC instructions (jump, branch,
 *     call, etc.) or PC-relative loads.
 * (2) DSpace (Data Space).  This is the segment that contains read-write
 *     data (.data, .bss). Everything in this segment should be access-able
 *     with machine PIC load and store instructions.
 *
 * Older versions of GCC (at least up to GCC 4.3.3), use GOT-relative
 * addressing to access RO data. In that case, read-only data (.rodata) must
 * reside in D-Space and this linker script should NOT be used with those
 * older tools.
 *
 * Newer versions of GCC (at least as of GCC 4.6.3), use PC-relative
 * addressing to access RO data. In that case, read-only data (.rodata) must
 * reside in I-Space and this linker script should be used.
