nuttx-0.3.0
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 12th release of NuttX.  This release includes the initial
integration of a network subsystem and the uIP TCP/IP stack into NuttX
(see http://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/index.php/Main_Page).  Also included
is a device driver for the Davicom DM90x0 ethernet controller.

This integration is very preliminary.  Only a small portion of the
network functionality has been integrated and there are a number of
open issues (see the TODO file).  The network subsystem is pre-alpha
at this point in time.  I expect that it will stabilize and mature
over the next few releases.

The baseline functionality of NuttX continues to mature and remains at
post-beta (as long as the network is not used).

See the ChangeLog for a complete list of changes.

This release has been verified only on the Neuros OSD (DM320 ARM9)
platform using the DM90x0 driver.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from November 6, 2007.

nuttx-0.3.1
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 13th release of NuttX and the second release containing
the integration of a network subsystem and the uIP TCP/IP, UDP, and
ICMP stacks into NuttX (see http://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/index.php/Main_Page).

Many network-related problems have been fixed and the implementation
has matured significantly.  However, the level of network reliability
is probably still at the pre-alpha or early level.  It is sufficiently
complete that you may begin to perform some network integration and
is exepcted to achieve beta level of reliability over the next few
releases.

The baseline functionality of NuttX continues to mature and remains at
post-beta (as long as the network is not used).

See the ChangeLog for a complete list of changes.

This release has been verified only on the Neuros OSD (DM320 ARM9)
platform using the DM90x0 driver.

has matured significantly.  This release consists of:

o TCP-related bug-fixes for disconnecting sockets
o Correction of some TCP read-ahead logic
o TCP performance improvements
o Misc. additions and cleanup (See the ChangeLog for a complete list of
  changes).

The level of network reliability is at an early beta release level.  The
baseline functionality of NuttX continues to mature and remains at
post-beta. Open network-related issues include only:

o Some minor unimplemented BSD socket functionality,
o Thread safety issues: the same socket cannot be used concurrently on
  different threads.
o Pending design changes necessary to support multiple network interfaces.
o IPv6 support is incomplete.

This release has been verified only on the Neuros OSD (DM320 ARM9)
platform using the DM90x0 driver. Any feedback for improving the network
reliability/performance would be greatly appreciated.

release and intended to synchronize with the current CVS contents.  See
the ChangeLog for a detailed list of changes and fixes.

This release were verified only on the Spectrum Digital C5471 EVM using
the C5471 Ethernet driver. Any feedback about bugs or suggestions for
improvement would be greatly appreciated.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from December 18, 2007.

nuttx-0.3.6
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 18th release of NuttX.  This release contains on a few
changes.  The primary purpose of this release is to synchronize with
the release of the pascal-0.1.0 add-on package.

This release of NuttX includes the following changes:

* Fixes for use with SDCC compiler
* Added a simulated z80 target (arch/z80)
* Fix deadlock errors when using stdio but with no buffering
* Add support for the add-on Pascal P-Code interpreter (pcode/)
  (see the pascal-0.1.0 package)

This release were verified only on the simulated Z80 and and host
simulation targets.  As usual, any feedback about bugs or suggestions
for improvement would be greatly appreciated.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from January 6, 2007.

====

There was an error in the initial 0.3.6 release that prevented
a successful build unless the Pascal add-on was present.  The
tarball was patched to include the fix.  Make sure that you download
the nuttx-0.3.6.1.tar.gz version to avoid this problem.

nuttx-0.3.7
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 19th release of NuttX.  This release includes the
preliminary port of NuttX to the ZiLOG z16f 16-bit microcontroller.
This port was verified using the ZiLOG z16f2800100zcog Development
and the ZiLOG ZDS-II toolchain. See http://www.zilog.com for
further information.

I emphasize that this is a preliminary release of the z16f port and
is only alpha or, perhaps, pre-alpha quality as of this writing.
There are a list of known issues in the TODO file in the root of
the NuttX directory.  The overall quality of NuttX (excluding the
z16f port) continues to improve beyond the late beta level.

The z16f port required numerous changes to NuttX to handle:

* NEAR and FAR addressing, and
* Use of a Windows native toolchain in a Cygwin build environment.

In addition to the z16f port, at least one very critical bug was
found and corrected in NuttX:  The thread-specific errno value of one
task was being randomly trashed when a different thread exitted.

This release were verified on the ZiLOG z16f2800100zcog, Neuros OSD
(ARM9), and the simulation platforms.  As usual, any feedback about bugs
or suggestions for improvement would be greatly appreciated.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from January 31, 2008.

nuttx-0.3.8

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from September 1, 2008.

nutt-0.3.14
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 26th release of NuttX.  This release includes some important bugfixes as well
as a few new features.  Critical bugs fixed include:

  FAT FS:
  * Fixed several critical bugs with regard to fat reading and writing and FAT12
    accesses.  Basically the FAT FS only worked with my tiny test files and test
    cases.  A lot of stronger FAT tested is still needed!!
  * Fixed another FAT bug in implementation of FAT lseek; this prohibit correct
    random access to large files.

  Network:
  * Corrected a critical bug that may prevent recvfrom from receiving packets from
    most remote UDP port numbers.
  * Corrected an error in multi-threaded socket handling in send() and sendto().
    Outgoing data could overwrite incoming data.
  * Corrected IP checksum calculation in ICMP and UDP message send logic.
  * Corrected an error in send() timeout logic.

New features were also added:

  Network:
  * Added support for application access to ICMP protocol stacks; Added
    ping request logic (net/uip).
  * Added basic TFTP client logic (netutils/tftpc).

  NuttShell (NSH):
  * New commands: 'test', '[', 'ping', 'mkrd', 'xd', andTFTP 'get' and 'put'
    commands (See the new NuttShell User Guide for additional information).

Other less critical bugs were also fixed and other less important features were
were added (See the ChangeLog for details).

These changes were verified only on the Neuros OSD (ARM9).  Please report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from September 8, 2008.

nutt-0.3.15
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 27th release of NuttX.  This release includes some new features:

  * Adds support for the ROMFS filesystem
  * ROMFS supports mmap() to provide eXecute In Place (XIP) capability
  * NuttShell (NSH) can be configured to use ROMFS to provide a tiny read-only
    filesystem with a startup script in /etc.
  * Completed the basic port of the NXP LPC2148 on the mcu123.com board.
    The basic port includes successful booting, timer interrupts, serial console,
    succesfully passing the examples/ostest, and a NuttShell (NSH) configuration.

These changes were verified only on the mcu123.com NXP LPC2148 board.  Please report
any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from September 20, 2008.

nutt-0.3.16
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 28th release of NuttX.  This release includes the first support for
USB in NuttX.  A set of USB APIs were added to support USB device controller
drivers and bindings to USB device class drivers.  The form of the interface
was inspired by the Linux Gadget APIs.

At present USB device controller drivers are included for:

  * The NXP LPC214x.  This driver has been verified and is an early alpha
    stage in quality.
  * TI DM320.  Coding for this driver is complete but it is completely untested
    as of this release.

A controller-independent class driver is also included for:

  * USB serial class device driver (emulates the Prolific PL2303 serial-to-USB
    adaptor).  This drver has only been verified with the Linux host PL2303
    driver.

Other new features include:

  * Add an option to set aside a separate stack for interrupt handling (ARM only).
    This is useful when memory is constrained, there are multiple tasks, and
    the interrupt stack requirement is high (as when USB is enabled).

A few bugs were also fixed:

  * Fixed the frequency of system timer interrupts in the NXP LPC214x port
    (off by 20x in nuttx-0.3.15)
  * Fixed serial driver bugs related to (1) open counts and (2) recognizing
    O_NONBLOCK on read.
  * Fixed an error in read(); it was not setting the errno on errors returned
    from the driver.

These changes were verified only on the mcu123.com NXP LPC2148 board using with
a Linux host.  Please report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from Octobor 10, 2008.

UPDATE
^^^^^^
This release does not build for the ARM target when USB is disabled.  Here is the fix:

nuttx-0.3.17
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 29th release of NuttX.  This release includes the additional support for
USB in NuttX.  The following new features were added:

  * Added support for SPI-based MMC/SD cards (with an SPI driver for the NXP LPC214x).
  * Added USB storage class device side driver (BBB)
  * Added an example that demonstrates the USB storage class by exporting the SPI
    based MMC/SD card on the NXP LPC214x.

This is an early alpha release of these drivers.  At present they only work with
debug features enabled so there are probably some race conditions that occur only
with debug features disabled (anyone out there with a USB analyzer?  I would love
to know what is happening).

Several important bugs were also fixed in the FAT file system, USB serial driver and
NXP LPC214x USB controller driver (see the ChangeLog for details).

These changes were verified only on the mcu123.com NXP LPC2148 board using a Linux
development environment.  USB testing was performed using both a Linux host and a WinXP
host.  Please report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from Octobor 28, 2008.

nuttx-0.3.18
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 30th release of NuttX.  This release includes two partially completed
ports, several new features, and a couple of important bug fixes.  The two partially
completed ports are:

	* The STMicro STR71x processor and configuration for the Olimex STR-P711
	  board.
	* The Hitachi SH-1 using the SH1_LCEVB1 (SH-1/US7032EVB1) board

Progress on these ports is stalled (as detailed in the ChangeLog).

The new features focus primarily on management of block devices and extensions of
the NuttShell (NSH).  These include:

	* A loop device that converts a file into a block device.
	* A block to character (BCH) driver that  allow access a block device as
	  if it were character device.
	* Added strcasecmp() and strncasecmp() libc functions.
	* Added the 'dd' and 'losetup' commands to NSH. These commands (along
	  with mkfatfs and mount), give good managment of filesystems on the target.

Several bugs were fixed, the most important of which are:

	* Fixed a race condition workaround delay in LPC214X SPI logic.  This was also
	  the cause of some bad MMC/SD performance on that platform.
	* Fixed a recently introduced FAT file system problem: It would mount a (invalid)
	  FAT file system even if the medium is not formatted!
	* Corrected two iother important errors in the FAT lseek implementation:
	  (1) the sectors-per-cluster value was being reset to "1" and (2) important
	  lseek logic was omitted when the seek position was zero.

The FAT filesystem has had many bugs fixed in it and, I think, is now maturing
and becoming stable.

These changes were verified only on the mcu123.com NXP LPC2148 board, the Hitachi
SH1_LCEVB1 board, and the Linux simulator, all using a Linux development environment.
Please report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from November 16, 2008.

nuttx-0.3.19
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 31st release of NuttX.  This release includes the following new feature:

	* Add poll() and select() APIs that may be used to monitor for data
	  availability on character devices or TCP/IP sockets.
	* Implemented support TCP/IP connection backlog.  This allows select to wake-up
	  on new connections to a listener socket.
	* Added definition of a framebuffer driver and implement framebuffer drivers
	  for the simulated platform and the TI DM320 (untested as of the inital check-in).
	* Partially developed a graphics framework based on the framebuffer drivers,
	  however, this will not be ready for use for a few more release.  Currently
	  this includes only a few color conversion routines and some rasteizing functions.
	  A tiny windowing system is under development but not ready for check-in yet.
	* Added support for fixed precision math.
	* Added support for outgoing multicast packets.

Several bugs were fixed, the most important of which are:

	* Fixed an important bug in the TCP/IP buffering logic.  When TCP/IP read-ahead is enabled
	  and not recv() is in-place when a TCP/IP packet is received, the packet is placed into
	  a read-ahead buffer.  However, the old contents of the read-ahead buffer were not being
	  cleared and old data would contaminate the newly received buffer.
	* Changed the behavior of the serial driver read.  It now returns data as it
	  is available rather than waiting for the full requested read size.  This
	  makes functions like fgetc() work much more smoothly.

These changes were verified only on the Neuros OSD (ARM9) using a Linux development
environment. Please report any errors to me.

nuttx-0.4.0
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 32nd release of NuttX.  This release adds graphics support and a tiny
windowing subsystem.  That new graphics subystem is documented at
http://nuttx.sourceforge.net/NXGraphicsSubsystem.html.  No other substantial changes
were made.

These changes were verified only on the NuttX simulation platform with X11 windows
simulating a device framebuffer. Please report any errors to me.

The version number was bumped up to 0.4.0 in part to reflect the new graphics subsystem,
but also to recognize the NuttX is approaching complete functionality.  In the 0.3.x
versions, network support was added, Pascal P-code runtime support was added, FAT and
ROMFS filesystems were added, MMC/SD and USB device support were added.  There were
also numerous extensions to the NuttShell, NuttX APIs, and architecture ports.

nuttx-0.4.1
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 33rd release of NuttX.  This is a minor bugfix release.  The primary reason
for this release is to correct numerous build errors that have accumulated for the ZiLOG
ZDS-II based targets.  All ZDS-II targets now build correctly (but have not been re-tested).
In addition to platform-specific build failures,  release also adds the following features
which were not tested as of the time of the release:

	* Board support fot the ZiLog ez80Acclaim! ez80f910200zco Development Kit
	* ZiLOG eZ80F91 EMAC driver

These changes were verified only on the NuttX simulation platform. Please report any errors
to me.

nuttx-0.4.2
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 34th release of NuttX.  This release adds no new OS features but does include
support for two new architectures:

	* ez80Acclaim!  Basic support has been integrated and verified for the ez80f910200zcog-d
	  board (eZ80F91-based).  That basic support includes timer interrupts and serial
	  console.  Ongoing work includes an EMAC driver that should be integrated for
	  the next release nuttx-0.4.2.

	  eZ80Acclaim! support has been in the code base for some time, but has only just
	  been integrated due to toolchain issues.

	* Renesas M16C/20.  Support for the Renesas SKP16C20 board has been included in
	  the NuttX source tree.  However, as the eZ80Acclaim!, testing and integration
	  of that port is stalled due to toolchain issues.

These changes were verified only on the ZiLOG eZ80910200zcog-d board. Please report any errors
to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from Februrary 28, 2009.

nuttx-0.4.3
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 35th release of NuttX.  This release one important new OS feature and corrects
and extends the eZ80 port:

	* Priority Inheritance.  The basic NuttX waiting logic was extended to
	  support priority inheritance. See the NuttX User Manual for further
	  information: http://www.nuttx.org/NuttxUserGuide.html#priorityinheritance.
	* ez80Acclaim! Corrected several critical, show-stopping bugs on that
	  platform including: Errors in the serial driver intrrupts and an error
	  in the eZ80 table,.
	* eZ80Acclaim!: Completed integration of the eZ80F91 EMAC driver.

These changes were verified only on the ZiLOG eZ80910200zcog-d board and on Cygwin-based
simulation platform in various configurations. Please report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from March 13, 2009.

nuttx-0.4.4
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 36th release of NuttX.  This release focuses on bugfixes and extending
and verifying certain networking features.

	* Important bugs were fixed in NSH, UDP checksum calculation, UDP bind()
	  behavior for port==0, the eZ80Acclaim! EMAC driver, Z80 interrupt handling,
	  and in the C libraries.
	* Testing was extended to further verify the tiny webserver, DHCPD, wget(),
	  and sendmail.

See the Changelog for a detailed description of these changes.

These changes were verified only on the ZiLOG eZ80910200zcog-d board using the
ZDS-II toolchain in Cygwin-based environment. Please report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from March 29, 2009.

nuttx-0.4.5
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 37th release of NuttX.  This release focuses on a few new features.

	* The basic port for the FreeScale ARM920T i.MX1 processor on the
	  Freescale MX1ADS board.  Coding is complete for this port, but it is
	  has not yet fully integrated
	* Extended I2C and SPI interface definitions
	* Add basic support for C++ applications.  Very simple C++ applications
	  can now be built against NuttX without any external libraries.  At
	  present, only the most primitive C++ programs are supported, but it
	  is hoped that this support will be extended in future releases.

See the Changelog for a detailed description of these changes.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from April 19, 2009.

nuttx-0.4.6
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 38th release of NuttX.  The release features support for the Micromint
Eagle-100 development board.  This board is based around, the Luminary LM3S6918 MCU.
This is the first ARM Cortex-M3 architecture supported by Nuttx. This initial, basic
port includes timer and serial console with configurations to execute the NuttX OS
test and to run the NuttShell (NSH). Work is still underway on this port and current
plans are to have I2C, SSI, MMC/SD, and and Ethernet driver in the 0.4.7 release.

Additional work was done on the MXADS i.MX1 port, however, that work has been set
aside until I complete work on the Eagle-100 (I also need to come up with a 3V power
supply).

Other changes in this release include: Extensions to the SPI interface definition
in order to handle 9-bit interfaces to displays.  Several bugs were fixed (see the
ChangeLog for a complete list of changes).

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from May 19, 2009.

nuttx-0.4.7
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 39th release of NuttX.  This release focuses on cleaning up and
extending the Eagle100/LM3S6918 port released in nuttx-0.4.6 and on improved
MMC/SD support.  New features include:

  o Improved reliably and additional drivers for the Eagle-100 board (LM3S6918
    ARM Cortex-M3).  Additional drivers include Ethernet, SSI, and support for
    the on-board LEDs and microSD cards.
  o The SPI-based MMC/SD driver was extended to support SDHC Version 2.xx cards.

In addition, this release includes several important bugfixes for the LM3S6918,
the LPC2148, the SPI-based MMC/SD driver, and to FAT32.  See the ChangeLog for
details of these bugfixes.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from May 29, 2009.

nuttx-0.4.8
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 40th release of NuttX.  This release adds:

  o Support for the Olimex STRP711 board.  That board is based on the STMicro
    STR711 MCU (ARM7TDMI). Integration is complete on the basic port (boot logic,
    system time, serial console). Two configurations have been verified: (1) The
    board boots and passes the OS test with console output visible on UART0, and
    the NuttShell (NSH) is fully functional with interrupt driven serial console. 
    An SPI driver is available but untested (because the Olimex card slot appears
    to accept only MMC cards; I have only SD cards).  Additional needed: USB and
    driver, MMC integration.

  o Support for the CodeSourcery and devkitARM Windows-native GNU toolchains.
    Makefiles have been modified for the LM3S6918, LPC2148, and STR711 to support
    these toolchains under Cygwin.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from June 13, 2009.

nuttx-0.4.9
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 41st release of NuttX.  This release adds:

	* Support for a new binary format call NXFLAT that can be used to 
	  execute separately linked programs in place in a file system.
	  See http://www.nuttx.org/NuttXNxFlat.html.

	* Several important bugs were files related to networking and ROMFS
	  (see the ChangeLog for a complete list).

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from June 26, 2009.

nuttx-0.4.10
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 42nd release of NuttX.  This released focused on the port of Jeff
Poskanzer's THTTPD HTTP server (see http://acme.com/software/thttpd/.).  As of
the 0.4.10 release, that port is still not fully complete and functional.
However, numerous related bug-fixes and functional additions for THTTPD were
added:

	* Several new standard C-library functions (fileno, strstr, strpbrk, fcntl).
	* Improved and extended timing APIs (mktime, gmtime, gmtime_r, gettimeofday,
	  localtime, localtime_r, and strftime)
	* Networking enhancements: recvfrom and accept now work with non-blocking
	  sockets.
	* NXFLAT extensions (exec)
	* Pattern matching logic.
	* And miscellaneous bug fixes (see the ChangeLog for details).

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from August 8, 2009.

nuttx-0.4.11
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 43rd release of NuttX. This release of NuttX incorporates the
verified port of Jeff Poskanzer's THTTPD HTTP server (see http://acme.com/software/thttpd/.).
Many of the key features of THTTPD have been tested on the Micromint Eagle-100
development board (Cortex-M3).  These tests verify:

	* Serving of files from any file system
	* Execution of CGI executable.  This release supports execution of
	  NXFLAT executables on a ROMFS file system (http://www.nuttx.org/NuttXNxFlat.html)

A standard CGI interface is used:  Information is pasted to the CGI program via POST
commands and via environment variables.  CGI socket I/O is redirected to stdin and stdout
so that the CGI program only need to printf() to send its content back to the HTTP
client.

Another value to this THTTPD integration effort has been that THTTPD has provided a very
good test bed for finding NuttX networking bugs.  Several very critical networking bugs
have been fixed with this 0.4.11 release (see the ChangeLog for details).  Networking
throughput has also been greatly improved.  Anyone using NuttX networking should consider
upgrading to this release.
