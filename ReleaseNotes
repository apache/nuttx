NuttX Release Notes
===================

This file contains are the release notes for the NuttX (and apps) packages
for every release. The text is just as was written at the time of release
(with perhaps some corrected typos). Over the course of time, NuttX has
used several different repositories: CVS, two SVN repositories, and
currently a GIT repository. Therefore, revision information specific to an
older repository may not be meaningful today.

To make it easier to track there older versions in the current GIT
repository, a GIT lightweight tag has been applied for each release. The
tag name is the release name (for example, the release 6.27 has tag name
"nuttx-6.27").

The ReleaseNotes have moved to Documentation/ReleaseNotes/
