NuttX Release Notes
===================

This file contains are the release notes for the NuttX (and apps) packages
for every release.  The text is just as was written at the time of release
(with perhaps some corrected typos).  Over the course of time, NuttX has
used several different repositories:  CVS, two SVN repositories, and
currently a GIT repository.  Therefore, revision information specific to an
older repository may not be meaningful today.

To make it easier to track there older versions in the current GIT
repository, a GIT lightweight tag has been applied for each release.  The
tag name is the release name (for example, the release 6.27 has tag name
"nuttx-6.27").

NuttX-0.1.0
-----------

This is the initial.  This initial includes the complete NuttX RTOS
with support for the Linux user mode simulation and the TI TMS320C5471
(Arm7) processor.  Partial support for the 87C52 is included.

This release has been verified on both the Linux user-mode and C5471
platforms using the test program under examples/ostest.  Test results
for the C5471 can be found in arch/c5471/doc/test-results.txt.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from March 9,2007.

NuttX-0.1.1
-----------

This is the second release of NuttX.  This release includes the following.
See the ChangeLog for more detailed description of the changes.

(1) General OS bugfixes (see the ChangeLog for details),
(2) bugfixes for the TI TMS320C5471 (Arm7) platform (see
    the ChangeLog)
(3) Complete support for the 87C52. (However, the 87C52
    release is not stable enough for general usage).
(4) Added the beginning of a shell call NuttShell (nsh)

This release has been verified on the Linux user-mode platform, the
Spectrum Digital TMS320C5471 EVM, and the PJRC 87C52 development board

NuttX-0.3.0
-----------

This is the 12th release of NuttX.  This release includes the initial
integration of a network subsystem and the uIP TCP/IP stack into NuttX
(see http://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/index.php/Main_Page).  Also included
is a device driver for the Davicom DM90x0 Ethernet controller.

This integration is very preliminary.  Only a small portion of the
network functionality has been integrated and there are a number of
open issues (see the TODO file).  The network subsystem is pre-alpha
at this point in time.  I expect that it will stabilize and mature
over the next few releases.

The baseline functionality of NuttX continues to mature and remains at
post-beta (as long as the network is not used).

See the ChangeLog for a complete list of changes.

This release has been verified only on the Neuros OSD (DM320 ARM9)
platform using the DM90x0 driver.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from November 6, 2007.

NuttX-0.3.1
-----------

This is the 13th release of NuttX and the second release containing
the integration of a network subsystem and the uIP TCP/IP, UDP, and
ICMP stacks into NuttX (see http://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/index.php/Main_Page).

Many network-related problems have been fixed and the implementation
has matured significantly.  However, the level of network reliability
is probably still at the pre-alpha or early level.  It is sufficiently
complete that you may begin to perform some network integration and
is expected to achieve beta level of reliability over the next few
releases.

The baseline functionality of NuttX continues to mature and remains at
post-beta (as long as the network is not used).

See the ChangeLog for a complete list of changes.

This release has been verified only on the Neuros OSD (DM320 ARM9)
platform using the DM90x0 driver.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from November 19, 2007.

NuttX-0.3.2
-----------

This is the 14th release of NuttX and the 3rd release containing
the integration of a network subsystem and the uIP TCP/IP, UDP, and
ICMP stacks into NuttX (see http://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/index.php/Main_Page).

Many network-related problems have been fixed and the implementation
has matured significantly.  This release consists of:

o TCP-related bug-fixes
o TCP performance improvements
o Initial UDP integration
o Initial uIP micro webserver integration

See the ChangeLog for a complete list of changes.

The level of network reliability is at alpha level is expected to
achieve beta level of reliability over the next few releases.

The baseline functionality of NuttX continues to mature and remains at
post-beta.

This release has been verified only on the Neuros OSD (DM320 ARM9)
platform using the DM90x0 driver.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from November 23, 2007.

NuttX-0.3.3
-----------

This is the 15th release of NuttX and the 4th release containing
the integration of a network subsystem and the uIP TCP/IP, UDP, and
ICMP stacks into NuttX (see http://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/index.php/Main_Page).

Many network-related problems have been fixed and the implementation
has matured significantly.  This release consists of:

o TCP-related bug-fixes for disconnecting sockets
o Correction of some TCP read-ahead logic
o TCP performance improvements
o Misc. additions and cleanup (See the ChangeLog for a complete list of
  changes).

The level of network reliability is at an early beta release level.  The
baseline functionality of NuttX continues to mature and remains at
post-beta. Open network-related issues include only:

o Some minor unimplemented BSD socket functionality,
o Thread safety issues: the same socket cannot be used concurrently on
  different threads.
o Pending design changes necessary to support multiple network interfaces.
o IPv6 support is incomplete.

This release has been verified only on the Neuros OSD (DM320 ARM9)
platform using the DM90x0 driver. Any feedback for improving the network
reliability/performance would be greatly appreciated.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from November 28, 2007.

NuttX-0.3.4
-----------

This is the 16th release of NuttX and the 5th release containing
the integration of a network subsystem and the uIP TCP/IP, UDP, and
ICMP stacks into NuttX (see http://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/index.php/Main_Page).

This release is primarily a bug-fix release.  New features include
only:

o TELNET front-end to NSH,
o DHCPC server functionality, and
o C5471 Ethernet driver.

Numerous network related problems were fixed related to DHCPC, UDP
input processing, UDP broadcast, send timeouts, and bad compilation when
uIP is compiled at high levels of optimization.

The level of network reliability is at a strong beta release level.  The
baseline functionality of NuttX continues to mature and remains at
post-beta or production level.

Parts of this release were verified only on the Neuros OSD (DM320 ARM9)
platform using the DM90x0 Ethernet driver and other parts on the Spectrum
Digital C5471 EVM using the C5471 Ethernet driver. Any feedback about bugs
or suggestions for improving the network reliability/performance would be
greatly appreciated.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from December 10, 2007.

NuttX-0.3.5
-----------

This is the 17th release of NuttX this release is primarily a bug-fix
release and intended to synchronize with the current CVS contents.  See
the ChangeLog for a detailed list of changes and fixes.

This release were verified only on the Spectrum Digital C5471 EVM using
the C5471 Ethernet driver. Any feedback about bugs or suggestions for
improvement would be greatly appreciated.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from December 18, 2007.

NuttX-0.3.6
-----------

This is the 18th release of NuttX.  This release contains on a few
changes.  The primary purpose of this release is to synchronize with
the release of the pascal-0.1.0 add-on package.

This release of NuttX includes the following changes:

* Fixes for use with SDCC compiler
* Added a simulated z80 target (arch/z80)
* Fix deadlock errors when using stdio but with no buffering
* Add support for the add-on Pascal P-Code interpreter (pcode/)
  (see the pascal-0.1.0 package)

This release were verified only on the simulated Z80 and and host
simulation targets.  As usual, any feedback about bugs or suggestions
for improvement would be greatly appreciated.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from January 6, 2007.

====

There was an error in the initial 0.3.6 release that prevented
a successful build unless the Pascal add-on was present.  The
tarball was patched to include the fix.  Make sure that you download
the nuttx-0.3.6.1.tar.gz version to avoid this problem.

NuttX-0.3.7
-----------

This is the 19th release of NuttX.  This release includes the
preliminary port of NuttX to the ZiLOG z16f 16-bit microcontroller.
This port was verified using the ZiLOG z16f2800100zcog Development
and the ZiLOG ZDS-II toolchain. See http://www.zilog.com for
further information.

I emphasize that this is a preliminary release of the z16f port and
is only alpha or, perhaps, pre-alpha quality as of this writing.
There are a list of known issues in the TODO file in the root of
the NuttX directory.  The overall quality of NuttX (excluding the
z16f port) continues to improve beyond the late beta level.

The z16f port required numerous changes to NuttX to handle:

* NEAR and FAR addressing, and
* Use of a Windows native toolchain in a Cygwin build environment.

In addition to the z16f port, at least one very critical bug was
found and corrected in NuttX:  The thread-specific errno value of one
task was being randomly trashed when a different thread exited.

This release were verified on the ZiLOG z16f2800100zcog, Neuros OSD
(ARM9), and the simulation platforms.  As usual, any feedback about bugs
or suggestions for improvement would be greatly appreciated.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from January 31, 2008.

NuttX-0.3.8
-----------

This is the 20th release of NuttX.  This is a minor bugfix release.
It corrects a few minor problems, adds a few minor features, and
continues the integration of the ZiLOG Z18F and of the Pascal P-Code
add-on.  This release is synchronized with the release of Pascal-0.1.2.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from February 10, 2008.

NuttX-0.3.9
-----------

This is the 21st release of NuttX.  This is a minor future enhancement
release.  This release includes support for the ZiLOG Z8Encore! micro-
controller.  Also included is the initial framework for support for
the Z80, XTRS platform (http://www.tim-mann.org/xtrs.html).

This released has been verified only on the ZiLOG ZDS-II Z8Encore!
chip simulation.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from March 9, 2008.

NuttX-0.3.10
------------

This is the 22nd release of NuttX.  This is an important bug fix
release.  This release incorporates fixes to correct critical list
handling errors in task shutdown logic: One in timer deletion logic
(timer_delete.c) and one in stream logic (lib_init.c).  This release
also includes support to ZiLOG EZ80Acclaim microcontroller (EZ80F91
chip) and configurations for the ZiLOG z8f64200100kit (Z8F6423) and
ez80f0910200kitg (EZ80F091) development kit.

any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from September 1, 2008.

nutt-0.3.14
-----------

This is the 26th release of NuttX.  This release includes some
important bugfixes as well as a few new features.  Critical bugs
fixed include:

FAT FS:
  * Fixed several critical bugs with regard to fat reading and
    writing and FAT12 accesses.  Basically the FAT FS only worked
    with my tiny test files and test cases.  A lot of stronger FAT
    tested is still needed!
  * Fixed another FAT bug in implementation of FAT lseek();
    this prohibited correct random access to large files.

Network:
  * Corrected a critical bug that may prevent recvfrom from receiving
    packets from most remote UDP port numbers.
  * Corrected an error in multi-threaded socket handling in send() and
    sendto().  Outgoing data could overwrite incoming data.
  * Corrected IP checksum calculation in ICMP and UDP message send logic.
  * Corrected an error in send() timeout logic.

New features were also added:

Network:
  * Added support for application access to ICMP protocol stacks
  * Added ping request logic (net/uip).
  * Added basic TFTP client logic (netutils/tftpc).

NuttShell (NSH):
  * New commands: 'test', '[', 'ping', 'mkrd', 'xd', and TFTP 'get' and 'put'
    See the new NuttShell User Guide for additional information.

Other less critical bugs were also fixed and other less important
features were were added.  See the ChangeLog for details.

These changes were verified only on the Neuros OSD (ARM9).  Please
report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from September 8, 2008.

nutt-0.3.15
-----------

This is the 27th release of NuttX.  This release includes some new features:

* Adds support for the ROMFS filesystem
* ROMFS supports mmap() to provide eXecute In Place (XIP) capability
* NuttShell (NSH) can be configured to use ROMFS to provide a tiny read-only
  filesystem with a startup script in /etc.
* Completed the basic port of the NXP LPC2148 on the mcu123.com board.
  The basic port includes successful booting, timer interrupts,
  serial console, successfully passing the examples/ostest, and a
  NuttShell (NSH) configuration.

These changes were verified only on the mcu123.com NXP LPC2148
board.  Please report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from September 20, 2008.

nutt-0.3.16
-----------

This is the 28th release of NuttX.  This release includes the first
support for USB in NuttX.  A set of USB APIs were added to support
USB device controller drivers and bindings to USB device class
drivers.  The form of the interface was inspired by the Linux Gadget APIs.

At present USB device controller drivers are included for:
  * The NXP LPC214x.  This driver has been verified and is an early alpha
    stage in quality.
  * TI DM320.  Coding for this driver is complete but it is completely
    untested as of this release.

A controller-independent class driver is also included for:
  * USB serial class device driver (emulates the Prolific PL2303
    serial-to-USB adapter).  This driver has only been verified with
    the Linux host PL2303 driver.

Other new features include:
  * Add an option to set aside a separate stack for interrupt
    handling (ARM only).  This is useful when memory is constrained,
    there are multiple tasks, and the interrupt stack requirement
    is high (as when USB is enabled).

A few bugs were also fixed:
  * Fixed the frequency of system timer interrupts in the NXP LPC214x port
    (off by 20x in nuttx-0.3.15)
  * Fixed serial driver bugs related to (1) open counts and (2) recognizing
    O_NONBLOCK on read.
  * Fixed an error in read(); it was not setting the errno on errors returned
    from the driver.

These changes were verified only on the mcu123.com NXP LPC2148 board
using with a Linux host.  Please report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from October 10, 2008.

UPDATE
------
This release does not build for the ARM target when USB is disabled.
Here is the fix:

NuttX-0.3.17
------------

This is the 29th release of NuttX.  This release includes the
additional support for USB in NuttX.  The following new features
were added:

* Added support for SPI-based MMC/SD cards (with an SPI driver
  for the NXP LPC214x).
* Added USB storage class device side driver (BBB)
* Added an example that demonstrates the USB storage class by
  exporting the SPI based MMC/SD card on the NXP LPC214x.

This is an early alpha release of these drivers.  At present they
only work with debug features enabled so there are probably some
race conditions that occur only with debug features disabled.
(Anyone out there with a USB analyzer?  I would love to know what
is happening.)

Several important bugs were also fixed in the FAT file system, USB
serial driver and NXP LPC214x USB controller driver. (See the ChangeLog
for details.)

These changes were verified only on the mcu123.com NXP LPC2148 board
using a Linux development environment.  USB testing was performed
using both a Linux host and a WinXP host.  Please report any errors
to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from October 28, 2008.

NuttX-0.3.18
------------

This is the 30th release of NuttX.  This release includes two
partially completed ports, several new features, and a couple of
important bug fixes.  The two partially completed ports are:

  * The STMicro STR71x processor and configuration for the Olimex
    STR-P711 board.
  * The Hitachi SH-1 using the SH1_LCEVB1 (SH-1/US7032EVB1) board

Progress on these ports is stalled (as detailed in the ChangeLog).

The new features focus primarily on management of block devices and
extensions of the NuttShell (NSH).  These include:

  * A loop device that converts a file into a block device.
  * A block to character (BCH) driver that  allow access a block device as
    if it were character device.
  * Added strcasecmp() and strncasecmp() libc functions.
  * Added the 'dd' and 'losetup' commands to NSH. These commands
    (along with mkfatfs and mount), give good management of filesystems
    on the target.

Several bugs were fixed, the most important of which are:

  * Fixed a race condition workaround delay in LPC214X SPI logic.
    This was also the cause of some bad MMC/SD performance on that
    platform.

  * Fixed a recently introduced FAT file system problem: It would
    mount a (invalid) FAT file system even if the medium is not formatted!

  * Corrected two other important errors in the FAT lseek() implementation:
    1 - The sectors-per-cluster value was being reset to "1".
    2 - Important lseek logic was omitted when the seek position was zero.

The FAT filesystem has had many bugs fixed in it and, I think, is
now maturing and becoming stable.

These changes were verified only on the mcu123.com NXP LPC2148
board, the Hitachi SH1_LCEVB1 board, and the Linux simulator, all
using a Linux development environment.  Please report any errors
to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from November 16, 2008.

NuttX-0.3.19
------------

This is the 31st release of NuttX.  This release includes the
following new feature:

  * Add poll() and select() APIs that may be used to monitor for
    data availability on character devices or TCP/IP sockets.
  * Implemented support TCP/IP connection backlog.  This allows
    select() to wake-up on new connections to a listener socket.
  * Added definition of a framebuffer driver and implement framebuffer
    drivers for the simulated platform and the TI DM320 (untested
    as of the initial check-in).
  * Partially developed a graphics framework based on the framebuffer
    drivers, however, this will not be ready for use for a few more
    releases.  Currently this includes only a few color conversion
    routines and some rasterizing functions.  A tiny windowing system
    is under development but not ready for check-in yet.
  * Added support for fixed precision math.
  * Added support for outgoing multicast packets.

Several bugs were fixed, the most important of which are:

  * Fixed an important bug in the TCP/IP buffering logic.  When
    TCP/IP read-ahead is enabled and not recv() is in-place when a
    TCP/IP packet is received, the packet is placed into a read-ahead
    buffer.  However, the old contents of the read-ahead buffer
    were not being cleared and old data would contaminate the newly
    received buffer.

  * Changed the behavior of the serial driver read.  It now returns
    data as it is available rather than waiting for the full requested
    read size.  This makes functions like fgetc() work much more
    smoothly.

These changes were verified only on the Neuros OSD (ARM9) using a
Linux development environment. Please report any errors to me.

NuttX-0.4.0
-----------

This is the 32nd release of NuttX.  This release adds graphics
support and a tiny windowing subsystem.  That new graphics subsystem
is documented at http://nuttx.sourceforge.net/NXGraphicsSubsystem.html.
No other substantial changes were made.

These changes were verified only on the NuttX simulation platform
with X11 windows simulating a device framebuffer. Please report any
errors to me.

The version number was bumped up to 0.4.0 in part to reflect the
new graphics subsystem, but also to recognize the NuttX is approaching
complete functionality.  In the 0.3.x versions, network support was
added, Pascal P-code runtime support was added, FAT and ROMFS
filesystems were added, MMC/SD and USB device support were added.
There were also numerous extensions to the NuttShell, NuttX APIs,
and architecture ports.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from December 6, 2008.

NuttX-0.4.1
-----------

This is the 33rd release of NuttX.  This is a minor bugfix release.
The primary reason for this release is to correct numerous build
errors that have accumulated for the ZiLOG ZDS-II based targets.
All ZDS-II targets now build correctly (but have not been re-tested).
In addition to platform-specific build failures, this release also
adds the following features which were not tested as of the time
of the release:

  * Board support for the ZiLog ez80Acclaim! ez80f910200zco Development Kit
  * ZiLOG eZ80F91 EMAC driver

These changes were verified only on the NuttX simulation platform.
Please report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from February 6, 2009.

NuttX-0.4.2
-----------

This is the 34th release of NuttX.  This release adds no new OS
features but does include support for two new architectures:

  * ez80Acclaim!  Basic support has been integrated and verified
    for the ez80f910200zcog-d board (eZ80F91-based).  That basic
    support includes timer interrupts and serial console.  Ongoing
    work includes an EMAC driver that should be integrated for the
    next release nuttx-0.4.2.  eZ80Acclaim! support has been in the
    code base for some time, but has only just been integrated due
    to toolchain issues.

  * Renesas M16C/20.  Support for the Renesas SKP16C20 board has
    been included in the NuttX source tree.  However, as the
    eZ80Acclaim!, testing and integration of that port is stalled
    due to toolchain issues.

These changes were verified only on the ZiLOG eZ80910200zcog-d
board. Please report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from February 28, 2009.

NuttX-0.4.3
-----------

This is the 35th release of NuttX.  This release one important new
OS feature and corrects and extends the eZ80 port:

  * Priority Inheritance.  The basic NuttX waiting logic was extended
    to support priority inheritance. See the NuttX User Manual for
    further information:
    http://www.nuttx.org/NuttxUserGuide.html#priorityinheritance.

  * ez80Acclaim! Corrected several critical, show-stopping bugs on that
    platform including:
    - Errors in the serial driver interrupts.
    - An error in the eZ80 table.
  * eZ80Acclaim!: Completed integration of the eZ80F91 EMAC driver.

These changes were verified only on the ZiLOG eZ80910200zcog-d board
and on Cygwin-based simulation platform in various configurations.
Please report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from March 13, 2009.

NuttX-0.4.4
-----------

This is the 36th release of NuttX.  This release focuses on bugfixes
and extending and verifying certain networking features.

  * Important bugs were fixed in NSH, UDP checksum calculation, UDP
    bind() behavior for port==0, the eZ80Acclaim! EMAC driver, Z80
    interrupt handling, and in the C libraries.

  * Testing was extended to further verify the tiny webserver,
    DHCPD, wget(), and sendmail.

See the Changelog for a detailed description of these changes.

These changes were verified only on the ZiLOG eZ80910200zcog-d board
using the ZDS-II toolchain in Cygwin-based environment. Please
report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from March 29, 2009.

NuttX-0.4.5
-----------

This is the 37th release of NuttX.  This release focuses on a few new features.

  * The basic port for the Freescale ARM920T i.MX1 processor on the
    Freescale MX1ADS board.  Coding is complete for this port, but
    it is has not yet fully integrated
  * Extended I2C and SPI interface definitions
  * Add basic support for C++ applications.  Very simple C++
    applications can now be built against NuttX without any external
    libraries.  At present, only the most primitive C++ programs
    are supported, but it is hoped that this support will be extended
    in future releases.

See the Changelog for a detailed description of these changes.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from April 19, 2009.

NuttX-0.4.6
-----------

This is the 38th release of NuttX.  The release features support
for the Micromint Eagle-100 development board.  This board is based
around, the Luminary LM3S6918 MCU.  This is the first ARM Cortex-M3
architecture supported by Nuttx. This initial, basic port includes
timer and serial console with configurations to execute the NuttX
OS test and to run the NuttShell (NSH). Work is still underway on
this port and current plans are to have I2C, SSI, MMC/SD, and and
Ethernet driver in the 0.4.7 release.

Additional work was done on the MXADS i.MX1 port, however, that
work has been set aside until I complete work on the Eagle-100 (I
also need to come up with a 3V power supply).

Other changes in this release include: Extensions to the SPI interface
definition in order to handle 9-bit interfaces to displays.  Several
bugs were fixed (see the ChangeLog for a complete list of changes).

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from May 19, 2009.

NuttX-0.4.7
-----------

This is the 39th release of NuttX.  This release focuses on cleaning
up and extending the Eagle100/LM3S6918 port released in nuttx-0.4.6
and on improved MMC/SD support.  New features include:

  * Improved reliably and additional drivers for the Eagle-100 board
    (LM3S6918 ARM Cortex-M3).  Additional drivers include Ethernet,
    SSI, and support for the on-board LEDs and microSD cards.

  * The SPI-based MMC/SD driver was extended to support SDHC Version
    2.xx cards.

In addition, this release includes several important bugfixes for
the LM3S6918, the LPC2148, the SPI-based MMC/SD driver, and to
FAT32.  See the ChangeLog for details of these bugfixes.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from May 29, 2009.

NuttX-0.4.8
-----------

This is the 40th release of NuttX.  This release adds:

  * Support for the Olimex STRP711 board.  That board is based on
    the STMicro STR711 MCU (ARM7TDMI). Integration is complete on
    the basic port (boot logic, system time, serial console). Two
    configurations have been verified: (1) The board boots and
    passes the OS test with console output visible on UART0, and
    the NuttShell (NSH) is fully functional with interrupt driven
    serial console.  An SPI driver is available but untested (because
    the Olimex card slot appears to accept only MMC cards; I have
    only SD cards).  Additional needed: USB and driver, MMC
    integration.

  * Support for the CodeSourcery and devkitARM Windows-native GNU
    toolchains.  Makefiles have been modified for the LM3S6918,
    LPC2148, and STR711 to support these toolchains under Cygwin.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from June 13, 2009.

NuttX-0.4.9
-----------

This is the 41st release of NuttX.  This release adds:

  * Support for a new binary format call NXFLAT that can be used to
    execute separately linked programs in place in a file system.
    See http://www.nuttx.org/NuttXNxFlat.html.

  * Several important bugs were files related to networking and ROMFS.
    See the ChangeLog for a complete list.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from June 26, 2009.

NuttX-0.4.10
-----------

This is the 42nd release of NuttX.  This released focused on the
port of Jeff Poskanzer's THTTPD HTTP server (see
http://acme.com/software/thttpd/).  As of the 0.4.10 release, that
port is still not fully complete and functional.  However, numerous
related bug-fixes and functional additions for THTTPD were added:

  * Several new standard C-library functions (fileno, strstr,
    strpbrk, fcntl).
  * Improved and extended timing APIs (mktime, gmtime, gmtime_r,
    gettimeofday, localtime, localtime_r, and strftime)
  * Networking enhancements: recvfrom() and accept() now work with
    non-blocking sockets.
  * NXFLAT extensions (exec)
  * Pattern matching logic.
  * And miscellaneous bug fixes (see the ChangeLog for details).

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from August 8, 2009.

NuttX-0.4.11
------------

This is the 43rd release of NuttX. This release of NuttX incorporates
the verified port of Jeff Poskanzer's THTTPD HTTP server (see
http://acme.com/software/thttpd/).  Many of the key features of
THTTPD have been tested on the Micromint Eagle-100 development board
(Cortex-M3).  These tests verify:

  * Serving of files from any file system
  * Execution of CGI executable.  This release supports execution
    of NXFLAT executables on a ROMFS file system
    (http://www.nuttx.org/NuttXNxFlat.html)

A standard CGI interface is used:  Information is pasted to the CGI
program via POST commands and via environment variables.  CGI socket
I/O is redirected to stdin and stdout so that the CGI program only
need to printf() to send its content back to the HTTP client.

Another value to this THTTPD integration effort has been that THTTPD
has provided a very good test bed for finding NuttX networking bugs.
Several very critical networking bugs have been fixed with this
0.4.11 release (see the ChangeLog for details).  Networking throughput
has also been greatly improved.  Anyone using NuttX networking
should consider upgrading to this release.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from September 16, 2009

NuttX-0.4.12
------------

This is the 44th release of NuttX.  This release adds basic support
for the STMicro STM32, Cortex-M3 MCU.  The specific port is to the
STMicro STM3210E-EVAL development board based around the STM32F103ZET6
MCU.  Some highlights of this port:

  * This basic port includes boot-up logic, interrupt driven serial
    console, and system timer interrupts.
  * Includes a basic STMicro RIDE7 project that can be used to
    perform basic STM32 board bring-up (due to RIDE7 size limitations,
    it cannot be used for the full NuttX bring-up).
  * Working, Tested Configurations: the NuttX OS test and the
    NuttShell (NSH) example.

This basic STM32 port will be extended in the 0.4.13 NuttX release.
Functionality needed for complete STM32 support includes:  USB
device driver, LCD driver and NX bringup on the development board's
display and MicroSD support.  An SPI driver and a DMA support was
included in this 0.4.12 release, but is not yet tested.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from October 17, 2009

NuttX-0.4.13
------------

This is the 45th release of NuttX.  The release extends the support
for the STMicro STM32 microcontroller.  Minimal support for the
STM3210E-EVAL development board based around the STM32F103ZET6 MCU
was released in NuttX-0.4.12.  This release adds:

  * A simple interface definition to support some FLASH, EEPROM,
    NVRAM, etc. devices.
  * Verified SPI operation using driver for SPI based FLASH parts
    M25P64 and M25P128.
  * Improved Cortex-M3 context switching.  This should improve
    context switching performance be 2x in certain cases.
  * Added a USB device-side driver for the STM32.  This is an early
    release of a very complex driver; some bugs are expected.
  * The USB driver has been verified against the USB serial device
    class driver.  There is at least one known outstanding issue
    (see the full bug description in the TODO list).

This release also corrects some important bugs in the early STM32 release:

  * Fixed several errors the prevented operation of NuttX on an
    STM32 development board using USART2 as the serial console.
  * Fixed and optimization-dependent race condition in the clock
    initialization.
  * Fixed a critical bug in the interrupt control logic that could
    cause interrupt operations to failed used for interrupts in a
    certain range.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from November 4, 2009

NuttX-4.14
----------

This is the 46th release of NuttX.  The release extends the support
for the STMicro STM32 microcontroller.  Minimal support for the
STM3210E-EVAL development board based around the STM32F103ZET6 MCU
was released in NuttX-0.4.12 and extended in Nuttx-0.4.13 to include
initial USB support.  This completes the STM32F103ZET6 and adds:

New Generic RTOS Features:

  * Added generic support that can be included in any block driver
    to provide read-ahead buffering and write buffering for improved
    driver performance.
  * Added a generic worker thread that can used to defer processing
    from an interrupt to a task.
  * Defined a generic SD/SDIO interface can can be bound to a MMC/SD
    or SDIO driver to provide SDIO support.
  * Implemented a an SDIO-based MMC/SD driver using this new SDIO
    interface.

New STM32 Features:

  * Add support to configure an STM32 input GPIO to generate an
    EXTI interrupt.
  * Added support for buttons on the STM3210E-EVAL board.
  * Implemented an STM32 version of the common the SDIO interface.
  * Added a configuration to exercise the STM32 with the USB mass
    storage device class example.

This release also corrects some important bugs in the early STM32 release:

  * Correct error handling in the mount() logic.
  * Fixed several STM32 DMA-related issues. Integrated and debugged
    STM32 DMA functionality that was added in 0.4.12.
  * Fixed several bugs in the STM32 USB device-side driver.

NOTE:  This version, 4.14, is equivalent to what would have been
called 0.4.14 to follow 0.4.13.  The zero has been eliminated from
the front of the version number to avoid confusion about the state
of development:  Some have interpreted the leading zero to mean
that the code is in some way unstable.  That was not the intent.
Beginning in January 2010, I will switch to the 2010.nn versioning
as many others have done to avoid such confusion.

NuttX-5.0
---------

This is 47th release of NuttX and the successor to nuttx-4.14.  This
major revision number has been incremented to indicate that an
incompatibility with previous nuttx releases has been introduced.
This version adopts standard fixed width integer names as specified
by the ANSI C99 standard.  The core logic of NuttX is older than
that standard and did not conform to it.

If you have applications running on NuttX-4.14, those applications
should continue to build and execute without problem on NuttX-5.0.
However, if you have device drivers or other OS-internal logic, you
will probably have to make some minor changes to your code to use
this version.  Below is a summary of those changes:

  * If you include sys/types.h to get the non-standard, fixed width
    integer types (uint32, uint16, ubyte, etc.), that is no longer
    necessary.
  * Instead, you will need to include stdint.h where the new fixed
    width integer types are defined (uint32_t, uint16_t, uint8_t, etc).
  * You will have to change all occurrences of the following types:

    uint32 -> uint32_t
    uint16 -> uint16_t
    ubyte  -> uint8_t
    uint8  -> uint8_t
    sint32 -> int32_t
    sint16 -> int16_t
    sint8  -> int8_t

 * In addition, the non-standard type 'boolean' must replaced with
   the standard type 'bool'.  The type definition for 'bool' is in
   stdbool.h

This change in typing caused small changes to many, many files.  It
was verified that all configurations in the release still build
correctly (other than the SDCC-based configurations).  Regression
testing was performed on a few configurations, but it is possible
that minor build issues still exist. (If you encounter any, please
let me know and I will help you to fix them.)

In the course of the regression testing, several important bugs
unrelated to the type changes were found and corrected.

  * Fixed an important error in the RX FIFO handling logic of the
    LM3S6918 Ethernet driver.
  * Corrected the handling of TCP sequence numbers in the TCP stack.
  * And other less important bugs as detailed in the ChangeLog.

The primary focus of this release was standards compatibility, but
a few new features were added including a (1) Flash Translation
Layer (FTL) that will support filesystems on a FLASH device and (2)
partial ports for the STM32F107VC and HCS12 C9S12NE64 MCUs.  Those
ports are very incomplete as of this writing.

NuttX-5.1
---------

This is the 48th release of NuttX.  This release adds support for
two new MCU architectures in various states of development:

* AT91SAM3U (http://www.atmel.com/products/at91/sam3landing.asp?family_id=605)

  This release adds support for the SAM3U-EK development board with
  the AT91SAM3U4E MCU
  (http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card_mcu.asp?part_id=4562).
  As with most NuttX architecture releases, the release will be
  rolled out in two parts:  A basic port and an extended port.

  NuttX-5.1 includes the basic port for the SAM3U-EK board.  This
  release passes the NuttX OS test and is proven to have a valid
  OS implementation.  It supports the basic boot-up, serial console
  and timer interrupts.  A configuration to support the NuttShell
  is also included.

  The extended port will also include support for SDIO-based SD
  cards and USB device (and possible LCD support).  These extensions
  may or may not happen by the Nuttx 5.2 release as my plate is
  kind of full now.

* LPC3131 (http://ics.nxp.com/products/lpc3000/lpc313x.lpc314x.lpc315x/)

  This release also adds the complete implementation of the basic
  port for the NXP LPC3131 MCU on the Embedded Artists EA3131 board
  (http://www.embeddedartists.com/products/kits/lpc3131_kit.php).
  That port, unfortunately has stalled due to tools issues.  Those
  tool issues have been resolved and I am confident that the verified
  basic port will be available in NuttX-5.2.

  The extended release will follow and should include SDIO-based
  SD card support and device USB.

A few additional features and bugfixes of a minor nature were also
incorporated as detailed in the ChangeLog.

NuttX-5.2
---------

This is the 49th release of NuttX.  This release completes the
verification of the basic port for the NXP LPC3131 MCU on the
Embedded Artists EA3131 board
(http://www.embeddedartists.com/products/kits/lpc3131_kit.php).
This basic port includes basic boot-up, serial console, and timer
interrupts.  This port has been verified on the using the NuttX OS
test and includes a working implementation of the NuttShell (NSH).

An extended release will follow and should include SDIO-based SD
card support and device USB.

NuttX-5.3
---------

This is the 50th release of NuttX.  This release support for one new
architecture:

  * A basic port for the NXP LPC2378 MCU on the Olimex-LPC2378
    development board was contributed by Rommel Marcelo.

And extensions to two existing architectures:

  * David Hewson contributed a dual-speed (full/high) USB device-side
    driver for the NXP LPC3131 on the Embedded Artists EA3131
    development board.

  * A DMA driver and a high speed MCI driver for the Atmel AT91SAM3U
    are included (but not fully tested in this release).

Two important bugfix was also included:

  * An important fix to the USB mass storage driver was contributed
    by David Hewson.
  * A serious error in the AT91SAM3U PIO handling was fixed.

NuttX-5.4
---------

This is the 51st release of NuttX.  This release includes one new,
important extension to th NX graphics system (See
http://www.nuttx.org/NXGraphicsSubsystem.html).

NX was develop a couple years back on hardware that supported only
framebuffer devices, that is, video hardware with video memory
directly converts the memory content to video.  However, most MCUs
that NuttX focuses on do not support such video memory; rather,
that typically only support LCDs via parallel or serial interfaces.

This release of NuttX extends NX so that now renders directly to
the LCD device via its serial or parallel interface.  No in-memory
copy of the screen memory need be maintained so this solution should
also work in MCUs with very limited SRAM.

This initial release of this feature includes the verified NX
extensions plus a driver for the HX8347, 16-bit parallel LCD.  This
LCD supports 16-bit RGB (5:6:5).

NuttX-5.5
---------

This is the 52nd release of NuttX.  This release includes one new
port, some new drivers and some important bugfixes:

  * NuttX was ported to the Luminary/TI LM3S6965 Ethernet Evaluation
    Kit.  At present, that port includes an OS test configuration
    and a NuttShell (NSH) configuration with Telnet support.

    MMC/SD and Networking support are provided but not thoroughly
    verified in this release: Current development efforts are focused
    on porting the NuttX window system (NX) to work with the
    Evaluation Kits OLED display.

  * A NuttX Ethernet driver for the Microchip ENC28J60 SPI Ethernet
    chip is available in the source tree (but has not yet been fully
    verified because I haven't properly connected it to hardware
    yet).

  * The Olimex STR-P711 NuttX port was extended to support the
    ENC28J60 and some new networking configurations were added.
    The ENC28J60 has not been tested on the STR-P711, however,
    because of hardware issues (I don't think the USB powered board
    provides enough power for the ENC28J60 and I don't have the
    right wall wart yet).

    Along the way, external interrupt support (XTI) was added to
    the STMicro STR-P711 port and some important bugs were fixed
    in the STR-P711 SPI driver.

  * Added (optional) floating point support for printf().
    (Contributed by Yolande Cates.)

  * Corrected an important UDP reference counting error.  It was
    not a serious error, but it trigger an assertion was IS a serious
    error.

NuttX-5.6
---------

This is the 53rd release of NuttX.  This release includes one several
new drivers for existing NuttX ports:

  * This port adds support for the RiT displays P14201 4-bpp,
    greyscale OLED.  4-bpp greyscale support was integrated into
    the NX graphics sub-system and verified using the TI/Luminary
    LP3S6965 Ethernet Evaluation Kit.

  * The M25Px driver was extended for the M24P1 FLASH part (see NOTE).

  * An I2C driver and (basic) SPI driver were added for the NXP
    LPC313x port.  The I2C interface definition was extended to
    efficiently handle multiple I2C transfers.
    (Contributed by David Hewson.)

As well as a few, important USB-related bugfixes (See the ChangeLog
for details).

This release also includes the beginnings of a port for the NXP
LPC1768 MCU.  However, it is too early for that port to be useful
(stay tuned for a future announce of the availability of the LPC1768
port).

NuttX-5.7
---------

This is the 54th release of NuttX.  This release adds basic support
for one new ARM Cortex-M3 architecture:

  * Added support for NXP LPC1768 MCU as provided on the Nucleus
    2G board from 2G Engineering (http://www.2g-eng.com).
  * Some initial files for the LPC17xx family were released in NuttX
    5.6, but the first functional release for the NXP LPC1768/Nucleus2G
    occurred with NuttX 5.7.
  * That initial basic release included timer interrupts and a
    serial console and was verified using the NuttX OS test.
  * That release includes a verified NuttShell (NSH) configuration
    (see the http://www.nuttx.org/NuttShell.html).
  * Also included are unverified SPI and USB device drivers.

Further efforts include:
  (1) development of a DMA support library
  (2) SPI-based MMC/SD support
  (3) verification of the USB driver

Watch for announcement of the completed LPC1768 port expected in
NuttX-5.8.

NuttX-5.8
---------

This is the 55th release of NuttX.  This includes several important
bugfixes:

  * Corrects some interrupt vectoring for the TI/Stellarix LM3S
    port
  * Correct initialization logic for NXP LPC17xxx NuttX ports:
    Power was not being provided to the GPIO module!
  * Corrected (but did not verify) implementation of the optional
    interrupt stack feature (all Cortex M3 architectures).
  * Correct a HardFault in the LPC17xx SSP driver.

Additional minor fixes are also included as detailed in the ChangeLog.

Several new features have been fully developed and included in this
release, but full verification of most of these new features has
been blocked for a variety of issues:

  * Added microSD support for the NuttShell (NSH) configuration in
    the Nucleus2G LPC1768 port.  For reasons that have not yet been
    determined, I have not successfully accessed the microSD card
    as of this writing.
  * Two USB configurations were also added for the Nucleus2G board:
    One to support the USB serial device and one for the USB mass
    storage device.  Some testing of the USB driver was performed,
    but full verification is stalled for an OTG style USB cable.
  * LEDs now work correctly on the Nucleus2G LPC1768 board.
  * The NuttX/uIP networking subsystem now supports IGMPv2 client.
    IGMP (Internet Group Multicast Protocol) network "appliances"
    to join into multicast groups.  Outbound traffic to enter and
    leave multicast groups has been verified, but full verification
    will require a switch capable of multicast.  Issues associated
    with the receipt of multicast packets are likely.

NuttX-5.9
---------

This is the 56th release of NuttX.  This release is difficult to
categorize; NuttX-5.9 was really released because there were too
many changes accumulating in CVS -- a few important, some unfinished
implementations, and a couple of important bugfixes.

  * By far biggest change in this release is the complete implementation
    of on-demand paging support.  This feature will allow you to
    execute large programs on a mass storage device (such as SPI
    FLASH) in a small RAM.  All of the core on-demand paging logic
    was completed (see http://www.nuttx.org/NuttXDemandPaging.html)
    and support was implemented for the ARM-9 family.  A test
    configuration is in place for the NXP LPC3131.  It has been
    verified that this new logic does not interfere with normal
    fixed-page ARM9 operation, but otherwise this new on-demand
    paging feature is untested.
  * Add support for the CodeSourcery toolchain to the Olimex-lpc2378
    port and for the Neuros OSD port.
  * The Neuros OSD port has been updated to work with the production
    v1.0 OSD (previously it only worked with the development board).
  * And some miscellaneous feature enhancements as detailed in the
    ChangeLog.

This includes several important bugfixes:

  * NXP LPC17xx - Fixed a critical bug in the GPIO configuration
    logic: When attempting to set no pull-up or pull-down (floating),
    it would, instead, select pull-down.

  * TI/Luminary LM3Sxxxx - Fixed:
    (1) A logic error in an address table lookup.
    (2) GPIO port encoding the limited support to only 8 GPIO ports.

  * Corrected the lease time in the DHCPC implementation:  It was
    not in host byte order.

  * And several other less important bugs as documented in the
    ChangeLog: Warnings, cornercase compilation problems, etc.

NuttX-5.10
----------

This is the 57th release of NuttX.  This release includes a combination
of some new features as well as several bugfixes.  New features
include:

  * TI/Luminary Stellaris LM3S9B96:
    Header file changes contributed by Tiago Maluta.
  * TI/Luminary Stellaris LM3S8962:
    Header file changes and support for the Stellaris LM3S8962
    Ethernet+CAN Evaluation Board contributed by Larry Arnold.
  * On-Demand Paging Support:
    The basic logic for the On-Demand Paging feature is complete,
    implemented for the NXP LPC3131, and partially tested.  See
    http://www.nuttx.org/NuttXDemandPaging.html.  Some additional
    test infrastructure will be needed in order to complete the
    verification.  See configs/ea3131/README.txt for details.
  * Two Pass Build Support:
    The make system now supports a two pass build where a relocatable,
    partially linked object is created on the first pass and that
    object is linked with the NuttX libraries to produce the final
    executable on the second pass.  This two pass build is currently
    only used to support the On-Demand paging feature:  The first
    pass link forces critical logic into the locked text region;
    the second pass builds the NuttX executable more-or-less as
    normal.
  * CONFIG_APP_DIR:
    Generalized the way in which applications are built and linked
    with NuttX.  The new configuration CONFIG_APP_DIR replaces
    CONFIG_EXAMPLE.  CONFIG_EXAMPLE used to identify the sub-directory
    within the NuttX examples/ directory that held the example
    application to be built.  That made it awkward to configure to
    build an application that resides outside of the NuttX examples/
    directory.  CONFIG_APP_DIR is more general; it can be used to
    refer to any directory containing the application to be built.

    For people who have their own configurations and/or Makefiles,
    you will need to make a couple of changes:

      - Replace all occurrences of CONFIG_EXAMPLE=foobar with
    CONFIG_APP_DIR=examples/foobar in all of the configuration
    files.
      - Replace any occurrences of examples/$(CONFIG_EXAMPLE) with
    $(CONFIG_APP_DIR)
      - Replace any occurrences of lib$(CONFIG_EXAMPLE)$(LIBEXT)
        with libapp$(LIBEXT) in your Makefiles.
      - Check any other occurrences of CONFIG_EXAMPLE.

  * Several bugfixes are included as well as code changes to eliminate
    some warnings.  See the ChangeLog for details.

NuttX-5.11
----------

This is the 58th release of NuttX.  This is a bugfix release.

  * One very important bug fixes a race condition that can occur
    using semaphores that can be awakened by signals.  Under this
    particular race condition, a task could hang waiting for a
    semaphore.
  * Corrections to lm3s8962 port contributed by Larry Arnold.  That
    port is purported to work correctly with these changes in place.

Plus less critical bugfixes as detailed in the ChangeLog.  New features
include:

  * A new configuration to support the mbed.org LPC1768 board.
    (Contributed by Dave Marples.)
  * A driver for the Atmel AT45DB161D 4Mbit SPI FLASH part

NuttX-5.12
----------

This is the 59th release of NuttX.  This is a critical bugfix release.

  * Fixed an important error in the signal trampoline logic.
    Essentially, interrupts are re-enabled while the signal handler
    executes, but the logic to re-disable the interrupts before
    returning from the signal handler trampoline was missing.  Under
    certain circumstances, this can cause stack corruption.  This
    was discovered by David Hewson on an ARM9 platform, but since
    the code has been leveraged, the bug has been propagated from
    ARM to Cortex-M3, AVR32, M16C, SH1, ZNEO, eZ80, Z8, and Z80 --
    almost every architecture. The correction has been incorporated
    for all architectures but only verified on a few.

Other notable changes in NuttX-5.12:

  * A complete port for the AVR32 (AT32UC3B0256) is incorporated
    in the source tree.  Testing of this port is underway now.  This
    release was made before verifying this port in order to get the
    important bugfix in place.

  * Other miscellaneous bugfix and enhancements as noted in the
    ChangeLog.

NuttX-5.13
----------

This is the 60th release of NuttX.  Headlines for this release
include:

  * AVR32, www.mcuzone.com AVR32DEV1

    The port for the www.mcuzone.com AVRDEV1 board based on the
    Atmel AT32UC3B0256 MCU was (almost) fully integrated. The port
    now successfully passes the NuttX OS test (examples/ostest).
    A NuttShell (NSH) configuration is in place (see the NSH User
    Guide at http://www.nuttx.org/NuttShell.html). Testing of that
    NSH configuration, however, has been postponed (because it got
    bumped by the Olimex LPC1766-STK port -- see below)

    Current Status: I think I have a hardware problem with my serial
    port setup. There is a good chance that the NSH port is complete
    and functional, but I am not yet able to demonstrate that. At
    present, I get nothing coming in the serial RXD line (probably
    because the pins are configured wrong or I have the MAX232
    connected wrong).

    A complete port will include drivers for additional AVR32 UC3
    devices -- like SPI and USB --- and will be available in a
    later release, time permitting.

  * LPC1766, Olimex LPC1766-STK

    Support for the Olimex-LPC1766 is newly added to NuttX and is
    still undergoing development, test, and integration. Verified
    configurations for the NuttX OS test and for the NuttShell (NSH,
    see the NSH User Guide at http://www.nuttx.org/NuttShell.html.
    Additional USB configurations are in the release as well, but
    they have not yet been verified.  Goals for NuttX-5.14 include:
    (1) An Ethernet driver, (2) Verified USB support, and (3) SD
    card support.

  * Additional changes and bugfixes as detailed in the ChangeLog.

NuttX-5.14
----------

The 61st release of NuttX, NuttX-5.14, was made on November 27,
2010.  This release includes multiple, important bugfixes as well
as a new driver for the NXP LPC1766.

This release corresponds with SVN release number: r3137

Important bugfixes include:

  * Cortex-M3 Hard Fault.  Fixed a hard fault problem that can occur
    if certain types of interrupts are pending at the time another
    interrupt returns. This problem has only been observed on the
    LPC1766 (returning from a SYSTICK interrupt with a pending
    Ethernet interrupt).  However, it is assumed that all Cortex-M3
    ports could have this as a latent bug.

  * TCP/IP Sequence Number Bug.  Corrected errors some important
    logic in the way that sequence numbers are managed when send()
    sends out packets before a previous packet has been acknowledged.
    Some of that send() logic was incompatible with logic in the
    uIP layer.  Errors seen include: (1) The final final packet in
    a sequence of packets might be too large!  In the THTTPD example,
    this might leave some garbage at the bottom of the display. Or
    (2) send() might hang with outstanding, unacknowledged data
    (and with no re-transmission requests).  This was due to
    differences in sequence number handling in send() and in
    uip_tcpinput.c; uip_tcpinput.c thought (incorrectly) that all
    of the bytes were acknowledged; send.c knew that they were not.

  * One-Shot POSIX Timer Bug. Fixed an error in set-up of a one-shot
    POSIX timer.  It was using the repetitive timer value (which
    is zero in the one-shot case), always resulting in a 10Ms timer!
    Found and fixed by Wilton Tong.

Additional support has been included for the Olimex-LPC1766.  Support
for that board was added to NuttX 5.13.  This release extends that
support with an Ethernet driver.  Verified configurations are now
available for the NuttX OS test, for the NuttShell (NSH, see
http://www.nuttx.org/NuttShell.html), for the NuttX network test,
and for the THTTPD webserver. (Additional USB configurations are
in the release as well, but those have not yet been verified.  Goals
for NuttX-5.15 (and beyond) include: (1) Verified USB support, (2)
SD card support, and (3) LCD support.

NuttX-5.15
----------

The 62nd release of NuttX, NuttX-5.15, was made on December 12,
2010.  This release includes several bugfixes as well as feature
enhancements, primarily for the Olimex LPC1766-STK board.

Important bugfixes included:

  * Additional fixes needed with the TCP sequence number problem
    "fixed" in NuttX-5.14.
  * In the send() logic, now checks if the destination IP address
    is in the ARP table before sending the packet; an ARP request
    will go out instead.  This improves behavior, for example, on
    the first on the first GET request from a browser
  * All USB class drivers need to call DEV_CONNECT() when they are
    ready to be enumerated.  That is, (1) initially when bound to
    the USB driver, and (2) after a USB reset.
  * The SPI_SETBITS macro was calling the SPI setmode method.
  * And several other bug fixes of lower importance (see the
    ChangeLog for details).

And feature enhancements:

  * The LPC176x Ethernet driver was using all of AHB SRAM Bank0 for
    Ethernet packet buffers (16K).  An option was added to limit
    the amount of SRAM used for packet buffering and to re-use any
    extra Bank0 memory for heap.

  * Enabled networking and SD/MMC card support in the Olimex
    LPC1766-STK NuttShell (NSH) configuration.

  * The LPC176x USB driver is now fully fully functional.
  * Added an optional cmddata() method to the SPI interface.  Some
    devices require an additional out-of-band bit to specify if the
    next word sent to the device is a command or data. The cmddata
    method provides selection of command or data.

  * A driver for the Nokia 6100 LCD (with either the Phillips PCF8833
    LCD controller and for the Epson S1D15G10 LCD controller) and
    an NX graphics configuration for the Olimex LPC1766-STK have
    been added.  However, neither the LCD driver nor the NX
    configuration have been verified as of the this release.

NuttX-5.16
----------

The 63rd release of NuttX, Version 5.16, was made on January 10,
2010 and is available for download from the SourceForge website.
This release includes initial support for USB host in NuttX. The
USB host infrastructure is new to NuttX. This initial USB host release
is probably only beta quality; it is expected the some bugs remain
in the logic and that the functionality requires extension.

Below is a summary of the NuttX USB host implementation as extracted
from the NuttX Porting Guide:

  6.3.9 USB Host-Side Drivers
  * include/nuttx/usb/usbhost.h. All structures and APIs needed to
    work with USB host-side drivers are provided in this header
    file.
  * struct usbhost_driver_s. Each USB host controller driver must
    implement an instance of struct usbhost_driver_s. This structure
    is defined in include/nuttx/usb/usbhost.h.  Examples:
    arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_usbhost.c.
  * struct usbhost_class_s. Each USB host class driver must implement
    an instance of struct usbhost_class_s. This structure is also
    defined in include/nuttx/usb/usbhost.h.  Examples:
    drivers/usbhost/usbhost_storage.c
  * USB Host Class Driver Registry. The NuttX USB host infrastructure
    includes a registry. During its initialization, each USB host
    class driver must call the interface, usbhost_registerclass()
    in order add its interface to the registry. Later, when a USB
    device is connected, the USB host controller will look up the
    USB host class driver that is needed to support the connected
    device in this registry.  Examples: drivers/usbhost/usbhost_registry.c,
    drivers/usbhost/usbhost_registerclass.c, and
    drivers/usbhost/usbhost_findclass.c,
  * Detection and Enumeration of Connected Devices. Each USB host
    device controller supports two methods that are used to detect
    and enumeration newly connected devices (and also detect
    disconnected devices):
    + int (*wait)(FAR struct usbhost_driver_s *drvr, bool connected);
      Wait for a device to be connected or disconnected.
    + int (*enumerate)(FAR struct usbhost_driver_s *drvr);
      Enumerate the connected device. As part of this enumeration
      process, the driver will (1) get the device's configuration
      descriptor, (2) extract the class ID info from the configuration
      descriptor, (3) call usbhost_findclass() to find the class
      that supports this device, (4) call the create() method on
      the struct usbhost_registry_s interface to get a class instance,
      and finally (5) call the connect() method of the struct
      usbhost_class_s interface. After that, the class is in charge
      of the sequence of operations.
  * Binding USB Host-Side Drivers. USB host-side controller drivers
    are not normally directly accessed by user code, but are usually
    bound to another, higher level USB host class driver. The class
    driver exports the standard NuttX device interface so that the
    connected USB device can be accessed just as with other, similar,
    on-board devices. For example, the USB host mass storage class
    driver (drivers/usbhost/usbhost_storage.c) will register a
    standard, NuttX block driver interface (like /dev/sda) that can
    be used to mount a file system just as with any other other
    block driver instance. In general, the binding sequence is:

    1. Each USB host class driver includes an initialization entry
       point that is called from the application at initialization
       time.  This driver calls usbhost_registerclass() during this
       initialization in order to makes itself available in the
       event that the device that it supports is connected.  Examples:
       The function usbhost_storageinit() in the file
       drivers/usbhost/usbhost_storage.c
    2. Each application must include a waiter thread thread that
       (1) calls the USB host controller driver's wait() to detect
       the connection of a device, and then (2) call the USB host
       controller driver's enumerate method to bind the registered
       USB host class driver to the USB host controller driver.
       Examples: The function nsh_waiter() in the file
       configs/nucleus2g/src/up_nsh.c and the function nsh_waiter()
       in the file configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/src/up_nsh.c.
    3. As part of its operation during the binding operation, the
       USB host class driver will register an instances of a standard
       NuttX driver under the /dev directory. To repeat the above
       example, the USB host mass storage class driver
       (drivers/usbhost/usbhost_storage.c) will register a standard,
       NuttX block driver interface (like /dev/sda) that can be
       used to mount a file system just as with any other other
       block driver instance.  Examples: See the call to
       register_blockdriver() in the function usbhost_initvolume()
       in the file drivers/usbhost/usbhost_storage.c.

NuttX-5.17
----------

The 64th release of NuttX, Version 5.17, was made on January 19,
2011 and is available for download from the SourceForge website.
This release follows close on the heels of the 5.16 release and
extends the USB host capabilities first introduced in that version.

  * The LPC17xx USB host controller driver was extended to (1) add
    support for low-speed devices, (2) handle multiple concurrent
    transfers on different endpoints (still only one TD per endpoint),
    and (3) handle periodic interrupt endpoint types.

  * Add a USB host HID keyboard class driver.  Now you can connect
    a standard USB keyboard to NuttX and receive keyboard input for
    an application.

And other changes as detailed in the ChangeLog.

NuttX-5.18
----------

The 65th release of NuttX, Version 5.18, was made on February 27,
2011 and is available for download from the SourceForge website.
This is first release from the new NuttX SVN repository.  This
release is made primarily to keep the release tarball in synchronization
with SVN.  Many smaller changes have been made as identified in the
ChangeLog.  Headlines include:

  * Incorporate several important uIP patches -- including the well
    known patch to handle missing SYNACK.
  * The Freescale mc8s12ne64 port is code complete but testing has
    not yet begun due to toolchain issues.  Added support for the
    Future Electronics Group NE64 Badge board.
  * Added support for a new STM32 board, the ISOTEL NetClamps VSN
    V1.2 ready2go sensor network platform.  This board is based on
    a STM32F103RET6 and includes some interesting power saving/clock
    control extensions.
  * USB host support expanded to handle vendor specific USB devices.
  * Incorporated the LUFA HID parser.
  * Various bugfix as detailed in the ChangeLog

NuttX-5.19
----------

The 66th release of NuttX, Version 5.19, was made on March 12, 2011
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  This
release includes several new features in various states of integration
and maturity:

  * 486SX QEMU port.  This port supports the Intel 486SX architecture
    using the QEMU simulator.  Initial functionality is in place a
    partially tested.  There are still some outstanding issues with
    timer interrupts.
  * Platform specific application support.  A new apps/ directory
    appears in this port.  This apps/ directory provides a mechanism
    for applications using NuttX to have a highly customized
    initialization process. It supports a set of end-user applications
    than can be executed (1) standalone so you can have a fully
    customized application startup, or (2) on top of NSH.  Think
    of it this way:  In a buckled-up embedded application, your
    end-user programs will probably have their own dedicated start-up
    logic.  But, during development, you might want to have you
    applications available and executable from the NSH command line.
    This apps/ add-on (and NSH hooks) was contributed by Uros to
    accomplish just that.
  * NSH was also extended to support application specific ROMFS
    /etc/init.d/rcS start-up scripts.  This feature, as well, as
    all of the above-mentioned apps/ directory support was contributed
    by Uros Platise
  * Additional NSH improvements and bug fixes.  See the Changelog
    for details.
  * This release also provides a new SLIP network driver.  This
    driver should support point-to-point network communications to
    a host using TCP/IP or UDP.  This driver is code complete, but
    not tested in this release.
  * New RAMTRON FRAM driver (contributed by Uros Platise)
  * New generic 16550 UART driver.
  * Cortex-M3 Power improvements: Waits for Interrupt (WFI) in idle
    loop for reduced power consumption (LPC17xx and STM32 only -
    contributed by Uros Platise))
  * New waitpid() system interface.
  * Additional bugfixes: pipes, stdint.h, STM32 SDIO and SPI drivers

NuttX-6.0
---------

The 67th release of NuttX, Version 6.0, was made on March 21, 2011
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  The
version number of this release was bumped from 5.19 to 6.0.  A
change in the major revision number is used to reflect an incompatibility
with previous versions.  In this release, the NuttX core OS
functionality has been separated from NuttX application-related
functionality.  These are provided as separate tarballs:

  * nuttx-6.0.tar.gz, and
  * apps-6.0.tar.gz

The purpose of this separation is both to better organize and
modularize the NuttX source tree, but also to provide better support
for incorporation of end-user applications with Nuttx.

The incompatibility results from the changes to the board configuration
logic needed to supported the separable application.  The major
changes to the configuration include:

  * CONFIG_APPS_DIR - This should not be set.  The default is
    ../apps.  This should only be set if you have a custom,
    product-specific application directory in some different location.

  * appconfig - Each board configuration now requires a new file
    called 'appconfig.'  As its name suggests, this file provides
    new configuration information needed by the logic in ../apps.

In addition to this major reorganization in the directory structure,
this release also includes some important extensions to existing
features and some important bugfixes.  These include:

  * The SLIP driver was been well debugged and significantly
    re-designed.  Now you can have an Ethernet connection to you
    board even if you have no Ethernet hardware.  How cool is that?

  * The QEMU i486 port is now functional.  It has also been reported
    to work on the Bifferboard (see http://bifferos.bizhat.com/).

  * And extensions to the uIP driver interface, and

  * Bug fixes to fopen() and STM32 GPIO configuration

Please see the ChangeLog for details.

NuttX-6.1
---------

The 68th release of NuttX, Version 6.1, was made on April 10, 2011
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  The
6.0 release introduced a detach-able application environment to
build applications outside of the NuttX source tree.  The primary
purpose of this release is to correct numerous build problems
introduced by that architectural change:

  * In many newer environments, NuttX produced strange Makefile
    errors but built correctly in older environments.  A fix provided
    by Rafael Noronha was incorporated and is reported to fix those
    build problems.
  * The apps/ directory build system would not handle Windows-native
    toolchains due to obscure path formatting issues.
  * And other problems as detailed in the Changelog.

Many additional changes were made in the 6.1 release for another
major architectural change:  NuttX will now build as a separately
linked microkernel.  In this build option the RTOS builds as a
kernel, applications build separately and interface with kernel via
system calls.  Applications run in user mode and kernel logic users
in kernel-mode.  This provides a secure environment for NuttX.  This
feature is fully coded in NuttX-6.1, but has not been tested due
to higher priority tasks that have arisen.

Related to this change, support for the Cortex-M3 memory protection
unit (MPU) has been integrated with the NuttX kernel build to provide
an even higher level of security.

NOTE: This kernel build is an option; the default build configuration
is still the standard, flat, unsecured RTOS as in previous releases.

Additional new features in this release:

  * Support for LPC17xx GPIO interrupts (with much support from
    Decio Renno).
  * Basic timer support for STM32 (Contributed by Uros Platise)
  * A binfs file system.  This is a tiny pseudo file system that
    lets named applications to be viewed and accessed in NSH under
    the /bin directory.
  * An I2C-based driver for the LIS331DL MEMS motion sensor.
    (Contributed by Uros Platise.)
  * A configuration for the Embedded Artists LPCXpresso LPC1768 board.
  * The user_initialize() interface has been removed.

And several bugfix associated with SD drivers, opendir(), signed
8-bit types (int8_t), and USB serial device.  See the ChangeLog for
details.

NuttX-6.2
---------

The 69th release of NuttX, Version 6.2, was made on May 6, 2011 and
is available for download from the SourceForge website.  The 6.2
release includes several new features:

  * NXFFS: The obvious new feature is NXFFS, the NuttX wear-leveling
    FLASH file system.   This new file system is intended to be
    small for the MCU usage and has some limitations.  No formal
    documentation of NXFFS yet exists.  See the fs/nxffs/README.txt
    file for details (see
    http://svn.code.sf.net/p/nuttx/code/trunk/nuttx/fs/nxffs/README.txt?view=log)
  * Support for NXP LPCXpresso LPC1768 board on the Embedded
    Artists base board.  The Code Red toolchain is supported under
    either Linux or Windows.   Verified configurations include
    dhcpd, nsh, nx, ostest, thttpd, and usbstorage.
  * Support for the Univision UG-9664HSWAG01 OLED with Solomon
    Systech SD1305 LCD controller.
  * A new RAM MTD driver with FLASH simulation capability.
  * A version.h file is now automatically generated so that C code
      can now be version aware.

In addition to these new feature, several important bugfixes are
included in this release correcting problems with dup2(), LPC17xx
GPIO interrupts, LPC17xx UART2/3, the FAT file system, build issues,
and strrch().  See the ChangeLog for more details.

NuttX-6.3
---------

The 70th release of NuttX follows only a nines days after the release
of version 6.2.  It was released on May 15, 2011.  This special
back-to-back release was made so that the current released version
of NuttX will correspond to the initial release from the RGMP
project.

This release adds architecture support and build configuration for
RGMP.  RGMP is a project for running GPOS and RTOS simultaneously
on multi-processor platforms. See
http://rgmp.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page for further
information about RGMP.

This release also includes support for STM32 FLASH, build improvements,
and initial, incomplete support for the MicroChip PIC32MX MCU.  Bug
fixes are included for some build problems, USB host class driver
error handling, NX graphics color mapping, and problems with C

NuttX-6.4
---------

The 71st release of NuttX, Version 6.4, was made on June 6, 2011
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  The
6.4 release includes several new features:

  * A new, full-featured FTP client.  This client may be used as a library
    for automated FTP or via an FTP client shell.  The FTP shell
    supports the following commands: cd, chmod, get, help, idle,
    login, ls, quit, mkdir, noop, put, pwd, rename, rhelp, rm,
    rmdir, size, time, and up.  A configuration is available for
    the NXP LPC17xx to demonstrate this functionality.
  * A functional C1101 wireless driver (contributed by Uros Platise)
  * A PCI-based E1000 Ethernet driver (contributed by Yu Qiang)
  * New C library functions: inet_addr() (contributed by Yu Qiang),
    strndup(), asprintf()
  * Reduced memory allocation overhead for MCUs with small heaps (<64K).
  * fdopen() now works with socket descriptors allowing standard
    buffered C functions to be used for network communications.
  * The NSH ifconfig command can now be used to set or change the
    IP address (contributed by Yu Qiang)

This release also includes some completed but untested functionality.

  * The MicroChip PIC32MX port is now code complete and ready to
    begin testing.  Unfortunately, testing will be delayed due to
    tool issues.
  * Support for the NXP LPC315x MCUs.

Additional miscellaneous enhancements and bug fixes to task_delete(),
recvfrom(), and other changes as noted in the ChangeLog.

NuttX-6.5
---------

The 72nd release of NuttX, Version 6.5, was made on June 21, 2011
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  The
6.5 release is all about support for the Atmel 8-bit AVR family.
I have been interested in the AVR family for some time but because
of the severe SRAM constraints and because of the availability of
many tiny schedulers for the AVR, it has not been "on the radar
screen."  However, I have recently become interested because of
interest expressed by members of the forum and because of the
availability of newer, larger capacity AVR parts (that I don't have
yet).

This release corresponds with SVN release number: r3730

This release includes support for the following AVR boards.  As
with any initial support for new architectures, there are some
incomplete areas and a few caveats that need to be stated.  Here
they are, ordered from the least to the most complete:

  * SoC Robotics Amber Web Server (ATMega128).

    This port of NuttX to the Amber Web Server from SoC Robotics
    (http://www.soc-robotics.com/index.htm).  Is only partially in
    place.  The Amber Web Server is based on an Atmel ATMega128
    (128K FLASH but only 4K of SRAM).

    STATUS: Work on this port has stalled due to toolchain issues.  It
    is complete, but untested.

  * Micropendous 3 AT9USB647

    This port of NuttX to the Opendous Micropendous 3 board. The
    Micropendous3 may be populated with an AT90USB646, 647, 1286,
    or 1287.  See http://code.google.com/p/opendous/. I have only
    the AT90USB647 version for testing.  This version has very
    limited memory resources: 64K of FLASH and 4K of SRAM.

    STATUS: The basic port was released in NuttX-6.5.  This basic
    port consists only of a "Hello, World!!" example that demonstrates
    initialization of the OS, creation of a simple task, and serial
    console output.  The tiny SRAM limits what you can do with the
    AT90USB647 (see issues below).

  * PJRC Teensy++ 2.0 AT9USB1286

    This is a port of NuttX to the PJRC Teensy++ 2.0 board.  This
    board was developed by PJRC (http://pjrc.com/teensy/). The
    Teensy++ 2.0 is based on an Atmel AT90USB1286 MCU with 128K
    of FLASH and 8K of SRAM; a little more room to move than the
    AT90USB647.

    STATUS:  The basic port was released in NuttX-6.5.  This basic
    port consists of a "Hello, World!!" example and also slightly
    simplified NuttShell (NSH) configuration (see the NSH User Guide
    at http://www.nuttx.org/NuttShell.html).

    An SPI driver and a USB device driver exist for the AT90USB as
    well as a USB mass storage configuration.  However, this
    configuration is not fully debugged as of the NuttX-6.5 release.

AVR-specific issues.  The basic AVR port is solid and biggest issue
for using AVR is its tiny SRAM memory and its Harvard architecture.
Because of the Harvard architecture, constant data that resides to
flash is inaccessible using "normal" memory reads and writes (only
SRAM data can be accessed "normally").  Special AVR instructions
are available for accessing data in FLASH, but these have not been
integrated into the normal, general purpose OS.

Most NuttX test applications are console-oriented with lots of
strings used for printf and debug output.  These strings are all
stored in SRAM now due to these data accessing issues and even the
smallest console-oriented applications can quickly fill a 4-8K
memory.  So, in order for the AVR port to be useful, one of two
things would need to be done:

1. Don't use console applications that required lots of strings.
   The basic AVR port is solid and your typical deeply embedded
   application should work fine.

2. Create a special version of printf that knows how to access
   strings that reside in FLASH (or EEPROM).

NuttX-6.6
---------

The 73rd release of NuttX, Version 6.6, was made on July 11, 2011
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  The
6.6 release adds several smaller features but is mostly a bugfix
release.

Bugfixes include

  * Fixed several NX Graphics bugs: Rendering fonts at >8 bits-per-pixel,
    graphics move logic, and display artifacts that appear when a
    window is closed.
  * Corrections to the USB host mass storage class driver
  * STM32 bugfixes: serial driver, GPIO interrupt handling
  * LPC17xx: Changes for a success compilation with no console.
  * Corrections to the Teensy AT90USB SD driver
  * Changes for a clean compilation under the ZDS-II toolchain.

Minor features:

  * Add logic to extract printf strings from FLASH (but there are
    still printf issues for that target)
  * Added a configuration for the Sure Electronics PIC32MX board.
    However, higher priority tasks have stopped work on that
    configuration.
  * Added several new configurations for the STMicro STM3210E-EVAL
    board.
  * Added support for the STM3210E-EVAL board: (1) LCD in either
    landscape or portrait mode, and (2) interrupting buttons.
  * Added a configuration option to use different serial ports for
    debug and for the NSH serial console (there are some issues
    with CR-LF expansion and character echo if NSH is not run on
    the console).
  * Standardized the button press and button interrupt interfaces
    so that they are common across all boards.
  * Added a new graphics example that focuses on placing text on
    the background while pop-up windows occur.  Text should continue
    to update normally with or without the popup windows present.
  * Added ARM stack checking logic.

See the ChangeLog for a detailed description of these changes.

    boards.  Two board ports are available for (1) the Kinetis
    KwikStik-K40 and (2) the Kinetis TWR-K60N512 tower.
  * Support for RGMP 0.3.  This version of RGMP now runs on the
    OMAP4430 (arm) pandaboard
  * LPC17xx CAN driver extended to support both CAN1 and CAN2
    (submitted by Li Zhuoy (Lzzy))
  * Fixed several critical bugs related to signal handling
    initialization and for signals the wake up tasks that are waiting
    to send or receive message queues.Both are important.  (submitted
    by hkwilton).
  * drivers/can.c:  Fixed a semaphore overflow problem in the CAN
    driver (reported by Li Zhouy (Lzzy)).

apps-6.15.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

This release corresponds with SVN release number: r4387

New features and extended functionality:

    * General Drivers:  Add support for (29-bit) extended CAN IDs.  Add an
      infrastructure to support battery drivers.   Add a driver for MAX17040x
      battery "fuel gauge".  Add support for Composite USB drivers (in
      particular for a CDC/ACM with MSC USB composite driver).

      Added a new RAM logging driver.  This will allow debug output into
      a RAM buffer associated with a character driver at /dev/syslog.
      Added the new command 'dmesg' to NSH that can be used to dump the
      current contents of the log.  This is useful for systems that do not
      have the usual serial console (for example, if you only have a
      Telnet console with NSH).

    * Networking:  Add a lower level, primitive socket interface.  Telnet
      driver:

      A New Telnet daemon was created.  It wraps a Telnet session within a
      character driver that can serve as a "controlling terminal."  The
      Telnet session will then be inherited by tasks created from the
      Telnet session and the stdin/stdout from the created task will
      still go through the same Telnet connection.

    * STM32 Drivers.  PWM driver pulse count was limited to 128; now is
      (essentially) unlimited.  Add support for (29-bit) extended CAN IDs.
      Add support for I2C3.  The SDIO driver is (mostly) verified on the
      STM32 F4 platforms.

    * LPC17xx Drivers.  Extended the CAN driver so that the TSEG1 and TSEG2
      bit times can be set via the NuttX configuration.  Add support for
      (29-bit) extended CAN IDs.

    * PIC32 Drivers. The PIC32 Ethernet driver is code complete (but still
      untested).

    * FTPD.  Add a new FTP server daemon.  This is based loosely on
      the hwport_ftpd library provided by Jaehyuk Cho.

    * Library:  Add support for on_exit().  Implemented tcsetattr() and
      tcgetattr().  Moved the old, too-smart fgets() to a new application
      library function called readline().  Dumbed down the original fgets().
      Add strcasestr(), avsprintf(), inet_ntop(), and inet_pton().
      Add support to enable or disable debug output.

    * Build system: Support for building a 32-bit simulation executable on
      a 64-bit Linux machine.  Correct a dependency issue in the arch/*/src/board
      directory.

Bugfixes:

    * System:  Correct PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER

    * FAT: Fix an error in the FAT statfs() reported by David Sidrane.

    * STM32: Fix clock frequencies for APB2 timers.  Correct AFIO register
      offset.

    * PIC32.  Correct GPIOs used for LEDs on the Sure PIC32MX board.

    * NSH.  Wait for a USB connection if a USB serial class is used to
      interface with the host.

Additional bugfixes, name changes, and other differences as detailed in the
ChangeLog.

apps-6.16.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

This release corresponds with SVN release number: r4475

New features and extended functionality:

    * ARMv7M Support:  Includes new, streamlined Cortex-M exception
      handling provided by Mike Smith.  Context switching support for the
      Cortex-M4 FPU registers is now provided (in both "lazy" and "non-lazy"
      modes)

    * General Drivers: Added a generic "upper half" Quadrature Encoder driver.
      The USB CDC/ACM serial driver can now be dynamically connnected or
      disconnected from the host (programmatically or using NSH commands).

    * STM32 Drivers: Added a "lower half" Quadrature Encoder driver.
      Verified the STM32 F4 DMA driver; Added F4 DMA support to the existing
      STM32 SDIO driver.

    * STM32 Board Support.  Added support for the STM32 F2 family and
      for the STM3220G-EVAL board (contributed by Gary Teravskis).
      Support is now included for C++ static constructors (verified using
      the Atollic toolchain). Added support for the SRAM available on the
      STM3240G-EVAL board.

    * PIC32 Drivers.  PIC32MX USB (device) driver is now functional.
      The PIC32MX Ethernet driver not yet fully verified (and an
      unverified SPI driver is also available).

    * Networking.  Added a lower-level, thread-independent socket layer.
      Parts of this layer were created in 6.15 to support the FTPD
      controlling terminal; this support has been extended in order
      to support an NFS file system (not yet released).

    * NuttShell (NSH).  NSH will now support a USB serial connection for
      the console (such as CDC/ACM).  This is useful in environments
      where there is no physical serial port on the board.

    * Build System.  Reorgnaization of networking header files.

Critical Bugfixes.  The following bug fixes are considered critical:

    * Networking:  Fixed a "leak" in the TCP/IP read-ahead buffering logic.
      Corrected an error in TCP/IP sequence numbering/ACK logic which
      occurred when read-ahead buffering memory is exhausted.

    * STM32 Drivers: Fixed an buffer sizing error in the STM32 Ethernet
      driver.

Additional Bugfixes:  Other important bug fixes are listed below. See
the ChangeLog of a complete, detailed list of bug fixes.

    * Networking: Corrected recv()/recvfrom() return value.  Added logic to
      monitor for loss of connection after a new connection has been
      established via accept() (Contributed by Max Nekludov).  Add
      logic to select() to correctly handle POLLHUP (Contributed by Max
      Nekludov)

Additional bugfixes, name changes, and other differences as detailed in the
ChangeLog.

NuttX-6.17
----------

The 84th release of NuttX, Version 6.17, was made on April 14, 2012,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-6.17.tar.gz and
apps-6.17.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

This release corresponds with SVN release number: r4607

New features and extended functionality:

    * Networking:  Additional low-level, thread-independent socket
      interfaces (for NFS client support).

    * RTC:  Added a new interface call clock_synchronize().  This function
      will reload the system time from an RTC and is required when the
      system re-awakens from certain deep-sleep modes.

    * Graphics:  Add NxConsole.  This is a character device driver that
      wraps an NX window and can be re-directed for stdout.  This allows,
      for example, a pop-up graphics window that contains a NuttShell (NSH)
      session.  A test of NxConsole is available at apps/examples/nxconsole.

    * Watchdog Drivers:  Added an interface definition an "upper half"
      driver to support watchdog timers.

    * Calypso:  Support for TI Calypso-based cellphones (as supported by
      the Osmocom-BB project) was contributed by members of the Osmocom-BB
      team.  This includes configurations for the Compal e88 and e99 phones.

    * USB Device Interface:  Needed to extend the USB device interface
      because there was no mechanism for passing endpoint OUT data that
      may need to accompany a setup request.

    * STM32 drivers:  Added some power management controls for entering
      reduced power consumption states.  An OTG FS driver was completed
      and partially verified (this driver seems to be functional but since
      it has been test so lightly, it might better be listed in the
      next section "Work in progress").

    * PIC32 drivers: The PIC32 Ethernet driver is now stable.  The PIC32
      USB device controller driver is now functional (but not yet stable).

    * PIC32 boards: Added support for the Sure DB-DP11212 PIC32 General
      Purpose Demo Board.  There is now a PIC32 Starter Kit that
      provides NSH only through a Telnet connection.

    * Build System:  Some header files were moved into include/nuttx.
      The goal is to move any non-standard header files to include/nuttx
      or include/arch.  Moved include/math.h to include/nuttx/math.h;
      this file is now only instantiated as the 'system' math.h if
      CONFIG_ARCH_MATH_H=y is defined.

    * Tools:  Added tools/cmpconfig.c, a tool for comparing two
      configuration files.

Work in progress.  This release includes some partially completed
work that is still not ready for prime time.

    * NFS Client:  Work is progressing on support for an NFS client
      file system.    This is a port of the BSD NFS client file system
      that is being done by Jose Pablo Rojas V.

    * Automated Configuration:  Automated configuration based on the
      kconfig-frontends tool is being incorporated into the build
      system.  The configuration is still not complete enough for
      general use in this release.

    * STM32 Drivers:  Added files that will (eventually) hold an STM32
      OTG FS host driver.  This is still a work in progress.

Bugfixes:

    * Networking:  Corrected a deadlock that only occurred when
      executing the NSH 'ifconfig' command over Telnet.

    * File system:  Fix incorrect return errno value from read() when
      the file is opened write-only.

    * Graphics:   Fix several compilation errors that have crept into the
      multi-user NX server because of lack of use.

    * STM32:  In order to use CAN2, both CAN1 and CAN2 clocking must be
      enabled. Fixed a troublesome bug in the STM32 F4 I2C driver that
      resulting in timeouts.

    * LPC17xx: Fixes for errors the crept in the LPC17xx DAC logic
      Contributed by Lzyy).

    * Build System:  Reordered the link command line to account for new
      versions of libgcc.a that require symbols from the application
      (abort()).

NuttX-6.18
----------

The 85th release of NuttX, Version 6.18, was made on May 19, 2012,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-6.18.tar.gz and
apps-6.18.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

The majority of changes in this release are focused on supporting the
synchronized release of NxWM, the NuttX tiny window manager.  That
window manager is released as part of the NxWidgets package, but depends
upon many of the changes in this NuttX release.

This release corresponds with SVN release number: r4751

New features and extended functionality:

    * Drivers.  Added a watchdog timer driver infrastructure.  Add general
      support for STMicro STMPE811 I/O Expander/touchscreen device.

    * STM32. Add support for the STM32 IWDG and WWDG watchodog timers.  DMA
      now supports cicular buffer mode; serial driver now uses circular
      DMA to improve Rx performance (Contributed by Mike Smith).

    * STM3240G-EVAL Board.  Add support for the LCD and for the STMPE811
      I/O Expander as a touchscreen controller.

    * PIC32 Boards.  Board support for the Mikroelektronika PIC32MX7
      Multimedia Board (MMB) and for the Sparkfun UBW32 PIC32 board.

    * NX. Framed windows are now draw in three colors instead of just two.
      Numerous other extensions needed to support NxWM (see the ChangeLog
      for details).

    * Library. Add prctl() command that can be used to setting and getting
      the names of threads.  This (plus several other improvements and bug
      fixes) are part of a larger effort to improve task monitoring
      capabilities.

Work in progress.  This release includes some partially completed
work that is still not ready for prime time.

    * NFS Client. Work is progressing on support for an NFS client
      file system.   This is a port of the BSD NFS client file system
      that is being done by Jose Pablo Rojas V.

    * Automated Configuration. Automated configuration based on the
      kconfig-frontends tool is being incorporated into the build
      system.  The configuration is still not complete enough for
      general use in this release.

    * STM32 Drivers. Added files that will (eventually) hold an STM32
      OTG FS host driver.  This is still a work in progress.

Bugfixes (see the change log for details) :

    * sched_setscheduler() return value (Contributed by Richard Cochran).

    * stdio. Ignore CONFIG_STDIO_LINEBUFFER if the file was opened in binary mode.

    * fopen(). Correct an error in parsing open mode string.

    * serial driver. Improved performance be reducing the amount of time
      that Rx interrupts are disabled.

    * recvfrom(). Fix a compilation problem.

    * CDC/ACM device driver. Fix an infinite loop that occurs when the serial
      device is unregistered.

    * STM32 OTG FS device driver. Numerous fixes and the driver is partially
      functional but there are still some issues that become apparent when
      debug output is disabled.

    * fcntl(). Always returned zero on success; however, some fcntl commands
      need to return non-zero values on success.

    * graphics:  Many multi-use mode fixes added to support NxWM (see the
      ChangeLog for details).  Auto-raise is temporarily disabled in multi-
      user mode because it causes some problems with NxWM.

    * on_exit():  Fix compilation errors if CONFIG_SCHED_ONEXIT is enabled.

NuttX-6.19
----------

The 86th release of NuttX, Version 6.19, was made on June 15, 2012,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-6.19.tar.gz and
apps-6.19.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

This release corresponds with SVN release number: r4847

This release features new support for a Network File System (NFS) client.
This feature allows a tiny, embedded MCU to mount a remote file system
exported by an NFS server and then to access the file system as it would
any local file system.  Then the tiny MCU can effectively have terabytes
of storage!

This might be useful for data collection, for MCU configuration information,
for software updates, for providing modular, loadable code modes, controlling
a "farm" of MCUs, ... there are many possibilities and opportunities for
innovation!

The NuttShell (NSH) now supports the following command:

  nfsmount <server-address> <mount-point> <remote-path>

That command will mount the remote NFS server directory <remote-path> at
<mount-point> on the target machine.  <server-address> is the IP address of
the remote server.

The NFS development was the graduation project of Jose Pablo Rojas V. who
is a student at the Instituto Tecnolgico de Costa Rica (ITCR, or TEC).
A lot of effort went into understanding what a tiny, embedded NFS client should
do and getting the target resource usage to a bare minimum.  Only around a
kilobyte or so of memory is required to run the NFS client (and most of that
for I/O buffers).  Jose Pablo has spent several months living with NFS and
should be congratulated.

Additional new features and extended functionality:

    * Drivers:  SSD1289 LCD driver, MIO283QT2 LCD driver

    * LM3S: Additional register definition header files (contributed by Max
      Neklyudov).

    * STM32 Boards:  The STM32F4Discovery will now support an SSD1289 LCD,
      The STM3220G-EVAL board support is now equivalent to the STM3240G-EVAL
      board support.

    * PIC32 Boards: The Mikroelektronika PIC32MX7 MMB board port is now
      functional, very complete, and stable.

    * Graphics:  The NxConsole will now take keyboard input from the NX graphics
      subsystem.  This means that if there are multiple NxConsole windows, only
      the top instance that has focus will receive the keyboard input.

    * apps/:  Add the capability to use an arbitrary USB device as the console
      (not necessarily /dev/console).  Additional enhancements for USB consoles.
      Added the 'mv' command.

Work in progress.  This release includes some partially completed
work that is still not ready for prime time.

    * Automated Configuration. Automated configuration based on the
      kconfig-frontends tool is being incorporated into the build
      system.  The configuration is still not complete enough for
      general use in this release.

    * STM32 Drivers. Added files that will (eventually) hold an STM32
      OTG FS host driver.  This is still a work in progress.

Bugfixes (see the change log for details) :

    * General:  sleep() and usleep() return values, sig_timedwait() errno setting
      on timeout.
    * Drivers: STMPE811 touchscreen driver, USB PLC2303, USB CDC/ACM
    * STM32: Several USB device controller driver fixes, F4 interrupt priorities
      (contributed by Mike Smith).
    * Graphics: Keyboard input, fill trapezoid bug

As well as other, less critical bugs (see the ChangeLog for details)

      STL, RTTI, exceptions -- the complete C++ environment.  (uClibc++ is
      provided as a separate add-on package due to licensing issues).

      Optimized generic and ARM-specific memcpy() function.  Optimized
      memset() function.

      Add support for ferror(), feof(), and clearerror().   Add support for
      __cxa_atexit().

      Math Library:  Port of the math library from Rhombus OS by Nick Johnson
      (Darcy Gong).

    * Applications: New NSH commands:  ifup, ifdown, urlencode, urldecode,
      base64enc, bas64dec, md5 (Darcy Gong).  Add support for NSH telnet login
      (Darcy Gong).  Enancements to NSH ping command to support pinging hosts
      with very long round-trip times.  Extensions to the ifconfig command
      Darcy Gong),

      Many extensions to the webclient/wget and DNS resolver logic from Darcy
      Gong.  JSON, Base64, URL encoding, and MD5 libraries contributed by Darcy
      Gong.

      New examples: ELF loader, JSON, wgetjson, cxxtest, relays.

Bugfixes (see the change log for details).  Some of these are very important
(marked *critical*):

    * Drivers: W25 SPI FLASH

    * STM32 Drivers: ADC reset

    * Graphics: Missing implementation of the blocked method (*critical*,
      Petteri Aimonen).

    * C Library: Floating point numbers in printf and related formatting functions
     (Mike Smith), cf[get|set]speed() (Mike Smith)

As well as other, less critical bugs (see the ChangeLog for details)

NuttX-6.24
----------

The 91st release of NuttX, Version 6.24, was made on December 20, 2012,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-6.24.tar.gz and
apps-6.24.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

This release corresponds with SVN release number: r5447

Note that all SVN information has been stripped from the tarballs.  If you
need the SVN configuration information, you should check out directly from
SVN.  Revision r5447 should equivalent to release 6.24 of NuttX 6.24:

    svn checkout -r5447 svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/nuttx/code/trunk nuttx-code

Or (HTTP):

    svn checkout -r5447 http://svn.code.sf.net/p/nuttx/code/trunk nuttx-code

Additional new features and extended functionality:

  * RTOS:

    - Implemented the POSIX pause() function (still has some compiance
      issues).
    - Tasking logic is extended to support the notion of address
      environments.  An address environment is the key notion underlying
      "process" vs. tasks.  If tasks are created with address environments
      (by binfmt), the OS will propogate that environment to child threads
      and will destroy the address environment when the "process" exists.
    - If support for the PATH variable is enabled, the OS start up logic
      will create an initial environment containing the default PATH
      setting (CONFIG_PATH_INITIAL).  This initial PATH will then be
      inherited by all tasks.

  * Binfmt

    - The NuttX binary loaders have been updated to support the PATH
      environment variable.  Now, if the PATH is properly defined, programs
      can be executed from mass storage using only the file name.  This
      feature is added to support more standard behavior (eventually, NSH
      will support execution of programs in file systems by just entering
      the file name, perhaps in 6.25?).
    - The NXFLAT and ELF binary loaders have been extended to create
      address environments for any new tasks executed from the file system.
      This feature requires that the architecture support a memory management
      unit (MMU) and the address environment interfaces declared in
      include/nuttx/arch.h (currently, this is only supported by the z180).

    * Drivers: LCD driver for the Univision UG-2864AMBAG01 OLED

    * STM32: Support for STM32F100 high density chips contributed by Freddie
      Chopin.

    * STM32 Drivers:  Added optional RS-485 direction bit control (from
      Freddie Chopin).

    * STM32 Boards:

      - Support for generic STM32F100RC board contributed by Freddie Chopin.
      - stm32f4discovery/nxlines: STM32F4Discovery support for the
        UG-2864AMBAG01 OLED.
      - stm32f4discovery/winbuild:  A version of the NuttX OS test
        configured to build natively on Windows.
      - stm32f4discovery/elf: Now uses the PATH variable to find ELF
        executables.
      - configs/cloudctrl: Added for Darcy Gong's CloudController board

    * PIC32 Boards: Update the Mirtool configuration for Release 2 of the
      Mirtoo module.

    * Calypso: Add Calypso keypad driver.  From Denis Cariki.

    * ZiLOG:

      - Add support for the z180 chip family and, specifically, for
        the P112 retro hardware (see http://p112.feedle.net/).
      - All ZiLOG configurations updated to use the current ZDS-II
        and/or SDCC toolchains.

    * Graphics:

      - Add a semaphore handshake so that operations on buffers from
        the NXMU client will be blocked until the NX server operates on the
        buffer data (from Petteri Aimonen).
      - nxtk_subwindowmove() and nxtk_getwindow(): Improvements to clipping
        logic from Petteri Aimonen.

    * C Library: lib/ sub-directory renamed libc/ (there is a new lib/ sub-
      directory that is used to hold all archives).

    * C++: Exception stubs from Petteri Aimonen.

    * Applications:

      - Add NSH hexdump command to dump the contents of a file (or character
        device) to the console (contributed by Petteri Aimonen).
      - Extend the NSH ifconfig command plus various DHCPC improvements
        (from Darcy Gong).

    * apps/examples:

      - ostest: Replace large tables with algorithmic prime number
        generation.  This allows the roundrobin test to run on platforms
        with minimal SRAM (Freddie Chopin).
      - keypadtest:  A new keypad test example contributed by Denis Carikli.
      - elf and nxflat:  If CONFIG_BINFMT_EXEPATH is defined, these examples
        will now use a relative path to the program and expect the binfmt/
        logic to find the absolute path to the program using the PATH
        variable.

    * Build system:

      - New top-level Makefiles: Makefile.unix and Makefile.win (along with
        numerous changes to other make-related files).  This adds basic
        support for building NuttX natively under Windows from a CMD.exe
        window (rather than in a POSIX-like environment). This build: (1)
        Uses all Windows style paths, (2) Uses primarily Windows batch
        commands from cmd.exe, with (3) a few extensions from GNUWin32.

        This capability should still be considered a work in progress
        because: (1) it has not been verfied on all targets and tools,
        and (2) still lacks some of the creature-comforts of the more
        mature environments (like a function configure.sh script and
        'make menuconfig' support).

      - Example Windows native builds for STM32F4Discovery, eZ80, z16f, z8,
        Z80, and Z180.
      - Several configurations have been converted to work the kconfig-
        frontends mconf configuration tool: stm32f4discovery/nxlines, and
        all eZ80, z16f, z8, Z80, and Z180 configurations.
      - Architectures now include a common Toolchain.defs file that can be
        used to manage toolchains in a more configurable way (most of this
        contributed by Mike Smith).

    * Build tools:

      - Renamed tools/winlink.sh to tools/copydir.sh.
      - Several new tools/scripts to support the Windows native build:
        tools/mkdeps.bat, tools/mkdeps.c, tools/link.bat, unlink.bat, and
        copydir.bat.
      - tools/incdir.sh and incdir.bat now support an -s option to generate
        system header file paths.
      - tools/b16.c: Fixed precision math conversion utility.

Bugfixes (see the change log for details).  Some of these are very important
(marked *critical*):

    * RTOS: Fix some backward conditional compilation in the work queue
      logic (Freddie Chopin).

    * File System: Uninitialized variable caused assertions (from Lorenz
      Meier).

    * Drivers: Partial fix for STM32 OTGFS device drivers and fix for short,
      unaligned writes in the flash translation layer (drivers/mtd/ftl.c),
      both from Petteri Aimonen.

    * STM32 Drivers:

      - Qencoder driver and TIM3 driver fixes from Ryan Sundberg.
      - Fix timeout delay calculation in the STM32 OTG FS host driver.

    * LPC17xx Drivers:  Resources not being properly released when I2C
      driver is un-initialized.

    * Graphics:

      - Fix logic when the mouse drags outside of the window; fix
        another "blocked message" handling case (both from Petteri Aimonen).
      - nxtk_filltrapwindow():  Correct an offset problem (also from Peterri
        Aimonen).
      - nxglib_splitline():  Correct the "fat flat line" bug.

    * C Library:

      - nrand() changes to prevent coefficients from becoming zero which
        would "lock up" the random number generate.
      - Add rounding functions to the math library (contributed by Petteri
        Aimonen).

    * Build system:  Changes to MIN definitions in all limit.h header files
      to avoid integer overflows.  For example from (-128) to (-127 - 1)
      (from Petteri Aimonen).

    * Applications: Modbus fixes from Freddie Chopin.

As well as other, less critical bugs (see the ChangeLog for details)

NuttX-6.25
----------

The 92nd release of NuttX, Version 6.25, was made on February 1, 2013,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-6.25.tar.gz and
apps-6.25.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

This release corresponds with SVN release number: r5595

Note that all SVN information has been stripped from the tarballs.  If you
need the SVN configuration information, you should check out directly from
SVN.  Revision r5595 should equivalent to release 6.25 of NuttX:

    svn checkout -r5595 svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/nuttx/code/trunk nuttx-code

Or (HTTP):

    svn checkout -r5595 http://svn.code.sf.net/p/nuttx/code/trunk nuttx-code

Additional new features and extended functionality:

    * OS Initialization

      - Removed support for CONFIG_BUILTIN_APP_START.  This is not really a
        useful feature and creates a violation of the OS layered
        architecture.

    * Task Creation:

      - Implement a simple vfork().  In NuttX-6.25, this interface is
        available only for ARM7/9, ARMv7-M (Cortext-M3/4), and MIPS32
        (PIC32MX) platforms.
      - exec() now sets the priority of the new task to the same priority as
        the parent task (instead of the arbirtrary value of 50).
      - New, partially complient implementations of execv() and execl().
        These are only partially compliant because they do not overlay any
        existing "process space" but rather create the new task and exit().
      - Add a complete implementation of posix_spawn().  This standard
        interface is a better match for an MMU-less architecture than are
        vfork() plus execv() or execl().
      - Add a task start hook that will be called before the task main
        is started.  This can be used, for example, to schedule C++
        static constructors to run automatically in the context of the
        new task.

    * Task Parentage

      - Repartitioned tasking data structures.  All shared resources are now
        collected together in a "task group".  A task group includes the
        original task plus all of the pthreads created by the task.
      - Added support for remember the parent "task group" when a new task is
        started.
      - Added optional support to record the membership of each thread in
        the "task group".
      - Implement support for retaining child task status in the "task group"
        after the child task exists.  This is behavior required by POSIX.
        But in NuttX is only enabled with CONFIG_SCHED_HAVE_PARENT and
        CONFIG_SCHED_CHILD_STATUS
      - Add internal logic to "reparent" a task.  This is useful,
        for example, where the child task is created through a trampoline
        task that redirects I/O.  Reparenting allows the caller of posix_spawn()
        to be reparented for the eventual child thread.
      - Added support for SIGCHLD.  Sent to all members of the parent task
        group when the file member of the child task group exits.
      - If SIGCHLD and retention of child task exist status are enabled, then
        a more spec-compliant version of waitpid() is enabled.
      - New interfaces waitid() and wait() are also enabled when SIGCHLD
        is enabled.

    * File System

      - dup() and dup2() can new be used with opened files in a mounted file
        system.  This supports re-direction of output in NSH to files.
      - The binfs file system was moved from apps/builtin to fs/binfs.  The
        binfs file system was extended to support execution of "builtin
        applications" using exec(), execv(), execl(), or posix_spawn().
      - Added logic based on SIGCHLD to automatically unload and clean-up
        after running a task that was loaded into memory.

    * Binary Formats

      - Much of the logic for "builtin applications" was moved from
        apps/builtin to nuttx/binfmt/libbuiltin.  Includes some extensions
        contributed by Mike Smith.
      - A binary loader was added for builtin applications to support
        execution of "builtin applications" using exec(), execv(),
        execl(), or posix_spawn().

    * Drivers:

      - Added logic to marshal and serialized "out-of-band" keyboard
        commands (such as cursor controls and key release events) intermixed
        with normal ASCII keypress data.  The encoding is partially integrated
        in the HID keyboard driver and the decoding full integrated into the
        apps/examples hidkbd and keypadtest (the latter contributed by Denis
        Carlikli).
      - Driver for the UG-2864HSWEG01 OLED contributed by Darcy Gong.
      - Add support for removable serial devices (like USB serial).  This
        support is enabled by CONFIG_SERIAL_REMOVABLE.

    * ARMv7-M:

      - Added an option to use the BASEPRI register to disable interrupts
        (instead of the PRIMASK).  This eliminates some innocuous hardfaults
        that interfere with some debug tools.  You need to switch to the
        BASEPRI method only if you have such tool interference.

    * STM32 Drivers

      - Bring STM32 F1 DMA capabilities up to par with the STM32 F2/F4
        (contributed by Mike Smith).
      - Add support for USART single wire mode (Contributed by the PX4
        team).
      - Updates to support for SPI DMA on the STM32 F1/F2/F4.  From
        Petteri Aimonen.

    * STM32 Boards:

      - New configuration to support the UG-2864HSWEG01 OLED on the
        STM32F4Discovery board.
      - Added a posix_spawn() test configuration for the STM32F4Discovery.

    * LM3S/LM4F

       - Files and directories repartitioned to support both LM3S and LM4F
         using the STM32 organization as a model.
       - Partial definitions for the LM4F contributed by Jose Pablo Carballo
         (this is still a work in progress).

    * LM3S Boards

       - Added scripts and documentation to use OpenOCD with the LM3S (from
         Jose Pablo Carballo).

    * LPC176x/LPC178x

       - Files and directories repartitioned to support both LPC175x/LPC176x
         and the LPC177x/LPC178x families using the STM32 organization as a
         model.  The LPC1788 port is a work in progress by Rommel Marcelo.

    * LPC176x/LPC178x Boards:

      - Added a configuration to support the Wave Share Open1788 board.
        This is still a work in progress by Rommel Marcelo.

    * LPC2148 Boards:

      - Add basic support for the The0.net ZP213x/4xPA board (with the LPC2148
        and the UG_2864AMBAG01 OLED).
      - Add an nxlines configuration for the ZP213x/4xPA (with the LPC2148
        and the UG_2864AMBAG01).

    * Simulator:

      - Add an nxlines configuration for the simulator.

    * Networking:

      - Add logic to work around delayed ACKs by splitting packets
        (contributed by Yan T.).
      - Split net_poll() to create the internal interface psock_poll().

    * LCDs:

      - Added support for LCD1602 alphanumeric LCD (HD4468OU controller).

    * Graphics:

      - Added 5x8 monospace font. This tiny font is useful for graph
        labels and for small bitmapped display.  Contributed by Petteri
        Aimonen.

    * Build System:

      - Add an options to better manage toolchain prefixes.
      - Redesigned how the context targer works in the apps/ directory.
        The old design caused lots of problems when changing configurations
        because there is no easy way to get the system to rebuild the
        context.  This change should solve most the problems and eliminate
        questions like "Why don't I see my builtin application in NSH?"

    * Kconfig Files:

      - There are several new configurations that use the kconfig-frontends
        tools and several older configurations that have been converted to
        use these tools.  There is still a long way to go before the conversion
        is complete:

        configs/sim/nxwm
        configs/sim/nsh
        configs/stm3220g-eval/nxwm
        configs/stm32f4discovery/posix_spawn
        configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/nsh
        configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/hidkbd
        configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/nettest
        configs/open1788/ostest
        configs/stm32f4discovery/nsh
        configs/stm32f4discovery/usbnsh
        configs/lm326965-ek (all configurations)
        configs/mcu123-214x/nsh
        configs/ubw32/ostest

    * Tools:

      - tools/kconfig.bat:  Kludge to run kconfig-frontends from a DOS shell.
      - tools/configure.c:  configure.c can be used to build a work-alike
        program as a replacement for configure.sh.  This work-alike
        program would be used in environments that do not support Bash
        scripting (such as the Windows native environment).
      - tools/configure.bat: configure.bat is a small Windows batch
        file that can be used as a replacement for configure.sh in a
        Windows native environment.  configure.bat is actually just a
        thin layer that executes configure.exe if it is available. If
        configure.exe is not available, then configure.bat will attempt
        to build it first.

    * Applications:

      - New and modified examples:

        apps/examples/wlan: Remove non-functional example.
        apps/examples/ostest: Added a test of vfork(). Extend signal
          handler test to catch death-of-child signals (SIGCHLD). Add a
          test for waitpid(), waitid(), and wait().
        apps/exampes/posix_spawn: Added a test of posix_spawn().

      - NSH:

        NSH now supports re-direction of I/O to files (but still not from).
        The block driver source argument to the mount command is now
          optional for file systems that do not require a block driver.
        NSH can now execute a program from a file system using posix_spawn().
        Added support for a login script.  The init.d/rcS script will be
          executed once when NSH starts; the .nshrc script will be executed
          for each session:  Once for serial, once for each USB connection,
          once for each Telnet session.

      - Supports a new daemon that can be used to monitor USB trace outpout.
      - Removed non-functional wlan example.

Bugfixes (see the ChangeLog for details).  Some of these are very important:

    * Tasking:

      - Fixed a *critical* task exit bug.  Here is the failure scenario:
        (1) sched_lock() is called increments the lockcount on the current
        TCB (i.e., the one at the head of the ready to run list), (2)
        sched_mergepending is called which may change the task at the head
        of the ready-to-run list, then (3) sched_unlock() is called which
        decrements the lockcount on the wrong TCB.  The failure case that
        I saw was that pre-emption got disabled in the IDLE thread, locking
        up the whole system.

    * Signals:

      - sigtimedwait() would return a bad signal number if the signal was
        already pending when the function was called.

    * Drivers:

      - Some SD cards will appear busy until switched to SPI mode for
        first time.  Having a pull-up resistor on MISO may avoid this
        problem, but this fix from Petteri Aimonen makes it work also
        without pull-up.

    * STM32 Drivers:

      - STM32 FLASH driver counting error (from Freddie Chopin).
      - STM32 F4 maximum SPI frequency was wrong (corrected by Petteri
        Aimonen).

    * STM32 Boards

      - Due to cloning of untested code, the logic to control on-board
        LEDs did not work on any STM32 boards.
      - Serial devices number /dev/ttyS0-5 is there is a serial console,
        but /dev/ttyS1-6 if there is no serial console.

    * Binary Formats

      - C++ static constructors execute now using a start taskhook
        so that they execute in the context of the child task (instead
        of in the context of the parent task).

    * File Systems:

      - Several FAT-related bugs fixed by Petteri Aimonen.

    * Networking:

      - Fix poll/select issure reported by Qiang: poll_interrupt() must call
        net_lostconnection() when a loss of connection is reported.  Otherwise,
        the system will not remember that the connection has been lost and will
        hang waiting on a unconnected socket later.
      - Similar issues corrected for recvfrom() and send().
      - Telnetd would hang in a loop if recv() ever returned a value <= 0.

    * Libraries:

      - fread() could hang on certain error conditions.
      - Can't handle SYSLOG output to a character device from  the IDLE task
        (because the IDLE task can't block).

    * Build System:

      - Serial was driver was not being built if there is no console
        device.  Obviously, the serial driver may be needed even in
        this case.

    * Additional Bugfixes:

      - sig_timedwait() and clock_time2ticks.c: Timing "rounding" logic
      - ARM9 Compilation issue with low vectors.
      - readline() return value
      - Others as detailed in the ChangeLog: HID keyboard, LPC17xx bit
        definitions, strndup(), PL2303, SYSLOG error handling, AT25,
        apps/examples.

NuttX-6.26
----------

The 93rd release of NuttX, Version 6.26, was made on March 15, 2013,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-6.26.tar.gz and
apps-6.26.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

This release corresponds with SVN release number: r5745

Note that all SVN information has been stripped from the tarballs.  If you
need the SVN configuration information, you should check out directly from
SVN.  Revision r5745 should equivalent to release 6.26 of NuttX:

    svn checkout -r5745 svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/nuttx/code/trunk nuttx-code

Or (HTTP):

    svn checkout -r5745 http://svn.code.sf.net/p/nuttx/code/trunk nuttx-code

Additional new features and extended functionality:

    * OS Initialization:

      - Add an additional call-out to support board-specific driver
        initialization during the boot-up phase (available with
        CONFIG_BOARD_INITIALIZE=y).

    * Tasking:

      - New interface task_spawn() that is like posix_spawn(), but uses
        entry point addresses like task_create().
      - Additional data restructuring as a continuation of the task group
        changes of NuttX 6.25.  These data structures were moved from the
        TCB structure into the task group:  pthread join data,
        atexit/on_exit callbacks, waitpid data structures, and message
        queues.
      - TCBs for tasks and pthreads are now separate structures.  This
        saves a little memory since tasks do not have to carry the overhead
        for threads and vice versa.

    * Kernel Build:

      - Extensive changes were made to support the kernel build mode.  In
        this mode, NuttX is built as a monolithic kernel.  NuttX is built
        as a separate kernel mode "blob" and the applications are built
        as a separate user mode "blob".  The kernel runs in kernel mode and
        the applications run in user mode (with the MPU restricting user
        mode accesses).  Access to the kernel from the user blob is only
        via system calls (SVCalls).
      - Extensive changes were made to the syscall, SVCall, and trapping
        logic.  Many internal interfaces were renamed.
      - The memory manager was extended to support both kernel- and user-
        mode allocations.  Logic within the kernel needs to use the
        correct kernel- or user-space allocator, depending upon the user
        of the allocated memory.
      - The user-space blob now contains a header built in at the beginning
        of the block that provides the same information that was previously
        provided by a kludgy, auto-generated header file (user_map.h).
      - Basic support implemented for the ARMv7-M family with fragments
        also implemetned for the ARMv6-M and MIPS32 families.
      - Kernel build supported added for the LPC17xx Open1788 and for
        the Atmel SAM3U-EK board.  All testing is being performed on the
        Open1788 board.

    * Signals:

      - Delivery of signals to threads within a task group is now compatible
        with the way that signals are delivered to threads within a process.

    * Drivers:

      - Add a driver for the SST29VF NOR FLASH parts.
      - USB device trace/debug feature extended to decode device-specific
        trace events to make the trace output more readable (from Petteri
        Aimonen).
      - USB MSC device driver can not support names of differing sizes
        in the USB descriptor and the SCSI fields (from Petteri Aimonen).
      - Locking added to MMC/SD SPI drivers so that MMC/SD can co-exist on
        the same bus as other SPI devices.  Frequency is reset each time
        that the MMC/SD SPI has the bus locked. (from Petteri Aimonen).

    * ARMv6-M (Cortex-M0):

       - Added support for the ARM Cortex-M0 family.

    * nuvoTon NUC120:

       - Added support for the nuvoTon NUC120 MCU (Cortex-M0).

    * nuvoTon NUC120 Boards:

       - Added basic support for the nuvoTon NuTiny-SDK-NUC120 board (Cortex-M0).

    * LPC17xx:

      - Added support for the LPC177x and LPC178x families.  Most of this is
        the work of Rommel Marcelo.

    * LPC17xx Boards:

      - Added support for Zilogic System's ARM development Kit, ZKIT-ARM-1769.
        From Rashid.
      - The port for the WaveShare Open1788 board is now functional.  Basic
        OS test and NuttShell (NSH) configurations are functional. More
        driver development and testing is needed (from Rommel Marcelo).

    * LPC17xx Drivers:

      - Added an SD card MSI driver for the LPC178x.  The driver is marginally
        functional but requires DMA capability to be reliable.

    * STM32

      - Support extended to handle the STM32 F3 family (Cortex-M4 with F1-like
        peripherals).

    * STM32 Boards

      - Added support the STMicro STM32F3Discovery board (STM32 F3).

    * Stellaris LM3S/LM4F

      - Basic support for the LM4F120 family is in place, but untested (mostly
        from Jose Pablo Carballo).

    * Stellaris LM4F Boards

      - Add support for the LM4F120 LaunchPad (untested).

    * Networking:

      - select() should now allocate a little less memory.

    * Memory Management:

      - Extended to support multiple heaps.  This is used as part of
        the kernel build in order to support separater user- and
        kernel-mode heaps.
      - The stand-alone memory manger test had to be removed.  It
        was too entangled and made extension of the memory manager
        nearly impossible.  This is a loss.

    * Build System:

      - Several configurations converted to use the kconfig-frontends
        configuration tool.  There are still many more that need to
        be converted.

    * C Library:

      - Move the workqueue logic into the C library.  There is now a
        special user-space version of the work queue (which will only
        be used with a NuttX kernel build).
      - Implementation of itoa() contributed by Ryan Sundberg.

    * Applications:

      - The NSH builtin task logic now uses task_spawn() to start builtin
        applications.
      - The OS test now includes a test cased to verify task_restart().

Efforts In Progress.  The following are features that are partially
implemented but present in this release.  Most are expected to be fully
available in NuttX 6.27.

    * LM4F120 LaunchPad port.  Code is in place, but nothing has been tested.

    * WaveShare Open1788 port.  This port as actually complete and
      functional. However, there is still ongoing development and
      testing of drivers.

    * Kernel Build.  Much progress has been made, but there kernel build is
      not yet fully functional due to several user resources that are not yet
      properly disentangled from the kernel blob.

    * Conversion of old configurations to use the kconfig-frontends
      tool is an ongoing effort that will continue for some time.

Bugfixes (see the ChangeLog for details).  Some of these are very important:

    * Tasking:

      - The wrong PID was being signalled with SIGCHILD.  It should be
        the PID of the task that create the task group, not the ID of
        the last thread to leave the task group.
      - Added logic so that some internal resources and states are recovered
        when tasks are deleted or restarted.  Handle cases where there are
        outstanding timed events pending when tasks are deleted or restarted.

    * ARMv7-M:

      - Several fixes to the MPU control logic.

    * Drivers:

      - Removable serial drivers race conditions fixed.
      - MAX11802 timing bug (from Petteri Aimonen).

    * STM32 Drivers:

      - Handle cases were SPI DMA logic fails if sem_wait is awakened
        by a signal.  Need to clear error flags to prevent corruption of
        subsequent transfers.  Also, bit count should not be changed while
        the SPI peripheral is enabled (from Petteri Aimonen).
      - Fixes to the OTG FS device driver from Petteri Aimonen.
      - Fix typos in DMA register header file (from Yan T.)

    * Graphics:

      - Correction to the hyphen in the SANS 17x22 font (from Petteri
        Aimonen).

    * Networking:

      - Corrected errors in the socket poll/select logic.  Additional
        state logic was needed to detect if the socket is still connected
        before starting the poll wait. (bug reported by Qiang Yu).

    * Memory Management:

      - mallinfo() should hold the memory manager semaphore (from Petteri
        Aimonen.

    * Build System:

      - Resolved several build errors reported by Mike Smith.

    * Applications:

      - Fixed an NSH memory leak:  Needed to detach after creating each
        pthread.
      - readline() now returns EOF on any failure (instead of a negated
        errno value).  This is because the underlying read is based on
        logic similar to getc.  The value zero  (meaning end-of-file)
        was being confused with a NUL.  So if a NUL was received, the
        NSH session would terminate because it thought it was the end of
        file.

NuttX-6.27
----------

The 94th release of NuttX, Version 6.27, was made on April 28, 2013,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-6.27.tar.gz and
apps-6.27.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

Additional new features and extended functionality:

    * OS Initialization:

      - Add missing registration of /dev/zero.  Registration of /dev/null
        should depend upon conditional compilation.  From Ken Pettit.

    * Tasking:

      - Added a new interface to set aside memory on the task's stack.  This
        is used (at least in the kernel build) to hold task arguments.
      - Remove up_assert_code().  One assertion routine is enough.

    * Kernel Build:

      - Extensive changes were made to support the kernel build mode.  In
        this mode, NuttX is built as a monolithic kernel.  NuttX is built
        as a separate kernel mode "blob" and the applications are built
        as a separate user mode "blob".  The kernel runs in kernel mode and
        the applications run in user mode (with the MPU restricting user
        mode accesses).  Access to the kernel from the user blob is only
        via system calls (SVCalls).
      - Kernel build configurations for the Open1788 board and for the
        STM32F4Discovery now execute correctly.
      - Changes were made to task and thread start-up routines, signal
        handling, data structures, ARMv7-M SVCalls, stack management
        interfaces,

    * Drivers:

      - Driver for the ST7567 LCD Display Module from Univision Technology
        Inc.  Contributed by Manikandan.S
      - SPI initialize functions renamed so that multiple SPI blocks can
        be initialized.
      - Extended to support the RAMTRON FM25V01 device. Contributed by
        Lorenz Meier
      - Serial drivers: TIOCSERGSTRUCT ioctls now conditioned on
        CONFIG_SERIAL_TIOCSERGSTRUCT

    * ARMv7-M (Cortex-M3/4):

      - Added support for modifiable interrupt vectors in RAM

    * nuvoTon NUC1xx:

      - Added kernel build support

    * Freescale Kinetis:

      - Add kernel build support
      - Add support for the Kinetis L family of Cortex-M0+ MCUs.  Contributed
        by Alan Carvalho de Assis.

    * LPC17xx:

      - Now holds off sleep mode in the IDLE loop is DMA is in progress
        (because sleep mode will disable CPU SRAM).

    * LPC17xx Boards:

      - ZKIT-ARM-1769:  Now supports the ST7567 LCD display module.  Added
        an nxhello configuration for testing (Manikandan.S).
      - ZKIT-ARM-1769:  Add support for both CAN1 and CAN2.  Contributed by
        M.Kannan

      - Open1788: Basic support for the WaveShare Open1788 board is complete
        with working OS test, NSH, and graphics configurations.
      - Open1788: Integrated the LPC178x LCD driver with the WaveShare display.
        Touchscreen support is included, howerver, there appears to be an
        issue with the Open1788 touchscreen interrupt signal.
      - Open1788:  Now supports SDRAM (used to provide the LCD framebuffer).
      - Open 1788: Reversed sense of the IDLE LCD. It is now off when the
        LPC17 is sleeping and on when awake.  That is much a better visual
        indication of the dynamic CPU load

    * LPC17xx Drivers:

      - Added an LCD framebuffer driver for the LPC177x/8x family.
      - Implemented LPC17xx GPDMA support.
      - Integrated the LPC17xx GPDMA support into the SD card driver.
      - SSP driver adapted to work with the LPC178x family.
      - Separate LPC176x and LPC178x GPIO logic; this logic is too different
        to maintain in one file with conditional compilation.
      - Re-design of the GPIO logic for the LPC178x family by Rommel Marcelo.

    * LPC43xx:

      - Added kernel build support

    * STM32:

      - Added support for kernel mode build.
      - Added architecure support for the STM32 F427/F437 chips. Contributed
        by Mike Smith

    * STM32 Boards:

      - Added a configuration to support a kernel mode build of the OS test
        on the STM32F4Discovery

    * Stellaris LM3S/LM4F:

      - Added kernel build support
      - Added support for the 7 UARTs on the LM4F120

    * Stellaris LM4F Boards:

      - Added scripts and instructions to simplify use of OpenOCD with ICDI
        (JP Carballo)
      - The basic for the Stellaris LM4F120 Launchpad is complete.  This
        includes support for OS test and NSH configurations.  Additional
        driver development is needed.

    * Build System:

      - Directories where the same sources files are used to build different
        objects in the first and second pass kernel builds need to keep those
        objects in separate directories so that they are not constantly
        rebuilt.

    * Applications:

      - apps/system/ramtest:  Add a simple memory test that can be built
        as an NSH command.

    * Tools:

      - kconfig2html is a new tool which will replace the hand-generated
        documentation of the NuttX configruation variables with auto-
        generated documentation.

Efforts In Progress.  The following are features that are partially
implemented but present in this release.  Most are expected to be fully
available in NuttX 6.28.

    * A port to the Freescale Freedom KL25Z is complete but not yet stable
      enough.  The KL25Z is a low-cost Cortex-M0+ part with 128KB of FLASH
      and 16KB of SRAM.  This is is the effort of Alan Carvalho de Assis.

    * Conversion of old configurations to use the kconfig-frontends
      tool is an ongoing effort that will continue for some time.
      At this time, only 32% of the configurations have been converted
      to use the kconfig-frontends tools.

Bugfixes (see the ChangeLog for details).  Some of these are very important:

    * Tasking:

     - Fixed a critical bug:  When there is pending C buffered output
       and the system is very busy, the a pthread may be blocked at
       a critical point when trying to exit.  Blocking at this critical
       point would cause crashes.  All entire task/thread exit logic
       paths were reviewed and failsafe mechanisms were put in place
       to assure that exitting tasks never block after task teardown
       has been started.

    * ARMv6-M:

      - Fixed parameter passing for all system call inline functions with > 3
        parameters
      - Fixed a major problem:  The Cortex-M0 has no BASEPRI register but the
        logic of NuttX-6.26 was using it to manage interrupts.  Switch to
        using the PRIMASK instead.  This means that hardfaults will (again)
        occur when SVC instructions are executed

    * ARMv7-M:

      - Corrected Correct MPU sub-region settings for unaligned regions.
      - In exception handling with CONFIG_NUTTX_KERNEL, need to explicitly
        set and clear the privilege bit in the CONTROL
      - Fixed parameter passing for all system call inline functions with > 3
        parameters

    * Drivers:

      - Support for O_NONBLOCK was not supported in the "upper half"
        serial driver.
      - PL2303 compilation errors

    * Stellaris LM3S/4F:

      - Corrected typos in alternate function definitions.

    * LPC17xx Drivers:

      - Added a work-around for an ADC errata.  From Chris Taglia
      - Only one ADC pin was configured. Need to configure all that
        are in the ADC0 set.  From MKannan

    * File Systems:

      - The FAT logic was not making a distinction between directory
        non-existence and file non-existence so when it you try to
        create a file in a non-existent directory, it would create a
        file with the name of the missing directory.  Reported by Andrew
        Tridgell
      - Several fixes to the FAT file system from Ronen Vainish.  These
        fixes mostly involve the logic to extend directory clusters for
        the case of long file names but also include a few important
        general fixes (such as for storing 32 bit FAT values)
      - mkfatfs was writing the boot code to the wrong location.  From
        Petteri Aimonen

    * Networking:

      - Fixed a compilation error when socket options are are disabled.
        Reported by Daniel O'Connor

    * C Library:

      - Corrected an error in sscanf.  If %n occurs in the format statement
        after the input data stream has been fully parsed, the %n format
        specifier will not be handled.  Reported by Lorenz Meier
      - strchr(str, '\0') should return a pointer to the end of the string,
        not NULL.  From Petteri Aimonen

    * Build System:

      - Fix naming of NuttX target if EXEEXT is defined.

    * Applications:

      - OS test: Fix timing error in non-cancelable thread test.
      - NSH: Correct the test of the skip input parameter.  Was limiting the
        range to <= count.  From Ken Petit.

NuttX-6.28
----------

The 95th release of NuttX, Version 6.28, was made on June 14, 2013,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-6.28.tar.gz and
apps-6.28.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

Additional new features and extended functionality:

    * File Systems:

      - SMART FLASH file system (contributed by Add Ken Pettit).

    * MTD (FLASH) Drivers:

      - Add support of MTD partitions via a new MTD driver that manages a
        set of MTD devices, each managing a subset of the FLASH region
        managed by the parent MTD driver.
      - Extended the MTD interface to provide an (optional) method to
        perform byte oriented writes if supported by the FLASH part.
      - M25Px driver re-architected to use the byte write capability (when
        possible) and to use 4KB sectors for the erase block size when the
        part supports it (from Ken Pettit).

    * LCD Drivers:

      - New interface definitions to support audio devices (from Ken Pettit)
        and alphanumeric, segment LCDs.

    * Wireless Drivers:

      - Added new driver for the wireless nRF24L01+ transceiver (from
        Laurent Latil).

    * Calypso:

      - Added support for the Pirelli DP-L10 phone (from Craig Comstock via
        Alan Alan Carvalho de Assis)

    * STM32:

      - Added an option to conditionally disable the "wfi" sleep mode.  This
        is needed with certain JTAG debuggers to to prevent the debug
        session from begin disconnected (from Ken Pettit).
      - Added support for the STM32L (STM32L15X/STM32L16x) family.
      - Added STM32F103C4 and F103C8 chip support (from Laurent Latil).
      - Added a new interface function, stm32_dmacapable() that can be used
        to determine if DMA is possible from the specified memory address
        (from Petteri Aimonen)

    * STM32 Drivers:

      - If CONFIG_STM32_DMACAPABLE is defined, the STM32 SPI driver now uses
        stm32_dmacapable() to determine if it is possible to perform DMA
        from the specified address.  This change is important for the STM32
        F4 which may have SPI data buffers allocated on the stack in CCM
        memory which cannot support the DMA (from Petteri Aimonen).

    * STM32 Boards:

      - Support added for the MikroElektronika Mikromedia for STM32F4
        development board (from Ken Pettit) with the MIO283QT2 LCD and
        touchscreen.  Several graphics configurations are included.
      - The HY-mini STM32v board now uses the common SSD1289 driver
        and supported the card detect interrupt.  Several new
        configurations also added and some removed (from Laurent Latil).
      - Support added for the R65105-based LCD that comes with some
        HY-Mini STM32v boards (from Christian Faure).
      - Added basic support for the STM32L-Discovery board.  Drivers
        for the on-board segment LCD are included.
      - Added support for the STM32 Tiny development board based on the
        STM32 F103C8T6 MCU.  This includes support for the nRF24L01+
        wireless on the board (from Laurent Latil).

    * Stellaris LM3S/LM4F:

      - Support added for a TI/Stellaris internal FLASH MTD driver (from Max
        Holtzberg).

    * Stellaris LM4F Boards:

      - The LM3S6965-EK now has configurations for the UDP discovery tool and
        for the TCP echo server (both from Max Holtzberg)

    * Atmel ATSAM3/4:

      - Reorganized, renamed, and updated directory structure to better
        support additional members of the SAM3/4 family.
      - Added support for both the ATSAM4S and ATSAM4L families.  The
        ATSAM4S is similar to the ATSAM3U, but the ATSAM4L is quite a
        different beast, really much more akin to the AVR32s SoCs but
        with a Cortex-M4.

    * Atmel ATSAM3/4 Boards:

      - Added support for the Atmel SAM4L Xplained Pro development board.
        This board features the ATSAM4LC4C MCU (Cortex-M4 with 256KB FLASH +
        32KB SRAM).
      - Added support for the Atmel SAM4S Xplained developement board.  This
        board features the ATSAM4S16C MCU (Cortex-M4 with 1MB FLASH + 128KB
        SRAM).

    * PIC32MX Boards:

      - Added support for the 1602 segment LCD on-board the Sure PIC32MX
        board.  This board will now also support a USB NuttX console and
        the USB monitor test program.

    * Build System:

      - Clean-up of almost all .gitignore files:  Made scope of ignore to be
        only the current directory; Ignore .dSYM files in directories where
        .exe's may be built.  Also, in Makefiles, clean .dSYM files in
        directories where an .exe may be built.
      - Standardize and consolidated all build-as-an-NSH-application
        configuration settings.  Now only CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS is
        sufficient to build an application, test, or or example as an NSH
        builtin application.
      - Added support for a generic ARM, ARMv6-M and ARMv7-M Windows EABI
        toolchains.

    * Libraries:

      - Added encoder/decoder logic to marshal and serialize special segment
        LCD (SLCD) commands intermixed with normal ASCII data.  This is the
        similar to the encoding/decoding logic that is used to marshal
        special commands from a keyboard.
      - Add dprintf() and vdprintf() (the latter from Andrew Tridgell).
      - Add an application that may be built as an NSH builtin command that
        will erase FLASH using a flash_eraseall NSH command (from Ken Pettit).

    * Applications:

      - Added an MTD partition test/examples.  Currently used with (1) the a
        simulation configuration to test MTD partitions on a RAM emulation
        of FLASH and (2) with the Mikroe STM32F4 configuration.
      - Added a test/example to verify alphanumeric, segment LCDs.
      - Added a simple single threaded, poll based  TCP echo server based
        on W. Richard Stevens UNIX Network Programming Book (from Max
        Holtzberg).
      - Added several tests of the SMART block driver and file system (from
        Ken Pettit).
      - Added a runtime configuration for the UDP discover utility (from
        Max Holtzberg).
      - Added an example application to demo the nRF24L01 driver (from
        Laurent Latil).
      - New and modified NSH commands:
        Added a -h option to the df command to show the volume information
        in human readable form (from Ken Petit).
        Add a new mksmartfs command (from Ken Petit).

Efforts In Progress.  The following are features that are partially
implemented but present in this release.  Most are expected to be fully
available in NuttX 6.28.

    * Audio System:

      - A complete audio subsystem include CODECs, higher level management,
        interface definitions, and audio drivers was contributed by Ken
        Pettit.  This work has not been completely verified as of this
        release and so is categorized as a work-in-progress.  At present,
        progress is blocked due to issues interfacing with the VS1053
        audio DAC on the Mikroe STM32F4 board.

    * kconfig-fronted Configuration:

    -  Conversion of old configurations to use the kconfig-frontends
       tool is an ongoing effort that will continue for some time.
       At this time, only 43% of the configurations have been converted
       to use the kconfig-frontends tools.

Bugfixes (see the ChangeLog for details).  Some of these are very important:

    * Tasking:

      - Modify assertion in the priority inheritance logic that is reported
        to cause false alarm assertions.

    * Kernel Build:

      - Typo in syscall proxying logic corrected by Ken Pettit.

    * Networking:

      - Poll setup/teardown logic should ignore invalid (i.e., negative)
        file descriptors (from Max Holtzberg).
      - When readahead data is available, the network poll() logic should
        set POLLIN (or POLLRDNORM), not POLLOUT (from Max Holtzberg).

    * LCD Drivers:

      - Correct power controls in the MIO283QT2 LCD driver.

    * USB Device Controller Drivers:

      - Change the default IN request buffer size from 64 to 96.  This will
        avoid requests of exactly MAXPACKET size and, hence, avoid so many
        NULL packets.  Also, fix the OUT request buffers size to exactly the
        max packet size.  It really cannot be any other size.

    * STM32 Drivers:

      - Correct some bad STM32 F1 DMA definitions that crept into the system
        a few months ago a broke STM32 F1 DMA (from Laurent Latil)
      - Fixed an error in NULL packet handling in the STM32 F1 USB device
        controller driver:  If the NULL-packet needed flag ever got set,
        then it was not being cleared and infinite NULL packets resulted.
        This only affects the CDC/ACM class and was the cause of the
        failures using the USB CDC/ACM device as a NuttX console.  With this
        change the USB works well as an alternative NuttX console device for
        the STM32 F1 family.
      - Correct some bad condition compilation in the RCC logic (CONFIG_
        missing from setting names).  This affects some STM32 FLASH pre-
        fetch settings (from Lorenz Meier).
      - Change for hardware flow control support for STM32. The change also
        fixes incorrect operation of USART2 and UART5 in current master
        (from Lorenz Meier and Mike Smith).
      - Fixed a backward conditional in USB OTG FS host controller driver
        that prevented detection of disconnection events (from Scott).

    * LPC17xx Drivers:

      - I2C interrupt control.  Also correction for a single byte read
        timeout error (from M. Kannan).

    * Freescale Kinetis:

      - Freedom KL25Z pin multiplexing and LED control corrections (from
        Alan Carvalho de Assis)

    * PIC32MX:

     - Fix NULL packet handling in the PIC32 USB device driver.  Without
       this fix the CDC/ACM driver cannot be used reliably with the PIC32
       USB.  With this change the USB works well as an alternative NuttX
       console device.

    * Graphics:

      - Default priorities for NxWidget and NxWM threads should be 100,
        not 50, to be consistent with other default priorities.

    * Applications:

      - Remove the CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NXTEXT_NOGETRUN option from the NXTEXT
        example.  The test logic was bad for the case where this options is
        not selected.  Also, completed the empty Kconfig file.
      - C++ name mangling was occurring when this example is built as an NSH
        built-in application causing the entry to be undefined when called
        from C code.
      - Add some missing NSH library configuration values (from Lorenz
        Meier).

NuttX-6.29
----------

The 96th release of NuttX, Version 6.29, was made on July 31, 2013,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-6.29.tar.gz and
apps-6.29.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

Additional new features and extended functionality:

    * Drivers:

      - Generalized the SSD1306 driver and added support UG-2832HSWEG04
        which is very similar to the existing support for the
        UG-2864HSWEG01.
      - Added support for a generic bit-bang SPI driver.  This includes
        both a common "upper half" driver as well as a platformp-specific
        "lower half" dirvers based on a common "template."

    * ARMv7-A, Cortex-A5

      - Added support for the ARMv7-A architecture and the Cortex-A5 in particular.

    * ARMv7-M, Cortex-M3/4

      - Modified how some registers are copied during a context switch (with
        lazy FPU register saving).  This should save some context switching
        time when the context switch is due to interrupt level processing.

    * STM32:

      - Added support for a separate CCM heap.  This may be useful for
        segregating allocations for CCM (which cannot be used for DMA)
        from other allocations (that may be used used for DMA).

    * STM32 Drivers:

      - DAC: Added support for DAC DMA (contributed by John Wharington).
      - I2C: An I2C driver for the STM32 F3 family (from John Wharington).

    * Atmel AT91 SAM/4:

      - Add support for SAM3X and SAM3A chips

    * Atmel AT91 SAM/4 Drivers:

      - Re-architect the SAM3/4 SPI driver so that is it compatible with the
        SPI drivers of other MCUs.
      - Added register definition file for the SAM4L LCD peripheral.
      - Added SAM4L PDCA register definition file

    * Atmel AT91 SAM/4 Boards:

      - SAM4L-Xplained: Added support for the SPI-based SD card on the I/O1
        module.
      - SAM4L-Xplained: Added a driver for the LED1 segment LCD module.
      - SAM4L-Xplained: Added support for the UG-2832HSWEG04 OLED on the
        SAM4L Xplained Pro's OLED1 module
      - SAM4S-Xplained: Added support for on-board 1MB SRAM
      - Arduino Due:  Basic support for the Arduino Due (SAM3X) is now
        included.
      - SAM3U-EK:  The touchscreen is now functional.

    * Atmel AT91 SAMA5D3

      - Added support for the Atmel AT91SAMA5D3 Cortex-A5 chip family.

    * Atmel AT91 SAMA5D3 Boards

      - Added support for the Atmel SAMA5D3x-EK boards which use the AT9
        SAMA5D3x chips (x=1,3,4,5).

    * Freescale KL25Z Drivers

      - Freescale KL25Z TSI register definitions and example TSI driver for
        the Freedom KL25Z board from Alan Carvalho de Assis.
      - Added SPI driver and register definitions for the Freescale KL25Z.
      - Added a framework for controlling SPI-related discrete inputs and
        outputs.  Taken from work by Alan Carvalho de Assis

    * Build System:

      - New sub-directories to hold SPI-related files:  includes/nuttx/spi.h
        moved to include/nuttx/spi/.; SPI-related Kconfig info moved from
        drivers/Kconfig to drivers/spi/kconfig.
      - Finally... I changed the naming of configuration variables like
        CONFIG_DRAM_ to CONFIG_RAM_.  This has bothered me for a long time
        since most boards don't have DRAM.  The more generic RAM naming
        should not produce so much cognitive dissonance

    * Libraries:

      - Added CRC16 support.

    * Applications:

      - Added Zmodem file transfer support.  This may be used as an embedded
        library or may be built as 'sz' and 'rz' commands that can be
        executed from NSH.
      - C++ initializers should be set once and, preferably, in the context
        of the task that uses any C++ statically initialized classes.  This
        only becomes an issue if cxxtest or helloxx are built as NSH builtin
        applications.  Then you want the initialization done in cxxtext or
        helloxx and not in NSH (and certainly not twice).  Added
        configuration options to control who does the C++ initialization.
        NSH now does not do C++ initialization be default and must be
        configured to do otherwise.  Conversely, cxxtest and helloxx
        will always do C++ initialization unless configured do otherwise.
      - examples/cxxtext:  Add ostream test as provided by Michael.
      - NSH:  Added a 'cmp' command that can be used to compare two files
        for equivalence.  Returns an indication if the files differ.
        Contributed by Andrew Tridgell (via Lorenz Meier).

Efforts In Progress.  The following are features that are partially
implemented but present in this release.  They are not likely to be
completed soon.

    * Audio System:

      - A complete audio subsystem include CODECs, higher level management,
        interface definitions, and audio drivers was contributed by Ken
        Pettit.  This work has not been completely verified as of this
        release and so is categorized as a work-in-progress.  At present,
        progress is blocked due to issues interfacing with the VS1053
        audio DAC on the Mikroe STM32F4 board.

    * kconfig-fronted Configuration:

    -  Conversion of old configurations to use the kconfig-frontends
       tool is an ongoing effort that will continue for some time.
       At this time, only 45% of the configurations have been converted
       to use the kconfig-frontends tools.

Bugfixes (see the ChangeLog for details).  Some of these are very important:

    * File Systems:

      - Fixed compilation error if no file systems are enabled: Change
        error to ERROR.
      - Read-Ahead/Write buffering: Correct typos that can cause failures
        in some configurations (From Chia Cheng Tsao).

    * Drivers

      - Remove the wait for the touchscreen busy bit in the ADS7843E driver.
        From my reading of the ADS7843 spec, it would not be appropriate to
        wait for the BUSY bit to de-asserted anyway (since it is only de-
        asserted when we read the data).  Most boards do not even bother to
        provide the BUSY bit.
      - MMC/SD SPI based driver:  Driver needs to make sure that the SPI
        mode and data width are correct.
      - ENC28J60:  Change buffer ordering to work around Errata.  From Dave
        (ziggurat29).

    * USB Device Controller Drivers:

      - Fixed a typo in the composite device driver unitialization logic.
        DEV1 should be DEV2 in one case.
      - usbdev.h: Fix some typos that cause compiler errors when
        CONFIG_USBDEV_DMA and CONFIG_USBDEV_DMAMEMORY are selected (From
        Chia Cheng Tsao).

    * ARM9:

      - Fix a bug (uninitialized register error) that crept in the ARM9
        boot-up code several years ago.  Obviously no one has used the
        ARM9 NuttX port for years!

    * STM32 Drivers:

      - Fix STM32 OTF FS endpoint allocation logic.  Apparently the same
        endpoint can be allocated as both an IN or an OUT endpoint.  The
        existing implementation only supported one allocation, either IN or
        OUT.  This resulted in failures to allocate endpoints when used with
        the CDC/ACM + MSC composite driver (From Chia Cheng Tsao).
      - SDIO: Add support for the data block end (DBCKEND) interrupt to
        terminate transfers (From Chia Cheng Tsao).
      - DAC: Fixed numerous DAC driver errors and added support for DAC
        DMA (contributed by John Wharington).

    * SAM3/4:

      - SAM4S: Correct configuration of PIO pins for SAM4S B and C peripherals.
      - Need to disable write protection before configuring PIO pins.
      - GPIO configuration logic must protect against re-entrancy.
      - Clocking must be applied to the SMC module for the 3X and 3A family in
        order for the NFC SRAM to be functional.
      - Fixed some errors for interrupts on ports D-F.

    * SAM3/4 Drivers:

      - Common SPI driver: Fix SPI mode setting.  In the SAM3/4 family, the
        clock phase control (CPHA) is inverted (NPHA).  Also fixed an
        incorrect pointer test.  Was checking if the wrong pointer was NULL.

    * SAM3/4 Boards:

      - SAM3U-EK: Fix polarity of the /PENIRQ signal (it is active low).
        The SAM3U-EK board now runs at 96MHz.

    * Applications:

      - apps/examples/nxhello:  Minor fix for compilation error when the
        display resolution is low (< 8bpp) due to a typo that has been there
        for a long time.  Also Correct default colors when in Y1 code mode.
      - apps/system/ramtest:  The RAM test was not correctly built
        into the configuration and build system.
      - apps/examples/composite: Change to prevent some false alarm debug
        assertions (From Chia Cheng Tao).

NuttX-6.30
----------

The 97th release of NuttX, Version 6.30, was made on September 14, 2013,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-6.30.tar.gz and
apps-6.30.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

Additional new features and extended functionality:

        common USB host logic to handle host controllers with multiple
        downstream ports in the root hub.
      - USB device tracing: Extended decoding and stringifying of USB trace
        output to include trace output from class drivers.
      - USB host tracing:  Added support for USB host tracing similar in
        some ways to USB device tracing:  Stringification is an inherent
        part of the trace decoding (not an option).  Only available in the
        SAMA5 USB host drivers now.

    * Networking / Network Drivers

      - Support for the Microchip ENCX24J600 Ethernet driver from Max
        Holtzberg

        STM32 P107 board.
      - LeafLabs Maple Board:  Add board support for the LeafLabs Maple and
        Maple Mini boards.  From Librae.

    * Atmel AT91 SAMA5D3x

      - Support for PIO interrupts
      - Utilities for intelligent conversions between physical and virtual
        addresses.
      - Added USB host controller drivers for both the OHCI (low- and full-
        speed) peripheral and the ECHI (high-speed) peripheral.
      - Added USB device controller for the SAMA5 UDPHS peripheral (full-
        and high-speed).
      - Added a Two Wire (TWI) driver.  This is a variant of I2C.

    * Atmel AT91 SAMA5D3x-EK Development Boards

      - Now supports onboard SDRAM.  Modified heap initialization logic
        to include SDRAM if configured.
      - Integrated a FAT file system on the on-board SPI-based AT25 serial
        FLASH
      - Integrated HSMCI0 and HSMCI1 support for the microSD and full file
        SD card slots.  Includes PIO interrupts for card detection events.
      - Integrated USB OHCI and ECHI host and high-speed peripheral support.
        File system on AT25 now exported via Mass Storage Class.  Includes
        PIO VBUS controls.
      - Integrated the TWI driver and the I2C tool.  Added support for an
        external AT24 serial EEPROM.

    * Applications:

      - apps/examples/cc3000.  Initial support for the TI CC3000 network
        module on the Freescale Freedom-KL25Z board from Alan Carvalho de
        Assis. Includes the test to verify the CC3000.
      - apps/examples/usbmsc:  apps/examples/usbstorage renamed usbmsc for
        consistency. Change submitted by CCTSAO.
      - apps/system/usbmonitor:  The USB monitor has been extended so that
        it can be used with USB device or host trace data.

Efforts In Progress.  The following are features that are partially
implemented but present in this release.  They are not likely to be
completed soon.

    * CC3000 Networking

      - CC3000 Networking.  Initial support for the TI CC3000 network
        module on the Freescale Freedom-KL25Z board from Alan Carvalho
        de Assis.  This is still a work in progress.

    * kconfig-fronted Configuration:

      - Conversion of old configurations to use the kconfig-frontends
        tool is an ongoing effort that will continue for some time.
        At this time, only 46% of the configurations have been converted
        to use the kconfig-frontends tools.

Bugfixes (see the ChangeLog for details).  Some of these are very important:

    * File Systems:

      - ROMFS: Fix an error where long (>15) file names were read
        incorrectly from a ROMFS file system.  From Mike Smith
      - NXFFS: Clean up some compiler warnings.

    * Common Drivers

      - MMC/SD driver: Correction for a bad return value when multiple
        block SDIO transfers are suppressed.  By Andrew Tridgell.
      - USB HID keyboard and mass storage host-side class drivers:  Fix some
        compilation errors and warnings when pre-allocated data structures
        are used.
      - USB device-side class drivers:  Fix some compilations errors when
        DUALSPEED (i.e., full- and high-sped) support is enabled.
      - CDC/ACM and PL2303: Don't use max packetsize assigned to the endpoint
        when allocating request buffers; The default value of the endpoint
        max packetsize may be incorrect because the endpoint has not yet
        been configured.  Really only an issue for high-speed endpoints.
      - USB Host Mast Storage Class:  Fixed a problem that was causing some
        devices to fail to initialize: If device is returning fatal transfer
        errors while attempting to initialize, don't bother with the startup
        retries; abort immediately so that the device will be reset and we
        can try again with a better ready device.
      - USB Host Mast Storage Class:  Correct a reference counting error:
        When an MSC device transfer fails while waiting for UnitTestReady,
        the reference count on the class was not being decremented.  The end
        result is a memory leak as can be seen by the USB device numbers
        incrementing: sda, sdb, sdc, ...
      - USB Device CDC/ACM:  Fix backward conditional compilation in the
        CDC/ACM driver with regard to remote wakeup and self-powered
        capabilities.  From the PX4 team via Lorenz Meier,

    * Networking / Network Drivers

      - ARP IP harvesting:  Correct backward condition in netmask task.
        From Max Holtzberg.
      - Network connection monitor: Fixes a race condition where a loss of
        connection may not be detected when the connection is lost before it
        has been accepted (from Max Holtzberg).
      - TCP/IP Backlog:  Fix a critical bug in the TCP/IP backlog
        initialization:  Only the first backlog buffer was getting added to
        the free list.  From Max Holtzberg.
      - ENC28J60:  Fixes and improvements back-ported from the ENCX24J600
        to the ENC28J60 by Max Holtzberg.

    * STM32 Drivers:

      - STM32 I2C fixes for the STM32 F3 family from John Wharington.
      - STM32 I2C Correct an error that crept into the STM32 F1 I2C
        driver with some recent changes.  From Librae
      - STM32 F4: Added some missing CONFIG_SERIAL_TERMIOS support; Fixed
        some STM32 F4 Timer 8 pin configurations.  From CCTSAO.
      - STM32 SDIO: If CONFIG_SDIO_BLOCKSETUP defined, OS would crash.  Now
        Generate an error if CONFIG_SDIO_BLOCKSETUP is defined; that
        option is not yet supported by the STM32 SDIO driver.  From CCTSAO
      - STM32 I2C Timers: Some CCER bit settings changed. Submitted by
        CCCTSAO.
      - STM32 CAN: Fix access to CAN filter registers.  From the PX4 team
        via Lorenz Meier.
      - STM32 Kconfig: Fix STM32 UART7/8 Kconfig names and UART DMA.  From
        the PX4 team via Lorenz Meier.

    * LPC17xx Drivers

      - Fix #endif with missing #if in USB host header file.  Reported
        by Andrew Bradford,

    * SAM3/4 Boards:

      - Corrected DMA-related problems: Bad register definitions, parameters
        reversed in a function call.
      - Correct a race condition in the HSMCI driver when an interrupt
        occurs before the wait for the interrupt begins.
      - Peripheral clock setup:  Correct a typo in a register name.

    * Atmel AT91 SAMA5D3

      - Order of some operations changed in boot-up logic to defer
        enabling of caching of memory regions until SDRAM is initialized.
      - Correct handling of spurious interrupts.

    * Freescale KL25Z Drivers

      - KL25Z SPI: Correct typo in name of a function.  From Alan Carvalho
        de Assis.

    * Applications:

      - apps/examples/composite:  Fix a typo that can cause a configuration
        error.  From CCTSAO.
      - apps/examples/pwm:  Clean-up some configuration confusion.
      - apps/netutils/dhcpd/dhcpd.c:  Fixed calculation of the next lease
        address.  From Paolo Messina.
      - apps/examples/usbmsc:  Don't try to control USB trace if we are
        an NSH built-in task.  In that case our attempts are inadequate
        and only interfere with with other logic that is attempting to
        to do the same thing (in NSH or in the USB monitor).
      - apps/examples/usbmsc:  IMPORTANT bug fix: Change how the msconn
        works.  Because of recent changes the msconn command was hanging.
        This was because the USB MSC start-up logic creates a pthread;
        Now waitpid() will wait until all members of the task group
        exit.  So NSH was hanging in waitpid when msconn started even
        though msconn returned.  The USB MSC logic really should not use
        a pthread, but we are stuck with that for now.  The work-around
        is the msconn now daemonizes itself so that it so that the pthread
        is created in a different task group.
      - apps/nshlib:  Fix NSH listing output for the case of a single file.

NuttX-6.31
----------

The 98th release of NuttX, Version 6.31, was made on October 28, 2013,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-6.31.tar.gz and
apps-6.31.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

Additional new features and extended functionality:

    * General:

      - Standardized stack checking logic so the interfaces can be used
        by common stack monitoring logic.

    * Audio Subsystem and Audio Drivers:

      - Ken Pettit has finally released his long awaited audio subsystem.
        This is a generic audio subsystem that is appropriate for the
        deeply embedded MCU.  Current testing has, however, been focused
        on the VS1053 CODEC chip.
      - Ken Pettit's VS1053 audio CODEC driver is now functional.

    * Networking / Network Drivers

      - Add the prefix ETH0 to all PHY configuration selections.  This
        will allow us to support to Ethernet MAC drivers with two different
        PHYs (identified with ETH0 and ETH1).  Enabled with CONFIG_NETDEV_MULTINIC.
      - Add MII/RMII PHY definitions for the Micrel KSZ8051 PHY.
      - Add GMII/GRMII PHY definitions for the Micrel KSZ9021/31 PHY.
      - New network-optimized, higher-performance sendfile() implementation
        from Max Holtzberg.
      - Added a simple routing table.  This table is currenly only used (1)
        when we need to look-up an Ethernet device based on an IP address,
        and (2) in the ARP logic when we need to request the MAC address of
        the router, vs the MAC address of the peer.
      - Make net_close() nonblocking and free unestablished connections if
        no free connections available.  From Max Holtzberg.
      - Changed the meaning of the uip_*input functions. They now return
        success when a packet is dropped; This is needed for the ENCX24J600
        driver that must make a decision to return the packet or not:  It
        should not retry dropped packets. From Max Holtzberg.
      - David Sidrane has completed integration of the CC3000 networking.
        This is much more than a network driver:  It is a complete
        replacement for the NuttX networking with off-chip networking support
        in the CC3000.
      - Numerous enhancements to the ENCX24J600 driver from Max Holtberg.

    * Other Common Drivers:

      - The SST25 serial FLASH MTD driver now includes support for the
        SST25VF016B.  From David Sidrane.
      - Add a preflight method to the SDIO interface to support the STM32
        DMA usage model. From Mike Smith.
      - Enhanced the MMC/SD SDIO driver to perform DMA preflight operations
        and fail DMA read/write requests that fail preflighting. From Mike
        Smith.
      - Add an ioctl command that can be used to trigger ADC/DAC conversion
        under application control.

    * File Systems:

      - Enhanced the FAT32 filesystem code to understand DMA preflight
        failures, and to use the file sector buffer as a bounce buffer when
        a user-supplied buffer is not suitable for DMA. From Mike Smith.

    * Atmel AT91 SAMA5D3x

      - Add support so that subsets of the total DRAM (and other external
        memory) can be added to the heap, leaving other memory reserved for
        other purposes (like the LCDC framebuffers).

    * Atmel AT91 SAMA5D3x Drivers:

      - Use more descriptive task names when starting the EHCI and OHCI
        monitor tasks.
      - Added a 10/100Base-T Ethernet (EMAC) driver.
      - Added a 1000Base-T Ethernet (GMAC) driver.
      - Added a Real Time Clock (RTC) driver and integrated with the NuttX
        system time logic.
      - Added support for /dev/random using the SAMA5D3x True Random Number
        Generator (TRNG).
      - Added a Watchdog Timer (WDT) driver.
      - Added a Timer/Counter (TC) library with interface that make be used
        by other drivers that need timer support.
      - Added an ADC driver that can collect multiple samples using the
        sequencer, can be trigger by a timer/counter, and supports DMA data
        transfers.
      - Added a touchscreen driver based on the special features of the
        SAMA5D3 ADC peripheral.
      - Added an LCD controller (LCDC) frame buffer driver.
      - Added a CAN driver.  However, testing has been delayed because of
        cabling issues.
      - Basic header file support is available for the Image Sensor
        Interface (ISI) camera interface.  Work on the camera driver is
        underway and is expected in the next release.

    * Atmel AT91 SAMA5D3x-EK Development Boards

      - Add OS test support for the FPU test.
      - Enable the task name feature board configuration sto provide
        prettier ps command output.
      - Added NX and NxWM configurations to verify the LCD and touchscreen.
        There are still some outstanding issues with the NxWM configuration
        as of this release.
      - The TRNG and /dev/random are now enabled by default in the demo
        configuration.

    * Atmel AT91 SAM3/4 Boards:

      - Add configuration to select revision 3 of the Arduino Due which has
        some small but important differences.  Suggested by gdi@embedders.org.

    * STMicro STM32:

      - Add support for the STM32F207ZE chip. From Martin Lederhilger.

    * STMicro STM32 Boards:

      - Add configuration for the Spark Core.  The initial check-in is
        basically the Maple Mini board and subsequent development by David
        Sidrane is his special Spark emulation hardware.  The configuration
        should be very mature when actual Spark hardware is available.
      - Support for the Olimex STM32 P207 board added by Martin Lederhilger.
      - Configuration for the Mikroe STM32F4 board configuration updated for
        audio support by Ken Pettit.

    * NXP LPC17xx Boards:

      - zkit-arm-1769:  LED1 is now user controllable after booting. From
        Rashid Fatah.

    * Kinetis KL Drivers:

      - PIT and TPM register definitions header files for the from Alan
        Carvalho de Assis.
      - Added low-level getc() function for operation with no file system.
        The KL25Z can now support NSH in a very minimal system that does
        not even have a file system.

    * Kinetis KL Boards

      - A new configuration called minnsh was added is an experiement to
        see how small we can get the NuttX footprint and still support NSH.
        From Alan Carvalho de Assis..

    * TI Calypso Phones:

      - Basic board support for the Motorola C139 (Compal E86) phone.  From
        Craig Comstock.

    * Applications:

      - Moved several useful examples from apps/examples to apps/system.
        This includes USB MSC, USB CDC/ACM, and USB Composite.
      - New addroute and delroute commands added to NSH in order to manage
        the network routing table.
      - Numerous enhancements and updates to the CC3000 example from David
        Sidrane.
      - Add a new stack monitor daemon that can be used to constantly
        monitor stack usage by all threads.
      - Numerous changes to get NSH working with no file system.  Basically
        this suppresses I/O redirection and replaces file I/O with calls to
        low-level console read/write functions.  Suggested by Alan Carvalho
        de Assis.
      - apps/system/nxplayer: A new, command-line media player called
        'nxplayer' from Ken Pettit.
      - apps/examples/random:  Add a simple test that dumps values from
        /dev/random.
      - apps/examples/adc:  Add support so that a ADC driven by software
        triggering can be tested.

    * Build System:

      - The MKDEP tools now support a new argument that identifies the
        object file path.

Efforts In Progress.  The following are features that are partially
implemented but present in this release.  They are not likely to be
completed soon.

    * kconfig-fronted Configuration:

      - Conversion of old configurations to use the kconfig-frontends
        tool is an ongoing effort that will continue for some time.
        At this time, only 48% of the configurations have been converted
        to use the kconfig-frontends tools.

Bugfixes (see the ChangeLog for details).  Some of these are very important:

    * Initialzation and Scheduling:

      - IDLE thread initialization logic should not call group_setupidlefiles()
        if there are no file descriptors (and, hence, no file system).
      - Fix some cornercase error handling logic:  If sched_releasetcb() is
        called as part of a failed pthread startup before the flags field in
        the TCB has been initialized, then a crash occurs. Pointed out by
        David Sidrane.

    * Networking / Network Drivers:

      - Look up of a device using subnet will fail if the packet is being
        sent out of our subnet (via a router). The fallback here is just to
        use the only device ("eth0") if the subnet lookup fails (this logic
        was extended to handle multiple Ethernet devices by adding a simple
        routing table).
      - Fix some backward conditional logic in send() that enabled the
        check if the ARP address is in the ARP table.  From Max Holtzberg.
      - Notify the socket layer from the network monitor if a connection is
        lost before the monitoring callback has been registered.  From Max
        Holtzberg.
      - send():  Reset the send timeout when the data is ACKed, not when the
        data is sent.  Remove conditions on checking for timeout.  From Max
        Holtzberg.
      - Correct how the TCP/IP initial minimum MSS is calculated. Max
        Holtzberg.
      - TCP state machine: Move tcp connection into SYN_RCVD state after
        aception instead of bypassing and moving directly into ESTABLISHED.
        From Max Holtzberg.
      - Numerous fixes to the ENCX24J600 driver from Max Holtberg.

    * USB Drivers:

      - Change naming of SELFPOWERED and REMOTEWAKEUP to avoid name
        collisions.  Prepend the name of the driver (for example
        CDCACM_SELFPOWERED).
      - CDC/ACM class driver:  Change the interval for the interrupt
        endpoint from 0xff (invalid) to 10.  This is not a critical
        change but will avoid a complaint from the Linux driver when
        it overrides the 0xff value.

    * ARM Cortex-A5:

      - Fix an error in data cache clean and invalidate functions: Fix of
        addresses to cache line boundaries.

    * Atmel AT91 SAMA5D3x Drivers:

      - Correct some inconsistencies in the way that USB configuration
        settings are used.  This caused compilation errors in SAMA5 OHCI
        when USB debug was ON but USB host tracing was off.
      - When 480MHz UPLL is used to drive OHCI, it should have a divider
        of 10.  However, that does not work.  A divider of 5 does.  Why?.
      - OHCI HCD: Fix a place where DMA-related data needed to be flushed
        to data cache; Fix another where a virtual address was being used
        in a register where a physical address was required.
      - HSMCI Driver: TX DMA disabled.  It is just not reliable. No idea
        why.  RX DMA is still used.
      - STM32F103C pinmapping corrections from David Sidrane.

    * Atmel SAMA5D3x-EK Board

      - Increase the number of pre-allocated watchdog timers.  The default
        number of 4 was easily being exhausted in the more complex
        configurations.

    * STMicro STM32:

      - STM32 F4 DMA definitions: Typo fixes for UART7 and UART8 DMA
        configs.  From Mike Smith.
      - DMA priority configuration corrections from Mike Smith.
      - Changes to the stm32_dmacapable API. In order to correctly
        verify that a buffer can be transferred, the transfer count and
        the CCR value are required.  Implemented stm32_dmacapable for
        stm32f1xx devices. Enhanced stm32_dmacapable for stm32f2xx and
        stm32f4xx devices to check for additional conditions that will cause
        DMA to fail or lose data.
      - STM32 F1 DMA fix from David Sidrane: The DMA_CNDTRx register
        cannot be modified if the DMA channel is disabled.

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - Fix compilation errors from bad bit definitions in ADC and PWM
        register.  From Martin Lederhilger.
      - DMA-related fixes to the SPI driver from Ken Pettit.

    * NXP LPC17xx Drivers:

      - Remove undefined spi_select() prototype.  This was causing compile
        time warnings.

    * NXP LPC17xx Boards:

      - zkit-arm-1768:  MMC/SD is on SPI, not SSP0.  From Rashid Fatah.

    * C Library

      - scanf() fixes from kfrolov: 1) sscanf() function hangs in the
        following example: sscanf("2", "%u,%u,%u,%u", ...), 2) sscanf()
        returns incorrect number of parsed numbers if some arguments
        can't be parsed: sscanf("=2", "%u,%u,%u,%u",...)==1 instead of
        0, and 3) using of char* instead of const char* in vsscanf
        function leads to warnings from GCC.

    * Build System

      - Dependency generation generation was broken for directories that
        keep objects in a sub-directory.  The MKDEP tools now support a new
        argument that identifies the object file path.
      - tools/define.sh:  'cut' no longer works as it once did.  Script
        adapted to observed behavior.

    * Applications:

      - Remove a warning from the NSH library when DHCP is not enabled.
      - Default NSH IP address should be 0x0a000001 (10.0.0.1), not
        0xa0000001 (160.0.0.1).  Ditto for the gateway.
      - Add some missing options to the OS test Kconfig file
      - Fix some bad conditional compilation in the USB monitor.
      - Fix default I2C frequency used by the I2C tool:  400KHz instead
        of 4MHz.  Suggested by Max Kriegleder.
      - Increase stack size for the system/info command. Ken Petit
        reports that this simple command can exceed its 768 stack size
        under certain conditions.  The size is marginal and has been
        increased to 1024 by default but is also now configurable.
      - apps/Makefile:  Needs to include external/Make.defs if we want
        allow external applications to participate in the NuttX
        configuration.  Suggested by gdi@embedders.org.
      - apps/netutils/telnetd:  Missing argument to debug statement
        can cause crashes in certain error conditions. From David
        Sidrane.
      - apps/examples/can:  Correct an error in a debug statement.  From
        Martin Lederhilger.

NuttX-6.32
----------

The 99th release of NuttX, Version 6.32, was made on December 7, 2013,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-6.32.tar.gz and
apps-6.32.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

Additional new features and extended functionality:

    * General:

      - Extension and standardization of stack debug logic.  Now includes
        coloration of the IDLE and interrupt stacks as well as the heap.
        Suggested by David Sidrane.

    * Audio Subsystem and Audio Drivers:

      - I2S interface definition.  Integrates with audio sub-system.
      - VS1053 worker thread stack size is now configurable and assigned a
        name via pthread_setname_np(). From Ken Pettit.

    * Networking / Network Drivers

      - Updates and adaptations to support for TI CC3000 wireless module
        from David Sidrane.  These updates include multi-threading support
        and interface and header file changes to integrate more seamlessly
        with NuttX applications.

    * File Systems:

      - procfs:  Add support for a tiny procfs file system.  The initial
        offering is little more that a proof of concept but may be developed
        further in subsequent releases.
      - NXFFS:  An initial attempt was made to integrate NXFFS with the NAND
        MTD driver.  Changes were made to handle bad blocks.  However, I
        later realized that NXFFS cannot handle NAND because the way that
        is re-writes blocks is incompatible with the NAND ECC handling.
        These changes were backed-out so as not to introduce turmoil, but
        can be re-enabled if needed via configuration option.
      - NXFFS: Make the start up scan of the media a configuration option.
        It just takes to long and is not really necessary!  Those rare cases
        where the scan was helpful can be fixed using flash_eraseall().

    * General Drivers:

      - I2S:  A simple character driver was added to support I2S accesses.
        This driver in its current state is intended only to support I2C
        testing and would not be appropriate to used for any real driver
        application.

    * MTD Drivers

      - Add a container for an MTD device that can be used to provide a
        simple, lightweight interface to configuration data storage that
        resides on some storage media that is wrapped as an MTD device.
        From Ken Pettit.
      - New interface definition for lower half NAND drivers.
      - MTD Nand:  Add MTD NAND driver that will support ONFI devices,
        non-ONFI devices (via table lookup), bad block checking, software
        ECC (Hamming), and will interact with the lower-half, hardware-
        specific, NAND driver.  Based on BSD-compatible Atmel sample code.
      - MTD geometry structure is now packed so that it can support larger
        erase block sizes needed by NAND without increasing the size of
        the geometry structure.
      - SST25:  Add another SST25 SerialFlash driver, sst25xx.c.  This one
        differs from sst25.c in that it supports larger SST25 parts:  In
        the larger parts support page write instead of byte/word writes
        like the smaller parts.  From Ken Pettit.

    * USB Drivers

      - STM32 F1 USB Device: Add support for decoded USB trace strings.
        From David Sidrane.

    * ARM

      - Add more ARM9 cache management functions to flush and invalidate
        D-Cache for DMA support.

    * Atmel AT91 SAMA5D3x Drivers:

      - Many new drivers including CAN, PWM, SSC/I2S
      - PCK:  Add support for programmable clock outputs.
      - NAND: Driver with hardware ECC and DMA support

    * Atmel AT91 SAMA5D3x Boards:

      - SAMA5D3x-EK: Add support for the apps/examples/i2schar test.
      - SAMA5D3x-EK: Provides board-specific memory controller initialize
        for NAND flash.
      - SAMA5D3x-EK: Add support for "auto-mounting" NAND MTD block driver
        or NXFFS file system.

    * Atmel AT91 SAM3/4 Boards:

      - Basic support for the Atmel SAM4E family.  From Mitko.

    * STMicro STM32:

      - Added support for the STM32F429.  From Ken Pettit.
      - Added support for GPIOK and GPIOJ.  From Ken Pettit.

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers

      - STM32 F4 OTG FS/HS Device:  OTG FS device and host drivers extended
        so that they can support either the OTG FS peripheral or the OTG HS
        peripheral (in FS mode).  This was done as a quick way to get USB
        support on the STM32F429 which has only OTG HS.  From Ken Pettit.
      - Added header files and driver framework for the STM32F429 LTDC
        framebuffer driver.  From Ken Pettit.

    * STMicro STM32 Boards:

      - Support for the Spark board was completely by Davide Sidrane.  The
        Spark configuration includes integrated CC3000 wireless support, FAT
        file system on the SerialFlash and a composite device that can be
        used both to export the FAT file system and to provide a serial
        interface.
      - The Mikroe-stm32f4 now uses /dev/config for configuration data
        storage.  From Ken Pettit.
      - Added support for the STM32F429I-Discovery board from Ken Pettit.
      - Added board support for the ViewTool STM32F103/F107 board with the
        STM32F107VCT6 installed.

    * NXP LPC31xx Drivers:

      - USB ECHI HCD:  Add a driver for the low-/full-/high-speed variant
        of the EHCI host controller.

    * NXP LPC31xx Boards:

      - Board-specific USB host support for the Emedded Artists EA3131 board.
        (Missing PCA9532 controls).
      - Add support for the Olimex LPC-H3131 board.  Including USB host
        support (which does not depend on the PCA8532 interface).

    * Kinetis KL Drivers:

      - PWM driver for the Freescale Kinetis KL family from Alan Carvalho
        de Assis.

    * Kinetis KL Boards

      - Freedom-KL25Z:  Add PWM support from Alan Carvalho de Assis.

    * TI Stellaris LM3S

      - Don't initialize .data in start-up logic if not running from FLASH.

    * Applications:

      - apps/platform:  A new home for platform-specific application code.
      - Define a common interface that can be used to manage platform-
        specific configuration data.  From Ken Pettit.
      - apps/examples/configdata:  A unit test for the MTD configuration
        data driver from Ken Pettit.
      - Aapps/platform/mikroe-stm32f4: dd platform-specific storage of
        configuration data for the Mikroe-stm32f4.  From Ken Pettit.
      - apps/examples/cc3000: Fine tuning of memory usage from David Sidrane.
      - apps/system/nxplayer: Play thread stack size is now configurable.
        All NxPlayer threads now have names assigned via pthread_setname_np().
        From Ken Pettit.
      - apps/examples/i2schar:  The I2S test based on the I2S character
        driver.
      - apps/examples/hidkbd/hidkbd_main.c:  Now calls a function named
        arch_usbhost_initialize() that must be provided by the platform-
        specific code.
      - NSH:

          - hexdump:  Add skip= and count= options to the hexdump command.  From Ken Pettit.
          - Allow USB trace without a USB console. From David Sidrane.
          - Mount command updates from Ken Pettit.
          - Add an option to the mkfatfs command to specify FAT12, FAT16, or FAT32.

    * Tools

      - tools/mkctags.sh:  A script for creating ctags from Ken Pettit.

Efforts In Progress.  The following are features that are partially
implemented but present in this release.  They are not likely to be
completed soon.

    * kconfig-fronted Configuration:

      - Conversion of old configurations to use the kconfig-frontends
        tool is an ongoing effort that will continue for some time.
        At this time, only 50% of the configurations have been converted
        to use the kconfig-frontends tools.

Bugfixes (see the ChangeLog for details).  Some of these are very important:

    * File Systems

      - FAT:  In one error return case, the error return value was not being
        set, making the failure look like success. From David Sidrane.
      - mount:  SMART FS must be included in the conditional compilation for
        the set of file systems that require block drivers.  From Daniel
        Palmer.
      - SmartFS: Fixed a minor bug with SMART partition number reporting
        that would only be seen if both partition support and multi-root
        directory support are enabled at the same time.  From Ken Pettit.
      - Deadlock: The inode semaphore must be re-entrant.  Here is the re-
        entrant path that I found:  (1) USB host connects to FLASH drive and
        creates /dev/sda, (2) /dev/sda is mounted, (3) FLASH drive is
        removed but /dev/sda is not destroyed because there is still a
        reference on the device because of the mount, (4) umount() is
        called, taking the inode semaphore, now the driver tries to destroy
        the block driver by calling unregister_blockdriver().  But (5)
        unregister_blockdriver() also takes the inode semaphore causing a
        deadlock if the inode semaphore is not re-entrant.
      - FAT: Fix a typo in the FAT16 formatting logic. Was this ever able to
        format a FAT16 volume?

    * MTD Drivers

      - MTD Partitions:  Fix erase block vs page block confusion. From Ken
        Pettit
      - SST25 Serial Flash:  Improved write performance by fixing a bug that
        prevented operation in the faster write mode.  From David Sidrane.

    * USB Drivers:

      - USB MSC Device:  pthread_join() does not work if called from a
        different task group than the pthread.  This is correct behavior,
        but still a problem.  The correct solution would be configure the
        USB MSC thread to a task, however, this workaround from David
        Sidrane plugs the hole for now.
      - USB CDC/ACM, USB MSC, and Composite Device Classes: Un-initialization
        logic caused re-use of a stale pointer.  Changed to a two pass
        un-initialization for the case of the composite driver:  Memory
        resources are not freed until the second un-initialization pass.
        From David Sidrane.

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - STM32 F1 USB Device: Fix some errors that cause crashes when the USB
        was disconnected.  From David Sidrane.
      - STM32 F1 USB Device: Correct EP0 state handling logic when buffers
        larger than the EP0 packet size are sent.  From David Sidrane.
      - STM32 F1 USB Device: The long outstanding bug involving the handling
        of OUT SETUP commands has been fixed in the STM32 F1 USB device
        driver by David Sidrane.
      - Kconfig:  Add missing setup of CAN TSEG1 and TSEG2 values.  From
        Martin Lederhilger.

    * Tools

      - tools/mkconfig.c:  SMART FS must be included in the conditional
        compilation for the set of writable file systems.  Noted by Daniel
        Palmer.

    * Applications:

      - apps/platform/Makefile:  Was not dealing with the bin sub-directory
        correctly.
      - apps/system/composite/composite_main.c:  The wrong handle was getting
        nullified.  From David Sidrane.

NuttX-6.33
----------

The 100th release of NuttX, Version 6.33, was made on January 30, 2014,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-6.33.tar.gz and
apps-6.33.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

Additional new features and extended functionality:

    * Core OS Interfaces

      - nanosleep() added.  sleep() and usleep() are no longer core OS
        interfaces.  These have been moved into the library and re-implemented
        as simple wrappers around nanosleep().

    * File Systems

      - procfs restructured by Ken Pettit.  Added files for MTD status.
      - procfs extended to show uptime and task group status.
      - procfs now shows stack information.

    * Networking

      - Add support for the SO_LINGER socket option.  Extended from logic
        provided by Jason Jiang.  Enabled with  CONFIG_NET_SOLINGER.
      - TCP write buffering support added.  From Jason Jiang.
      - Changes from Max Holtzberg to improve how network status is
        reported.  New controls to manage carrier detect.

    * Graphics

      - Massive reshuffling of files with little or no logic changes.   This
        reshuffling was necessary to build graphics applications with the
        kernel builds where the graphics application lie in user space and
        the core graphic server likes in kernel space.  Moved much logic out
        of nuttx/graphics to a new user library, libnx.

    * Cortex-A5/A8/A9

      - Existing Cortex-A5 support updated to include Cortex-A8/9.
      - Add the syscall.h header file needed for the Cortex-A architecture.
      - Start-up logic now supports execution from FLASH with .data and
        .bss in SDRAM.  This was not possible prior to this because .bss
        and .data were initialized before SDRAM was configured.

    * Allwinner A10:

      - Basic support for the Allwinner A10 (Cortex-A8) is in place.

    * Allwinner A10 boards

      - Support for the pcDuino v1 board has been added.  This support
        is not yet very mature and still lacks many drivers.  It is a
        good starting point, however, if anyone wants to develop A10
        support.

    * Atmel SAMA5D3X

      - Start-up logic now supports execution from FLASH with .data and
        .bss in SDRAM.  This was not possible prior to this because .bss
        and .data were initialized before SDRAM was configured.

    * Atmel SAMA5D3X Boards

      - Partial logic in place to support the OV2640 camera.  Still needs
        quite a bit of additional logic to be useful.

    * ARMv7-M

      - Add support for high priority, nested interrupts. This change
        effects not only core ARMv-7M logic, but all ARMv7-M MCU logic:
        LM3S, LM4F,  LPC17xx, LPC43xx, SAM3, SAM4, and STM32. See
        http://www.nuttx.org/doku.php?id=wiki:nxinternal:highperfints

    * STMicro STM32

      - Add clocking support for STM32F107 USB OTG FS (which does not yet
        work)
      - Single-wire UART support for the F1 series from Thomas Grubler.

    * STMicro STM32 Boards

      - The Viewtool board can now be configured to support either the
        STM32F103VCT6 or the STM32F107VCT6.
      - The Viewtool STM32F107VCT6 now supports networking with the
        DP83848C module installed.
      - Add support for Viewtool SSD1289-based LCD on the Viewtool
        STM32F103VCT6 board (untested)
      - Add support for the XPT2046 touchscreen controller on the Viewtool
        LCD module connected to the Viewtool STM32F103 board.
      - Added kernel mode build support for the STM3240G-EVAL board.  Added
        a new kernel mode NxWM build configuration
      - C++ static constructor logic from the nuttx/configs/stm3240g-eval/
        directory to the apps/platform/stm3240g-eval/up_cxxinitialize.c
        where is belongs so that it is available in user-space in the kernel
        mode build.
      - Add native Windows build support for the Olimex STM32 P107.  From
        Max Holtzberg
      - Support for the STM32VL-Discovery board. Contributed by Alan
        Carvalho de Assis
      - Added a configuration for testing simple configurations on the
        PX4FMU v2.

    * ZiLOG ZNEO Boards

      - Add an NSH configuration for the Z16F2800100ZCOG ZNEO board.
      - Added support for the Toyaga 16Z ZNEO board.  The 16Z board is
        based on the ZiLOG ZNEOZ16F2811AL20EG part.  See
        https://github.com/toyaga/16z for further information
      - Developed a patch to work around a compiler error that is revealed
        when building the NSH configuration.

    * Architecture-Independent Drivers

      - OV2640 Camera Driver.
      - Support for the Sharp Memory LCD from Librae.

    * Library

      - Pattern matching logic extended to handle set of characters and
        ranges of character values.  From Ken Pettit.
      - sleep() and usleep() moved intot the C library.  These are not
        longer core OS interfaces; they are simple wrappers for the
        nanosleep().
      - Add an implementation of gets_s().
      - Extend fopen() to include support for C11 exclusive open ("x")
        open mode.
      - Add an implementation of stpcpy()
      - strtol(), strtoll, strtoul(), strtoull(), and strtod() from
        libc/string to libc/stdlib where they belong.

    * Header Files

      - Add rsize_t to include/sys/types.h
      - Add the C11 thread.h header file

    * Configuration/Build System

      - Top level Makefile now supports qconfig and/or gconfig targets that
        may be used for configuration.  These may be used if you build
        kconfig-frontends with support for kconfig-qconf and/or
        kconfig-gconf.
      - Add CONFIG_DEBUG_NOOPT.  Now you can independently enable/disable
        debug symbols and optimization
      - File system related header files moved to include/nuttx/fs
      - Video related header files moved to include/nuttx/video
      - Changes for native Windows build: fix creation of a .version file
        if one does not exist.  Make sure that the APPDIR environment
        variable is set before configuring.  From Max Holtzberg.
      - Board configuration sub-directory can now be specified.  The default
        need not be used.  This is  only useful when CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_CUSTOM
        is selected and there is no meaningful default sub-directory.
      - Many functions renamed to better conform with the naming standard:
        up_buttoninit() renamed to board_button_initialize(), up_buttons()
        renamed to board_buttons(), up_irqbutton() renamed to
        board_button_irq(), up_ledinit() renamed to board_led_intialize(),
        up_ledon() renamed to board_led_on(), and up_ledoff() renamed to
        board_led_off(). All prototypes removed from board.h header files.
        Now ONLY prototypes in include/nuttx/arch.h.

    * Applications

      - NSH: Refactor. Separate NSH command handling and command execution
        from NSH line parsing.
      - NSH: Will now support multiple commands on a command line, each
        separated with a semi-colon.
      - NSH: Add support of commands enclosed in back quotes as command
        arguments.
      - NSH: Can now handle arguments that are concatenations of constant
        strings, command return data, application return data, and
        environment variables.
      - NSH: Add true and false commands.
      - NSH: Add support for while-do-done and until-do-done loops.  These
        only work when executing a script file because they depend on the
        ability to seek in the file to implement the looping behaviors.
        Can be conditionally compiled out to reduce footprint.
      - NSH: Loosen up if-then-else-fi syntax to allow a command to be on
        the same line as the then or else tokens like:
        "if true; then echo true; else echo false; fi".  More like bash.
      - NSH: Add a break command that can be executed with a loop to
        terminate the loop immediately.

      - system/inifile:  A simple .INI file parser.
      - system/vi:  Add support for a tiny, VI work-alike editor.  This is
        a minimal full screen editor that works with a terminal emulator
        that using VT100 commands.

Efforts In Progress.  The following are features that are partially
implemented but present in this release.  They are not likely to be
completed soon.

    * kconfig-fronted Configuration:

      - Conversion of old configurations to use the kconfig-frontends
        tool is an ongoing effort that will continue for some time.
        At this time, only 53% of the configurations have been converted
        to use the kconfig-frontends tools.

Bugfixes (see the ChangeLog for details).  Some of these are very important:

    * Core OS

      - Added missing sem_timedwait() system call.

    * Networking

      - Prevent tcp_connect callback from being double freed.  From Max
        Holtzberg
      - uiplib:  Support new definitions and state passing for network
        device status. From Maz Holtzberg.

    * File Systems

      - FAT:  (1) A correction to FAT cluster allocation, and (2) Fix to some
        root directory logic that was conditionally done only for FAT 32.
        Apparently this needs to done for all FAT types.  Both from Andrew
        "Tridge" Tridgell via Lorenz Meier.

    * Binary Formats

      - Fix a small memory leak when attempting to load a program from a file.

    * Cortex-A8/9

      - Fix some errors in the cache invalidation logic (only seem to matter
        for Cortex-A8).
      - Add more nop's after enabling the MMU.  The cortex-a8 seems to need
        these

    * Graphics

      - Fix a typo that caused a compilation error when
        CONFIG_NXCONSOLE_BPP < 8.  From Librae

    * ARMv7-M

      - Correct alignment of RAM vector table.
      - Interrupt handling: Do not disable and enable the IRQ on each
        entry, (2) this interferes with controlling the IRQ interrupt
        setting from interrupt handlers, and (3) up_disable_irq() does
        not work anyway so that this has never done anything.
      - Fix all implementations of up_disable_irq() for all Cortex-M3 and
        M4 architectures:  To enable an interrupt on the Cortex-M3/4 CPU,
        you need to set a bit in the ISER register.  To disable the
        interrupt, you need to set a bit in the ICER register.  Existing
        logic was trying to disable interrupts by clearing the bit in the
        ISER register.  That will not work; writing a '0' to the ISER
        register has no effect.  That  means that up_disable_irq() was
        doing nothing!  It turns out that that is not really important
        because up_disable_irq() is not really used for that purpose.  But
        some spurions STM32 ADC interrupts have been reported to me and this
        turned out to be the cause in that case.  Thanks to Manuel Sthn for
        the tip.

    * STMicro STM32

      - Fix configuration and pin definitions that would prevent building
        USB for the connectivity and performance lines.
      - STM32L15xx: Fix a typo in USB pin definitions
      - Fix pin definition names for SPI2 MOSI and MISO. Noted by Brian Webb
      - Various fixes for STM32F103ZE SPI3 pin mapping definitions.  From
        Steve Redler IV

    * STMicro STM32 Boards

      - Olimex STM32-P107:  Failed to build if SPI3 for UEXT is not remapped.
        From Max Holtzberg

    * x86 Boards

      - Add a configuration option to select the -m32 compiler option when
        building for a 32-bit target on a native 64-bit compiler.  So far,
        only used for the qemu/i486 configuration.
      - Patch from Matt Campbell to fix 'Error: .size expression for idle_stack
        does not evaluate to a constant".

    * Library

      - strftime(): Needs null termination on the generated string.  From
        Max Holtzberg.
      - Typo in ctype.h macro name: iscntrl(), not iscontrol().
      - If there are no arguments (argc == 1), then getopt() will leave the
        optind variable in an undefined state (2014-1-20).
      - ARMv7-M memcpy(): Assembler changes with the gcc-47 distribution
        from ARM mean that we need to be explicit about branch sizes; one
        or more of the wide branch opcodes results in bad table branching.
        From Mike Smith.

    * Configuration/Build System

      - Fixes for some tools/ for Windows build issues from Max Holtzberg.
      - Config.mk: 'cypath' must be called if we are using a Windows native
        toolchain with the Cygwin 'make' to convert paths to proper
        Windows paths.  From Richard Cochran.
      - ARM Makefile: Dependency directory list is now computed from the
        VPATH.  From Richard Cochran.
      - builtin/Makefile: Fixes for native Windows build from Max Holtzberg.
      - Refactor some configuration dependencies:  NSH networking features
        should depend on netutil selections; netutil selections, in turn,
        should depend on networking selections.

    * Applications

      - NSH: Modified the df -h logic to eliminate truncating numbers in
        conversion (like 7900 -> 7M).  From Ken Pettit.

NuttX-7.1
---------

The 101st release of NuttX, Version 7.1, was made on March 15, 2014,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-7.1.tar.gz and
apps-7.1.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

  The previous NuttX version was 6.33.  The NuttX minor version number is
  incremented on each release, but the major version number is incremented
  only when an incompatibility with previous versions is included in the
  release.  In this case, the legacy, manual configuration is no longer
  supported by the NuttX build system beginning with NuttX 7.1.  Only the
  newer configurations generated by the kconfig-frontends tools will generate
  viable NuttX configurations.

  All board configurations in the NuttX source tree have been converted to
  use the newer configuration, but if you have some older style configurations
  for you board, you will need to convert those configurations to use the
  kconfig-frontends tools before taking any new code from the repository. See
  http://www.nuttx.org/doku.php?id=wiki:howtos:convertconfig for some
  guidelines.

Additional new features and extended functionality:

    * Core OS:

      - System time logic now includes logic to measure and calculate the
        CPU load percentage (from David Alessio).  This CPU load logic
        extended to keep counts on each thread.  The per-thread CPU is
        now reported in the procfs under <pid>/loadavg  An asynchronous,
        "external" clock may be used to drive the CPU load calculations
        for more accurate measurements when needed.

    * File Systems:

      - As mentioned above, the per-thread CPU load information is now
        reported in the procfs under <pid>/loadavg.
      - Many file system interfaces have been extended to operate on the
        top-level NuttX pseudo filesystem.  These include rmdir, mkdir,
        rename, and unlink.  This capability can be disabled with
        CONFIG_DISABLE_PSEUDOFS_OPERATIONS in order to keep the footprint
        small.

    * Networking:

      - Numerous updates and improvements to the CC3000 driver from David
        Sidrane.

    * Common Drivers:

      - Defined a mouse interface that is very similar to a touchscreen
        interface, but allows reporting of all mouse buttons.  Also, unlike
        touchscreen drivers, mouse drivers need to report positional data
        with no button is pressed so that the mouse position can drive a
        cursor.
      - Added support for a USB HID boot mouse device.  Cursor support is
        not integrated and must be provided by the application based upon
        the reported mouse data.
      - Support added for the MIO283QT9A LCD from Toby Duckworth.

    * Atmel SAMA4E:

      - Added complete architecture support for the Atmel AT91 SAM4E
        Cortex-M4F parts.

    * Atmel SAM4E Board Support:

      - Add board support for the SAM4E-EK board.

    * Atmel SAM4E Drivers:

      - Added logic to manage the Cortex-M Cache Control block.
      - Developed and integrated an Ethernet MAC driver for the SAM4E.
      - Backported the SAMA5 SPI driver to the SAM3/4 architecture.  The
        SAMA5 version supports both multiple SPI peripherals as needed by the
        SAM3A and SAM3X and also supports DMAC (but not PDC) needed by the
        SAM4E.

    * Atmel SAM D20:

      - Added basic architecture support for the Atmel AT91 SAM D20
        Cortex-M0+ parts.

    * Atmel SAM D20 Board Support:

      - Added basic support for SAM D2 Xplained Pro board.  Currently, the
        NuttShell (NSH) works reliably over a serial port.  An SPI driver
        has also been developed.  Work with the SAM D20 has been temporarily
        stopped, however, in order to focus on the SAM4E-EK.

    * TI Tiva TMC4C123G:

      - Added architecture support for the TI Tiva TM4C123G parts.  This was
        merged into the existing support for the LM3S and LM4F families.
        All directory, file, and function references changed from lm to tiva.

    * TI Tiva TMC4C123G Board Support:

      - Added basic board support for the TM4C123G-Launchpad.  As of this
        release the TM4C123G-Launchpad board support is untested and likely
        incomplete.

    * STMicro STM32 Boards:

      - The Mikroe STM32F4 can now support the newer MIO283QT9A LCD. From
        Toby Duckworth.
      - Miscellaneous changes to better support FPU on STM32F429 Discovery
        from David Alessio.

    * NXP LPC2378 Drivers:

      - Incorporated I2C and SPI drivers for the LPC23xx from Lizhuoyi.

    * QEMU i486 Drivers:

      - New QEMU keyboard and VGA drivers from Lizhuoyi.

    * Documentation:

      - Added a coding standards document.  See
        http://www.nuttx.org/doku.php?id=documentation:codingstandard

    * Configuration/Build System:

      - A configuration option, CONFIG_DEFAULT_SMALL, was added to select
        default values for configuration variables based upon whether you
        want a smaller footprint or more features.  This is not very useful
        if you are modifying existing configurations because then the
        default values do not apply.
      - CONFIG_DEFAULT_SMALL has been defined on all tiny MCU configurations
        so that they do not grow so rapidly when new, optional features are
        added.
      - The legacy, manual configuration is no longer supported by the
        NuttX build system.  Only the newer configurations generated by
        the kconfig-frontends tools will generate viable NuttX
        configurations.  All board configurations in the NuttX source tree
        have been converted to use the newer configuration, but if you have
        some older style configurations for you board, you will need to
        convert those configurations to use the kconfig-frontends tools. See
        http://www.nuttx.org/doku.php?id=wiki:howtos:convertconfig for some
        guidelines.

    * Applications:

      - NSH can now use an EMACS-like command line editor.  This CLE, is
        really more like the traditional readline than is the default, tiny
        the NuttX readline .
      - The touchscreen example can now be configured to work with either a
        touchscreen or a mouse device.
      - Several NSH commands can now be used to operate on objects in the
        top-level pseudo-filesystem: rmdir, mkdir, mv, and rm.  This
        capability can be disabled with CONFIG_DISABLE_PSEUDOFS_OPERATIONS
        in order to keep the footprint small.
      - If both the CPU load feature and the procfs features are enabled,
        then the NSH 'ps' command will show the CPU load used by each
        thread.

Bugfixes (see the ChangeLog for details).  Some of these are very important:

    * Core OS:

      - task_terminate()  always returned an error because the return value
        was not being set correctly (from Gosha).
      - nanosleep()  Fix a missing call to re-enable interrupts (from Jason
        Jiang).

    * File Systems:

      - Fixed an error in the FAT logic that can cause file corruption.  The
        error conditions are rare and only seen with very large files (from
        Andrew Tridgell).  This replaces a previous, partial fix for the same
        problem.
      - Fixed memory leaks in the NXFFS open() and stat() implementations
        (from Lzyy).
      - The interfaces include opendir(), readdir(), et al, were modified so
        that errors will not be reported if you attempt to list a empty
        pseudo-directory.

    * Networking:

      - Fix one place where the connection reference count was not being
        decremented in the socket close() logic.  This is really a cosmetic
        change BUT when CONFIG_DEBUG_NET is enabled, it will cause assertions.
      - Backed out a small part of the NuttX 6.33 write buffering changed.
        David G says that this causes problems in connecting to a server.
      - In DHCPD, there was a place where the logic was calling ntohl()
        inappropriately; the address was already in the correct order.  How
        could DHCPD have worked with this bug?

    * TI Tiva/Stellaris Drivers:

      - Fixed cut'n'paste error that prevented UARTS2-7 from being used with
        the LM4F120 Launchpad.
      - Fixed several errors there were unmasked with UARTs > UART2 are
        enabled (grom Gosha).

    * Allwinner A10 Drivers:

      - Fixed cut'n'paste error that prevented UARTS2-7 from being used with
        the pcDuino.

    * NXP LPC17xx Drivers:

      - Fix an compilation error that crept into the LPC17xx USB host driver.

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - Fix cloned typo in the serial driver:  FLOWCONTROL vs FLOWCONROL.
      - Disable SPI before changing DPI CR1 register (from David Sidrane).
      - stm32 TIM: Set the timer CCMR when selecting timer channel.  From
        David Sidrane.
      - Fix typo in a Makefile: stm32_pwm.c not stm32_psm.c.  Noted by Max
        Kriegleder.

    * Library:

      - More sscanf()  bug fixes from David Sidrane.

    * Header files:

      - cstdbool:  Ignore _Bool8 if CONFIG_C99_BOOL8=y

    * Configuration/Build System:

      - Several changes to restore the broken native Windows build

    * NuttShell (NSH):

      - Use strncpy vs strcpy in the Telnet console logic to avoid
        overruning the username and password buffers (from Bertold Van den
        Bergh).
      - Add a newline after printing the file in the 'cat' command.  This
        prevents the NSH prompt from be in the same line as the final line
        of the file in the case where there is no newline at the end of the
        file.

NuttX-7.2
---------

The 102nd release of NuttX, Version 7.2, was made on April 29, 2014,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-7.2.tar.gz and
apps-7.2.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

Additional new features and extended functionality:

    * Core OS:

      - Add support for CLOCK_REALTIME.  From Macs N.

    * Network Utilities:

      - Add a very primitive NTP client.
      - DNS resolver:  Long needed major clean up for coding style and
        unification of naming conventions (resolv vs dns).

    * Common Drivers:

      - Add a new MTD driver that can be used to contain another driver and
        force its apparent sector size to be 512 bytes.
      - If DCD can support queuing of stall requests, then the USB MSC stall
        work around delays are not necessary.
      - Redesign threading module used with the USB MSC driver.  It was using
        pthreads before and these were changed to a kernel thread.  The reason
        for this has to do with task grouping:  A pthread is a memory of the
        group of the task that started it.  A kernel thread is independent of
        the task that started in (other than knowing it as the parent).  This
        allows me to remove so kludge logic to "deparent" the pthread on
        startup.
      - Update the MIO183QT-9A LCD driver to support reading from the LCD.
        From Toby Duckworth.
      - Timer "upper half" driver and l"lower half" interface definition from
        Bob Doiron.

    * Atmel SAM4E/4S Board Support:

      - All SAM4E configurations updated to run with 120MHz CPU speed and
        with the CMCC enabled.
      - Support for the SAM4S Xplained Pro board from Bob Doiron.
      - Add watchdog driver.  From Bob Doiron.

    * Atmel SAM4E/4S Drivers:

      - Add a USB full speed device driver (UDP) for the SAM4E.
      - Add support in HSMCI and SPI drivers to invalidate cached memory if
        the CMCC is enabled.
      - Add logic to handle SPI word widths > 8
      - Port RTC driver from SAMA5 to SAM3/4.  From Bob Doiron.
      - HSMCI:  Extensions from Bob Doiron needed to support PDC-based HSMCI
        DMA transfers.  Verified on the SAM4S Xplained Pro.

    * Atmel SAMA5:

      - Add support for the SAMA5D36 chip.
      - Add functions to calculate PLLACK, PCK, and MCK frequencies given
        the main clock frequency.
      - Implemented RAM functions.  When booting directly into NOR flash,
        reconfiguring the PLL while executing out of NOR FLASH causes
        crashes.  This was fixed by David Sidrane by implementing RAM
        functions. The killer code is copied and executed from ISRAM and
        the crash is avoided.

    * Atmel SAMA5 Drivers:

      - Add support for the SAMA5D3 DBGU.

    * Atmel SAMA5 Board Support:

      - Add a board support configuration for the Atmel SAMA5D3 Xplained
        board running out of SDRAM.  When booting from SDRAM, start-up logic
        needd to query the PMC registers to determine the MCK, PCK, etc.
      - For all SAMA5 boards, added support for 528MHz clocking.

    * TI Tiva/Stellaris:

      - Modify the logic to disables the interrupts and sets the default
        interrupt priority so that it uses the ICTR to get the number of
        interrupt lines/registers.  This is instead of using some fixed
        number of initializations based a priori knowledge of the number
        of interrupt lines in the MCU.

    * STMicro STM32

      - Add support for the STM401RE.  From Frank Bennett.

    * STMicro STM32 Boards:

      - STM32F4Discovery:  Add support to register keyboard and mouse
        classes if so configured.  From Leo.
      - Add support for the Nucleo-F401RE board.  From Frank Bennett.

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - Add STM32 Ethernet IGMP hashing support.  From Manuel Sthn.
      - OTG FS Host:  USB host tracing added by Leo.

    * Freescale Kinetis

      - Modify the logic to disables the interrupts and sets the default
        interrupt priority so that it uses the ICTR to get the number of
        interrupt lines/registers.  This is instead of using some fixed
        number of initializations based a priori knowledge of the number
        of interrupt lines in the MCU.

    * NXP LPC17xx

      - Modify the logic to disables the interrupts and sets the default
        interrupt priority so that it uses the ICTR to get the number of
        interrupt lines/registers.  This is instead of using some fixed
        number of initializations based a priori knowledge of the number
        of interrupt lines in the MCU.

    * ZiLOG ZNEO Drivers

      - Added ZNEO ESPI driver.

    * Library:

      - Finish incomplete support for ferror().  From Macs N.

    * Documentation:

      - UsbTrace.html:  Add some discussion of the USB monitor.

    * Configuration/Build System:

      - compiler.h:  Add macro UNUSED() that can be used to eliminate
        warnings about variables that are set to values that are not
        used.

    * Debugging Support:

      - Add a configuration option to enable dumping of the USB trace buffer
        on assertion.

    * Applications:

      - IGMP Example:  Fill out Kconfig file; update makefile so that the
        IGMP example can be used as an NSH built-in application. From Manuel
        Sthn.
      - lcdrw Example:  Fill out empty Kconfig file.
      - touchscreen Example:  Add a configuration option to indicate if
        architecture-specific initialized is required, yes or no.
      - System usbmsc:  Back out the USBMSC daemon... it is no longer needed
        with the recent fix to the USBMSC class driver.
      - NSH: malloc/free IOBUFFER for 'cat' and 'hexdump' commands instead of
        using the stack.  From Bob Doiron.
      - cpuhog, serialblaster, and serialrx Examples:  Stress test examples
        added by Bob Doiron.

Bugfixes (see the ChangeLog for details).  Some of these are very important:

    * Core OS:

      - errno_get_errno_ptr() and getpid():  Add some checks.  If these
        functions are called very early in initialization before the tasking
        structures are initialized, they would not behave properly.

    * Networking:

      - IGMP-related bug fixes from Manuel Sthn.
      - In netdev_findbyaddr(), skip network devices that are in the "down"
        state.  It does not make sense to consider an address match with a
        "down" device.  From Brennan Ashton.

    * Network Utilities:

      - DHCPD:  The correct value of the PAD option.  Should be zero, not
        one.  From Brennan Ashton.
      - Corrections to the NTP client from Manuel Stuehn.

    * Common Drivers:

      - usbhost.h:  Fix some USB HID-related conditional compilation.  From Leo.
      - USB HID mouse driver: Don't include NAKs from the device in the error
        count.  From Leo.

    * TI Tiva/Stellaris:

      - Add corrected control logic for TM4C125GXL based on logic from Daniel
        Carvalho with modifications.  The LM4F120 also works well with this
        change.

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - STM32 F2 SPI:  Correct a mapping for SPI MOSI pin.  From dlsitzer.
      - OTG FS Host:  Fixes related to low-speed devices and interrupt
        endpoints from Leo.  Necessary in order to use a USB HID mouse
        device.
      - STM32 SDIO:  The dmaflight method must be conditioned on
        CONFIG_SDIO_PREFLIGHT.  Noted by Pelle Windestam.
      - Sourceforge Ticket #26.  up_prioritize_irq should not be called
        if CONFIG_ARCH_IRQPRIO is not defined.

    * Atmel SAM3/4:

      - Fix some backward conditional compilation in the start-up logic.
      - Fix initialization of the default interrupt priorities.  This is
        a critical bug fix!
      - SAM4S: Fix error in macros that disable peripheral clocking.  From
        Bob Doiron.

    * Atmel SAMA5:

      - Fix double mapping of SDRAM when executing out of SDRAM.  In this
        case, the SDRAM was already mapping in arm_head.S.
      - In clock configuration, the BMS bit handling was fixed to match
        what the HW really does.  From David Sidrane.
      - TLB Bufferable bit did not do what I thought it was going to do.
        I though I was selecting a write-through cache, but the result was
        that all caching was disabled and NOR FLASH accesses were very slow.
      - Move the un-definitions of __ramfuncs__ from the clock configuration
        .c file to the .h file.  Otherwise, the attribute will be applied
        differently for the prototype and the function definition.
        Sourceforge patch 38 from Luciano Neri.

    * Atmel SAMA5 Drivers:

      - Fix a case in the UDPHS driver where received status was not being
        cleared, causing OUT SETUP commands to fail.
      - TWI data sending fails to increment the number of byes transferred
        on first byte sent.  from David Sidrane.
      - If running from SDRAM, then BOARD_MCK_FREQUENCY is not a constant
        and cannot be used in conditional compilation.  All drivers fixed
        EXCEPT for the PWM and Timer/Counter drivers which will need some
        more extensive redesign.

    * Atmel SAMA5 Boards:

      - SAMA5D3x-EK: The red LED is controlled by PE24 which is also the
        camera/ISI interface reset line.  So if the a camera is installed,
        then we must avoid controlling the red LED or we inadvertently
        also reset the camera module.  Noted by David Sidrane.
      - Header files reference type xcpt_t in certain configurations and
        so must include nuttx/irq.h.  This is Sourceforge bug 25 submitted
        by Luciano Neri.

    * NXP LPC17xx Drivers

      - arm/src/lpc17xx/Kconfig and lpc17_ethernet.c:  The default interrupt
         priority should be default, not the highest priority (2014-4-19).

    * ZiLOG ZNEO

      - Fix calculation of timer reload and prescaler.  The timer frequency
        was way too fast.

    * Library:

      - strncpy():  Change ordering of test and copy.  Logic would have
        failed if n=0; one byte was always copying before testing
        for the end of the copy.
      - Fix a counting error in the return value from sscanf().  Noted by
        kfrolov.  Also, sscanf() should return EOF if no values were
        converted.
      - Fix a logic error in ftell().  It was simply using the file offset
        and did not take into account data buffered in memory.  From Macs N.
      - sccanf():  Use stroul() vs strol() with %u format otherwise, range
        of values is restricted because of sign bit. From kfrolov.

    * Configuration/Build System:

      - Fix a build error that occurs when only USB device tracing is enabled.

    * NuttShell (NSH):

      - Fix NuttShell version number display in the NSH welcome message.
        version.h was not being included.

    * Other Applications:

      - sysinfo:  CONFIG_VERSION_BUILD is a string an needs to be
        printed with %s, not %d.  Noted by Librae.
      - nxplayer:  Compilation failure in one configuration reported by
        Manuel Stuhn.
      - System sdcard:  Remove an STM32 dependency.  From Bob Doiron.
      - telnetd Example:  Naming is confused.  In someplaces 'telnetd',
        and in others 'shell.'  All changes to telnetd.  Noted by Pelle
        Windestam.

NuttX-7.3
---------

The 103rd release of NuttX, Version 7.3, was made on June 25, 2014,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-7.3.tar.gz and
apps-7.3.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

Additional new features and extended functionality:

    * Core OS:

      - Dynamic loader: Framework to support Pascal P-Code as a binary
        format that can be exec'ed from a file system.
      - Dynamic Loader:  Extend the binfmt interface to handle error
        conditions where format-specific clean-up is needed in the event
        of error conditions.  This is needed by the P-Code binfmt.

    * Networking

      - IOB:  Add a generic I/O buffer chain logic.  This logic uses small,
        pre-allocated buffers that can be chained together to support
        transfers of any size, using fewer resources and also without
        committing in advance to a TCP window size.  There is now only
        one I/O type used in the networking and it is these I/O buffer
        chains.
      - TCP Write Buffering:  TCP write buffering logic converted to use
        I/O buffer chains.
      - TCP Read-Ahead Buffering:  TCP read-ahead buffering logic converted
        to use I/O buffer chains.
      - Includes logic to support throttling of read-ahead buffering if
        the read-ahead buffering is competing with write buffering for
        I/O buffers.
      - Raw Sockets:  Add support for the AF_PACKET socket family.  From
        Daniel Lazlo Sitzer.

    * Common Drivers:

      - W25 Serial FLASH driver extended by Mark Whitehorn to support the
        8Mbit W25Q80BV part.
      - Add support for Fujitsu MB85RS1MT RAMTRON part.  From Charles Ash.
      - Enhancements to the generic timer interface to support capture mode
        from Bob Doiron.
      - Add an rxflowcontrol method to the serial interface to better
        support RX flow control. This involves common changes in addition to minor updates to all MCU-specific serial drivers (only fully implemented for the STM32). From Jussi Kivilinna.

    * Atmel SAM4C

      - Add support for the SAM4CM family.  From Max Neklyudov.

    * Atmel SAM4E/4S Drivers:

      - RTT driver from Bob Doiron.  Also added high resolution RTC
        emulation using the RTT for the sub-second counter.

    * Atmel SAM4E/4S Board Support:

      - The SAM4S Xplained Pro now uses the extended timer/counter
        features. From Bob Doiron.
      - Added a touchscreen and LCD driver for the SAM4E-EK board (the LCD,
        however, not yet fully functional).

    * Atmel SAMA5:

      - Optimized, high performance, assembly language memcpy().  This is
        the same optimized memcpy() function that Mike Smith brought in
        for the ARMv7-M with minor tweaks by David Sidrane to work with
        the ARMv7-A.
      - Basic support added for the SAMA5D4 family.

    * Atmel SAMA5 Drivers:

      - SAMA5D4:  New drivers unique to the SAMA5D4: XDMAC, SAIC, and
        others.

    * Atmel SAMA5 Board Support:

      - SAMA5D4-MB:  Initial board support for the SAMA5D4-MB/EK boards.

    * STMicro STM32

      - Add support for the STM32152 and STM32162 Medium+ density parts
        (plus miscellaneous other improvements to the original STM32151
        logic).  From Jussi Kivilinna and Sami Pelkonen.

    * STMicro STM32 Boards:

      - Support for the Olimex STM32 H405 board contributed by Martin
        Lederhilger.

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - Implement the rxflowcontrol method to the serial interface to better
        support RX flow control. From Jussi Kivilinna.

    * NXP LPC17xx Drivers:

      - Added support for the RTC, ADC, DAC, Timers, PWM and MCPWM
        drivers.  From Max (himax).

    * NXP LPC17xx Boards:

      - Support for the RTC, ADC, DAC, Timers, PWM and MCPWM integrated
        in the LPCXpresso LPC1768 board support.  From Max (himax).

    * Library:

      - Add support for seek-able streams.

    * Configuration/Build System:

      - Restructured network directories, header files, and naming to
        better modularize the networking and to better integrate the
        networking with the rest of NuttX.

    * Applications:

      - prun:  An NSH built-in application that can be used to run
        Pascal P-Code programs either programatically or from the NSH
        command line.
      - netpkt:  A "raw" socket test from Lazlo Sitzer.
      - hex2bin:  A library and built-in task to convert from
        Intel HEX to binary format.  It can write the binary data to a file or it can store the binary data to memory (to support, for example, a loader).

Bugfixes.  Only the most critical bugfixes are listed here (see the ChangeLog for the complete list of bugfixes and for additional, more detailed bugfix information):

    * Core OS:

      - Dynamic Loader: Fix an error in a symbol table search function.
        Noted by Pelle Windestam.
      - Dynamic Loader:  Fix a critical error in exec(); argv was not
        being passed.
      - mq_notify:  Test for a valid signal number was inverted; this
        function could not have been working correctly before???  From
        eero.nurkkala.
      - Fix typo in conditional compilation:  CONFIG_CLOCK_MONOTONIC vs.
        CLOCK_MONOTONIC.  From Manuel Sthn.

    * Graphics

      - Fix typos in several RGB conversion macros.

    * Networking:

      - Modify TCP timout handling to provent situations where connections
        may not be freed. From Max Holtzberg.
      - Improved TCP fallback allocation logic from Max Holtzberg. Also,
        fallback mechanism is disabled when SO_LINGER is to prevent
        deadlocks.
      - Write Buffering:  Add checks from buffer allocation failures. From
        Max/Himax.

    * Network Utilities:

      - webserver: httpd_fs_open() should return OK on success and ERROR on
        failure, not 1 and 0.

    * Common Drivers:

      - Make sure that all references to up_prioritize_irq() are
        conditioned on CONFIG_ARCH_IRQPRIO.  Problem noted by Mike Smith.
      - CC3000: Correct SPI mode for CC3000 is CPOL=0 CHPA=1. From Jussi
        Kivilinna.
      - CC3000: Fix a race condition in thread start-up logic. From Jussi
        Kivilinna.
      - CC3000: Additional fixes including a compilation failure if POLL is
        enabled. From Jussi Kivilinna.

    * USB Drivers:

      - CDC/ACM and PL2303 device:  Reset RX head to avoid resending last
        serial data when USB cable disconnected/re-connected.  From
        Lizhuoyi.

    * TI Tiva/Stellaris Boards:

      - The Nucleo-F401RE has no on-board crystals and, hence, needs to run
        with the PLL input from the on-chip HSI clock.

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - Serial:  Handle configuration for the case of 8-bit data with
        parity.  From Freddie Chopin.

    * Atmel SAM3/4 Boards:

      - There was a cloned error in all SAM3/4 board configurations (and
        for a few other architectures as well).  Button interrupts not
        being disabled after being detached.  As a result, unexpected
        interrupts could be received after the button interrupt was
        detached.

    * Atmel SAMA5:

      - Fix some critical typos in the SAMA5D3 DMA definitions.

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers

      - I2C: Add an alternative I2C implementation for the STM32 F103 that
        works around errata in that specific part.  From Patrizio Simona.
      - RTCC:  Add retry logic to RTC initialization. It sometimes takes
        longer for the RTC to initialize, at least as noted on an F2 part.
        From Daniel Lazlo Sitzer.

    * NXP LPC17xx Drivers

      - GPDMA:  Fix an error when DMA is started:  The read-modify-write
        fails when the DMA is started.  This is because the value read is
        not the same as the value set (on write it is the number of
        transfers to do; on read it is the number of transfers completed).
        From Lizhuoyi.

    * Library:

      - snprintf():  If the size passed to snprintf() is zero, then
        snprintf() must write nothing, but instead return the size of the
        buffer needed to hold the entire string.  From Sami Pelkonen.

    * Configuration/Build System:

      - The alternate console device CONFIG_NSH_CONDEV must not be defined
        unconditionally. This causes errors when using Telnet sessions.
        This was solved by adding CONFIG_NSH_ALTCONDEV: CONFIG_NSH_ALTCONDEV enables or disables the feature then, if
        enabled, CONFIG_NSH_CONDEV provides the alternative console
        device name.
      - Many files: Convert all old-style GCC variadic macros to the C99
        form.  Recent GCC changes tightens up that behavior and can cause
        some problems (at least for the IAR compiler for some reason).
        Noted by Bob Grimes.
      - tools/configure.sh:  In-place SED edit messes up permissions on
        windows. From Hannes Delago.

    * Build Tools:

      - tools/mkfsdata.pl:  Apparently, the trailing the 0x00 in http
        server files is seen as a bug in javascript and images.  From
        Max/Himax.

    * Other Applications:

      - I2C Tool:  Fix to show the updated register address on each
        fetch (vs. showing the same starting address each time).  From
        Ryan VanSickle.
      - CLE was not returning the terminating newline character. But
        reported by Max kriegleder.

NuttX-7.4
---------

The 104th release of NuttX, Version 7.4, was made on August 15, 2014,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-7.4.tar.gz and
apps-7.4.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

Additional new features and extended functionality:

    * Core OS:

      - Beginnings of a crypto/ subsystem from Max Neklyudov
      - Tickless operation:  NuttX now supports a mode with no periodic
        timer interrupts.  Rather, timed events are handle via an interval
        timer.  This (1) lowers the rate of interrupt processing to timer
        events, (2) gives much high timing resolution, and (3) allows lower
        power modes of operation where the CPU is not constantly being
        interrupted by the timer.
      - Restructured the OS files under sched/ to better support the already
        modular nature of the RTOS.

    * Networking

      - Substantial directory and header file reorganization and renaming to
        make the NuttX networking implementation more modular.
      - Add network device ioctl to access PHY registers. From Daniel Lazlo
        Sitzer

    * Binary Loader:

      - Various changes associated with symbol tables from Pelle Windestam.

    * Graphics:

      - colorcmp(): New utility to compare two colors.
      - The initial background color is now configurable.  Includes logic to
        eliminates multiple background updates to get the right color.
      - Minor configuration changes to handle mouse X/Y and touchscreen
        X/Y differently.

    * File System/Block Drivers:

      - SmartFS: Increase some variables from uint16_t to uint32_t to handle
        larger device sizes.  From Ken Pettit.
      - Add configurable AES encryption support to the block-to-character
        (BCH) driver.  This allows any block device to be accessed as an
        encrypted character device.  From  Max Nekludov
      - Add an MTD layer that will add read-ahead or write buffering to any
        MTD driver (incomplete).
      - Automounter:  Add support for an auto-mounter that will automatically
        mount and unmount a file system a media is inserted and removed

    * Audio/Audio Drivers

      - WM8904 audio CODEC driver.
      - PCM .WAV file decoder. Fast forward implemented with sub-sampling
        (currently no rewind support).
      - Add a NULL audio device that can be used to simply unit-level testing
        of audio decoders.
      - Audio subsystem now supports interfaces for fast-forward and rewind
        needed by CMediaPlayer; add hooks for equalizer settings needed by
        the WM8904 CODEC.

    * Other Common Drivers:

      - MTD: Extend erase block size to 18-bits in order (decrease block
        size to 14-bits) to handle parts with large erase blocks. From Kosma
        Moczek
      - maxTouch:  Add support for the Atmel maXTouch touchscreen controller.

    * Host Simulation:

      - Provides the timers needed to support the Tickless mode of operation.

    * Atmel SAM4C:

      - Add SAM4CM IPC register header file.  From Max Neklyudov
      - Various fixes PMC and clock configuration for the SAM4CM port from
        Max Neklyudov

    * Atmel SAM4E/4S Drivers:

      - SAM4 AES driver.  Contributed by Max Neklyudov

    * Atmel SAMA5:

      - Add logic to redirect all SAMA5D4 interrupts to the AIC
      - Add a configuration option to reserve DRAM for a framebuffer when
        executing out of DRAM.  This optional was available before when
        executing out of NOR, but needs to work a little differently in
        this case.
      - Add SAMA5 slow (32.768KHz) clock support.
      - Add support for the ARM L2CC-PL310 L2 cache.  The system runs with
        L2CC cache enabled but there is some issues still with the LCD DMA;
        I suspect that the memory timing configuration for L2CC needs to
        be tuned.
      - Provides the timers needed to support the Tickless mode of operation.

    * Atmel SAMA5 Drivers:

      - XDMAC-based HSCMI driver for the SAMA5D4
      - Adapt the SAMA5D3 LCDC driver to work with the SAMA5D4 which has
        no hardware cursor.
      - PIO: Add a new interface sam_pio_forceclk() that can be used to
        force PIO clocking on.  I am afraid I was too conservative with
        PIO clocking in the initial design; this is the price.
      - TWI:  Now supports the up_i2creset() method.
      - TWI:  Use sam_pio_forceclk() so that we can read the current state
        of an open-drain output in the TWI reset logic.
      - SSC:  SCC Frame Synch Delay and Start Delay are now configurable.
      - PCK:  Add the slow clock and the main clocks as options for the
        PCK configuration.
      - Timer/Counter: Can now handle non-constant BOARD_MCK_FREQUENCY. Also
        now supports methods to attach client interrupt handlers
      - One shot and free-running timers.  These are wrappers around the low
        level timer/counter logic to provide one-shot and free-running
        timers.  These were developed to support the Tickless operation, but
        can be used for any purpose.

    * Atmel SAMA5 Board Support:

      - Add a boot loader that runs from ISRAM and loads an Intel HEX file
        into DRAM.
      - Add a configuration that will load a bootloader into AT25 Serial
        FLASH
      - SAMA5D4-EK NSH configuration supports many more features: RTC, HSCMI
        card detection, maXTouch touchscreen, TM7000 LCD, the command line
        media player (currently using the NULL audio device), automounter,
        and others.
      - SAMA5D4-EK:  Add an NxWM configuration using the TM7000 LCD with
        the maXTouch multi-touch touchscreen.
      - SAMA5D4-EK NxWM: Uses new, larger icons in configuration instead of
        scaling.
      - SAMA5D4-EK NxWM: The NxPlayer and audio system are now enabled in
        the default configuration (but currently using the NULL audio
        device).  The automounter is used to automatically mount media
        on an SD card.
      - SAMA5D3x-EK:  Add a configuration to support the command line
        NxPlayer and to verify the WM8904 CODEC driver.

    * STMicro STM32:

      -  Add support for the STM32F103RC and RD.  From Kosma Moczek
      -  Add a procfs entry to show the state of the CCM heap usage.
         From Pelle Winderstam

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - Unconfigure GPIO pins when closing a serial port to prevent back
        effects from back-powering on the TX pin. From Kosma Moczek

    * NXP LPC17xx Drivers:

      - ADC:  Added burstmode ADC conversion mode, with CONFIG_ADC_BURSTMODE
        option in Kconfig.  From Max
      - Ethernet: Added option to use the kernel worker thread to do most of
        the workload with CONFIG_NET_WORKER_THREAD option in Kconfig.  From Max
      - Ethernet: Critical bugfix: From time to time (after some hours) the
        Ethernet receiver would lose one receive interrupt and the IP stack
        never recover because there is no receive watchdog as the transmit
        watchdog.  From Max

    * NXP LPC17xx Boards:

      - mbed: Port ADC, DAC, and PWM logic from the configs/zkit-arm-1769.
        From Max
      - mbed:  Eliminated a problem with PHY DP83848C : it doesn't need a
        specific initialization on mbed.  From Max

    * Library:

      - Adds support for localtime.  From Max Neklyudov

    * Configuration/Build System:

      - Make variable definitions 'static const' when possible to save RAM
        usage.  From Kosma Moczek

    * Applications:

      - sysem/mdio:  New PHY tool from Daniel Lazlo Sizter.
      - NSH:  Networking logic modified to handler the case of SLIP
        transport.  From Max Neklyudov.
      - NSH:  Add a configuration to use a USB keyboard for the stdin
        device.
      - NSH:  Software assigned MAC address is now configurable. From Lazlo.
      - NSH:  Also add an option to let platform-specific logic select the
        MAC address.
      - NSH:  There is now a configuration option that will bring up the
        network on an separate thread.  Since the network bring-up is
        asynchronous, there are no serial console start-up delays due
        to the network negotiation time.
      - NxPlayer: Changes to integrate with Ken's NxWM::CMediaPlayer.
      - NxPlayer: Add interfaces for fast-forward and rewind needed by
        CMediaPlayer; add interface for equalizer settings needed by the
        WM8904.
      - NxPlayer:  Supports new way of identifying the end of the audio
        stream (see the Audio section above).
      - Sudoku:  Add a sudoku game.

Bugfixes.  Only the most critical bugfixes are listed here (see the ChangeLog for the complete list of bugfixes and for additional, more detailed bugfix information):

    * Graphics:

      - NxConsole: Fix scrolling for the case of the framebuffer device.  In
        this case, the logic for clearing the vacated region at the bottom
        was missing so garbage would scroll up from the last, uncleared
        line.

    * Networking:

      - Important fix to the read-ahead buffer queue management: Consumed
        bytes were being trimmed from the head of the queue, but the queue
        head itself was not being updated.  From Rony XLN.
      - Fix an error in SLIP escaping.  From Max Neklyudov

    * Network Utilities:

      - Fix an include file ordering problem when CONFIG_NET_STATISTICS=y.
      - Move statistics from uip.h to new netstats.h  to remove a circular
        inclusion problem
      - Various fixes for networking and tiny webserver from Max
      - webclient:  Fix to offset calculation from Rony Xln.  Prevents 0x0a
        at the beginning of lines.
      - webserver:  Fix some configuration usage issues.  From Max.
      - webserver:  Missing logic to close sockets on loop termination.

    * File System / Block Drivers:

      - SmartFS:  Fix for a bug that would show up if CONFIG_MTD_BYTE_WRITE
        was not selected and the SMART sector size was larger than the MTD
        device's block size (like it would be if using SMARTFS on larger
        flash devices).  From Ken Pettit.

    * Audio:

      - Change how the end of the audio stream is detected by the leaf audio
        component.  This used to be done by looking for the first partial
        buffer.  That does not work with the in-place sub-sampling performed
        by the PCM decoder:  That always reduces the size of the buffer so
        that all buffers only partially filled by the time they get to the
        leaf.  Now, a flag is set in the audio buffer flags set to indicate
        the final buffer in the stream.

    * Common Drivers:

      - RAMLOG putc() method needs to set the errno and return EOF on a
        failure.
      - Add missing configuration option to select the MAX11802 touchscreen
        controller. From Petteri Aimonen

    * Atmel SAMA5D3/4:

      - Fix logic in conversion of physical and virtual DRAM addresses when
        running out of DRAM.  This is an important bug fix for the SAMA5D3
        and 4 when running out of DRAM .
      - Critical SAMA5D3 and 4 bug fix:  PIO clocking must be enabled for
        all input pins or else the value that is read never changes.

    * Atmel SAMA5D3/4 Drivers:

      - OHCI: Fix an error in a DEBUGASSERT statement.  Caused an
        assertion to fire inappropriately when a low- or full-speed device
        was removed and CONFIG_DEBUG=y
      - OHCI: Pointers to allocated port values were not being
        nullified after being deallocated.  This caused some assertions
        to fire when debug was enabled
      - SSC:  Needs to account for data offset in audio buffer

    * ARMv7-M:

      - Correct the initial value of the BASEPRI register.  This was
        apparently never being initialized! From Max

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - I2C:  Fix missing configuration of GPIO pins in I2C driver.  Fix
        from Alex D.
      - STM32 OTGFS device:  Various changes to try to reduce that amount of
        time in interrupts handles and with interrupts disabled.  From
        Petteri Aimonen

    * Atmel SAM3/4 Drivers:

      - Ethernet: Wrong bits being cleared before OR-ing in new settings.
      - Ethernet: Fix an error in the function that determines the number
        of free TX descriptors.  This is an important bugfix on busy
        networks.
      - I2C: Test for read or write operation was reversed.  How could
        this have worked before?

    * Atmel SAM3/4 Boards:

      - SAM4S Xplained-Pro:  Correct description of LEDs and usage. From
        Kosma Moczek

    * Atmel SAMA5:

      - PIO: Fix definitions that could disable PIO interrupt support if only
        PIOE interrupts were enabled
      - PIO: Macro SAM_PION_VBASE is not define-able for the SAMA5D4 and must
        be replaced with a table lookup.
      - PIO: Fix a typo in Schmitt trigger configuration; Configure pin as a
        vanilla input first so that final pin configuration is more read-able
        (i.e., easier to debug)
      - PIO: Logic for Schmitt trigger selection backward
      - SAMA5D4:  Correct system timer frequency.  Input clock is MCK/2, not MCK.

    * Atmel SAMA5 Drivers:

      - Ethernet: Wrong bits being cleared before OR-ing in new settings.
      - Ethernet: Fix an error in the function that determines the number
        of free TX descriptors.  This is an important bugfix on busy
        networks.
      - HSMCI: The 8-byte SCR transfer was failing silently with the DMA
        transfer, leaving the SD card in single bit mode.  Fixed by adding
        a non-DMA read transfer mode.
      - HSMCI: Fix a problem on card insertion/removal callback handling.
        Interrupts were being disable so that the callbacks occurred with
        interrupts disabled.  This resulted in loss of some interrupts and
        some not-so-good behaviors.  The solution is to perform all
        callbacks on the work thread unconditionally

    * Atmel SAMA5 Boards:

      - PIO: Fix some cloned errors in SAM GPIO interrupt setup

    * NXP LPC17xx Drivers:

      - Ethernet:  Comment out an assertion that is reported to fire
        inappropriately.  From Max

    * Library:

      - stdint.h: Correct naming of [U]INT_LEASTn_{MAX|MIN} and
        [U]INT_FASTn{MAX|MIN}. From Kosma Moczek
      - unistd.h: POSIX definitions should be defined to a value. rom Kosma
        Moczek
      - Fixes associated with rint() and related interfaces in the math
        library.

    * Configuration/Build System:

      - NAME_MAX not available on SunOS; use FILENAME_MAX or MAXNAMELEN.
        Noted by Douglas Beattie

    * Applications:

      - NSH: if # appears on line, need to comment ignore additional
        commands on the line
      - NxPlayer:  Check for file read errors and end-of-file with zero
        bytes read.  Other error handling corrected as well.
      - NxPlayer:  NxPlayer needs to set curbyte field to zero before
        enqueuing a buffer.  Otherwise, it looks like beginning of the
        buffer has already been consumed.

NuttX-7.5
---------

The 105th release of NuttX, Version 7.5, was made on September 28, 2014,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-7.5.tar.gz and
apps-7.5.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

Additional new features and extended functionality:

    * Core OS:

      - Watchdog Timer Allocation:  (1) If we run out of pre-allocated
        watchdog times, the logic will now allocate additional timers
        from the heap.  A reserve of pre-allocated watchdog timers is
        maintained so that there will always be timers available for
        interrupt handlers. (2) Added support for statically allocated
        watchdog timer
      - Address Environment Support:  (2) New OS APIs integrated into all
        platform-specific context switching logic (up_block_task(),
        up_unblock_task(), _exit(), and others).
      - Kernel Build Support: (1) The MPU based "kernel build" renamed to a
        protected build (CONFIG_BUILD_PROTECTED); added support for the a
        new MMU-based "kernel build" (CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL), (2) The system
        call library can now be built with CONFIG_NUTTX_KERNEL.  New
        selection: CONFIG_LIB_SYSCALL.
      - System Startup:  Add configuration options to start the system from
        a program on a file system (versus an address in memory).
      - Startup Parameter Passing. There used to be two ways to pass
        parameters to new tasks, depending upon the configuration:  Either
        (1) argv[] as created as an array with each string strdup'ed.  Or
        (2) argv[] array and strings were created on the stack before the
        new task was started.   Now, there is only one way, way (1).  Way
        (2) might be slightly more compact, but this is not worth carry the
        complexity of two different ways of doing the same thing.
      - Board Initialization: Add capability to perform initial board
        initialization on a separate worker thread.  This is needed because
        there are many cases where initialization logic cannot execute on
        the start-up/IDLE thread.  That is because blocking or waiting is
        not permitted on the IDLE thread.

    * Memory Management:

      - Granule Allocator:  (1) Add a new function to reserve un-allocatable
        regions in the granule heap.  (2) Add interfaces to support
        un-initializing a granule allocator.
      - Page Allocator:  Add a simple physical page allocator based on the
        existing NuttX granule allocator.  I am not certain if the granule
        allocator is sufficiently deterministic for long range use, but it
        gets get a page allocator in place for testing very quickly.
      - Remove CONFIG_MM_MULTIHEAP.  Non-multiheap operation is no longer
        supported.
      - sbrk():  sbrk() is now supported in the kernel build to permit
        dynamically sized, per-process heaps.
      - Per-Process Heaps:  Space at the beginning of the process data space
        is now reserved for user heap management structures.  In the kernel
        build mode, these heap structures are shared between the kernel and
        use code in order to allocate user-specific data.
      - User Heap Management:  When a privileged thread exits, we have to
        use the kernel allocator to free memory; when an unprivileged thread
        exits, we don't have to do anything... heap memory will be cleaned
        up when the address environment is torn down.
      - Inter-Process Shared Memory Support:  (1) Add implementation and
        documentation for shmget(), shmctl(), shmat(), and shmdt().  (2)
        Add system system calls to support the user call gate to the shared
        memory interfaces.  (3) Add platform-specific interface definitions
        needed to support the shared memory feature.
      - Virtual Page Allocator:  Add support for a per-process virtual page
        allocator.  This is a new member of the task_group_s structure.  The
        allocator must be initialized when a new user process is started and
        uninitialize when the process group is finally destroyed.  It is
        used by shmat() and shmdt() to pick the virtual address onto which
        to map the shared physical memory.

    * File Systems/Block Drivers/MTD:

      - SMART FS and SMART FS procfs updates from Ken Pettit.
      - The MTD Read-ahead/Write buffer layer appears is now functional.

    * Binary Formats:

      - Add logic to initialize the per-process user heap when each user
        process is started.

    * Graphics:

      - Change all occurrences of NxConsole to NxTerm.

    * Networking:

      - PHY Interrupts: (1) Standardize a PHY interrupt attachment
        interface. (2) Add support for an ioctl that can be used to notify
        an application when there is a change in the network status
        signalled by a PHY interrupt.
      - Improved Send Logic:  In the past, the first packet send to a new
        network peer would fail; there would be no entry in the ARP table
        for the peer and so an ARP request could replace that first packet.
        Now as an option if CONFIG_NET_ARP_SEND=y, all send logic will (1)
        check if the peer MAC address is in the ARP table and, if not, (2)
        send ARP requests periodically to get the mapping and (3) wait for
        the ARP response.  Then (4) when the ARP response is received then
        the actual send logic will be initiated.  Thus there may be a delay
        with the first packet sent to a new peer, but the packet should not
        be lost

    * Host Simulation:

      - Emulated SPI FLASH driver for the sim target from Ken Pettit.

    * Intel x86:

      - The default host is now x86_64 and the -m32 option will be
        automatically selected for simulation builds.

    * Intel 8051 Family:

      - Removed all support for the 8051 family architecture from the NuttX
        source tree.  The obsoleted code along with the removal patch can
        now be found at misc/Obsoleted/.  This code was removed because (1)
        although some functionality has been demonstrated, I am not aware of
        any really successful ports of NuttX to any 8051, and (2) the 8051,
        with its hardware stack, forces limitations and complications to the
        other architectures and make growth and development of NuttX more
        complex.

    * ZiLOG ZNeo Boards:

      - configs/16z:  Support for this board has been removed from the NuttX
        source tree (but still can be found in the misc/Obsoleted
        directory). This port is not ready for usage but may return to the
        NuttX tree at some point in the future.

    * Atmel SAM3/4 Boards:

      - SAM4E-EK: Add (1) a fully-functional ILI9341-based LCD driver and
        (2) a fully-functional NxWM configuration.

    * ARMv7-A:

      - Address Environments:  Add support for application address
        environments using the Cortex-A MMU.  Implement standardized
        platform-specific interfaces of NuttX address environment
        support.
      - Cache Operations:  Implement standardized, platform-specific cache
        operations.  These are called from the ELF loader in order to flush
        D-cache and invalidate I-cache after an ELF module has been loaded
        into memory. With this change, ELF modules work correctly on the
        SAMA5/Cortex-A platform.
      - Kernel Build: (1) Add implementations of system call gate. (2) Add
        CRT0 start-up file that can be linked with separately built user
        programs.  (3) Add support for delivery of use-mode signals in the
        kernel build.  (4) Add logic to initialize the per-process user heap
        when each user process is started.  (5) ARMv7-A exception handling
        needs to work a little differently if we support user mode
        processes.  This is because R13 and R14 are paged differently
        between user and SVC mode.
      - Shared Memory Support:  (1) Add logic necessary to handle remapping
        of shared memory on context switches.  (2) Extend virtual/physical
        address conversions to include addresses in shared memory.  (3) Add
        implementation of platform-specific shared memory support.

    * Atmel SAMA5D Drivers:

      - Implement all network ioctls, including the new ioctl to setup PHY
        event notifications.
      - In kernel build with address environment, need logic to map user
        virtual addresses to physical addresses, and vice versa.

    * Atmel SAMA5D Boards:

      - SAMA5D3 Xplained, SAMA5D3-EK, and SAMA5D4-EK:  Convert existing
        board specific PHY interrupt interfaces to use newly defined
        standard interface.
      - SAMA5D4-EK: Add a configuration for testing the kernel build
        configuration.  There are configurations to boot either from an SD
        card or from and in-memory ROMFS file system.
      - SAMA5D4-EK: Add documentation/support for Rev E. board.

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - Ethernet: Modified to support the change to the network ioctl
        signature changes.  Also add support for new ioctl to setup PHY
        event notifications.

    * STMicro STM32 Boards:

      - STM32F4Discovery with STM32F4DIS-BB: Add a network enabled NSH
        configuration for the STM32F4Discovery board with the STM32F4DIS-BB
        base board installed.  Includes support for the microSD card slot on
        the STM32F4DIS-BB base board.

    * TI Tiva Drivers:

      - Add support for the TI CC3200. From Jim Ewing.

    * TI Tiva Boards:

      - Add support for the TI CC3200 Launchpad. From Jim Ewing.

    * C Library:

      - Re-implemented poll() delay using sem_timedwait().

    * Configuration/Build System:

      - Export Target:  In the kernel or protected builds, (1) only the user
        libraries should be exported,  (2) do not copy internal header files
        or build scripts if this is a kernel or protected build, and (3)
        needs to bundle up the user C startup file (crt0), not the kernel
        head object for the kernel and protected builds.
      - Add logic that will permit us to build user libraries with different
        CFLAGS than kernel code.  This is needed because we need the
        -fno-common option when building ELF code to prevent SHN_COMMON
        relocations.

    * Applications:

      - NSH:  Extend the NSH network initialization logic.  There is now an
        option that will create a network monitor thread that will monitor
        the state of the link.  When the link goes down, the code will
        attempt to gracefully put the Ethernet driver in a down state; When
        the link comes back, the code will attempt to bring the network back
        up.
      - ELF Example:  The ELF test/example has been extended so the
        individual ELF test programs can link against the SYSCALL library
        (if it is available) or against the C library to eliminate or
        minimize the need for symbol tables.
      - Change all occurrences of NxConsole to NxTerm.
      - MTDRWB Example:  Add an example to test MTD R/W buffering.
      - OS Test Example:  Add a trivial test of sem_timedwait.

    * Application Configuration/Build System:

      - Import Target:  (1) Add logic that will allow building applications
        against a NuttX export package (vs. the nuttx/ source tree).  (2)
        Add .config file to export package.  (3) Create apps/import.  Create
        apps/import/Make.defs that does things like define CFLAGS; ELF build
        requires -fno-common in CFLAGS. Copy some base logic from
        nuttx/tools/Config.mk to apps/import/Make.defs.  (4) Add
        apps/import/scripts/gnu-elf.ld GCC linker script for ELF import
        builds.
      - All Makefiles:  (1) Add an install target to all makefiles.  For
        the import build, the top-level Makefile now does two passes: (1)
        builds libapp.a, then (2) installs the programs into apps/bin.  (2)
        Add program installation for CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL in all Makefiles
        that build a main().  (3) For kernel build, the object file
        containing main cannot go into library because of name collisions.
        The object file must be handled as a special case in every Makefile.
      - All Built-In Programs:  With kernel build (CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL),
        entry point to all tasks is main(), not some xyz_main().
      - NSH: Several commands must be disabled in the kernel build because
        they depend on interfaces that are not available outside of the
        kernel: dd, df, losetup, mkfatfs, mkdr, and ps.
      - apps/tools/:  (1) Add mkimport.sh to expload an NuttX import package
        and install in apps/import.  (2) Add mkromfsimg.sh  script to create
        a BOOT ROMFS filesystem image.
      - ELF and NxFLAT Examples: Do not build test cases that use
        task_create() if there is an address environment.

    * Tools:

      - refresh.sh: Add a tool to make refreshing configurations easier
        when you want to do a lot of them.
      - mksyscall.c: Build syscalls that do not need header files.
      - mkexport.sh: Add .config file to export package.
      - See above for new apps/tools scripts.

Efforts In Progress.  The following are features that are partially
implemented but present in this release.  They are not likely to be
completed soon.

    * Processes.  Much of the work in this release is focused on the
      realization of Unix-style user processes in NuttX.  There is more to
      be done, however.  The full roadmap and status is available at:
      http://www.nuttx.org/doku.php?id=wiki:nxinternal:memconfigs#the_roadmap_toward_processes

    * XMega:  There are some fragments in place for an XMega port.  That
      port has not really started, however.

    * Galileo:  Similarly, there are fragments in place for an Intel Galileo
      port.  The port not been started in earnest either.

Bugfixes.  Only the most critical bugfixes are listed here (see the ChangeLog for the complete list of bugfixes and for additional, more detailed bugfix information):

    * Core OS:

      - Kernel build fixes: (1) IDLE TCB setup needs to indicate that the
        IDLE thread is a privileged, kernel thread.  (2) Don't build
        task_create() or task_spawn() interfaces if there is an address
        environment.  (3) posix_spawn() kernel proxy thread should be a
        kernel thread, not a user task.
      - Several pthread interfaces: Add const storage class to phthread
        parameters.  From Freddie Chopin.
      - sched/clock: Remove vestiges of g_tickbias;  need, instead, to apply
        time bias to g_basetime in order to provide the correct system time.
      - System Calls:  (1) Several typos fixed; corrected integration of
        exevc(), execvl(), posix_spawn, and posix_spawnp system calls. (2)
        If we are configured to use a kernel stack while in SYSCALL handling,
        then we need to switch back to the user stack to deliver a signal.

    * File Systems/Block Drivers/MTD:

      - procfs: Fix some procfs breakage introduced by reorganizing some
        non-reorganizable data structures.  From Ken Pettit.
      - AT45: In at45db_bwrite , the buffer is not increased when writing
        more than 1 page.  Sourceforge bug #34.

    * Binary Formats:

      - ELF relocations.  Some relocation types do not have a named symbol
        associated with them.  The design did not account for that case.
      - ELF Loader: Critical bugfix.. BSS was not being cleared.

    * Memory Management:

      - Granule allocator initialization uses wrong allocator to setting
        aside kernel memory.
      - Add a flag to group structure:  If the group is created by a kernel
        thread, then all resources in the group must be privileged.

    * Cryptogrphic Support:

      - crypto/cryptodev.c: Path segments reversed in include file path. Noted by Brennan Ashton.

    * Common Drivers:

      - Common CAN upper-half: In can_txdone, waiters on the semaphore
        should be informed regardless of the return value of can_xmit. First
        it returns -EIO if there are no new packets, and second the
        information of the waiters is about the last transferred packet.
        From  Daniel Lazlo Sitzer.

    * ARM:

      - System Calls: Fix a typo in system call when fetching parameter from
        the stack:  regs[REG_PC]+4 is the address, not regs[REG_PC+4].

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - STM32 F401 UART: Correct support for USART6 on this chip.  From
        Freddie Chopin.
      - STM32 FLASH fixes: use size_t instead of uint16_t, make interface
        more generic.  From Freddie Chopin.
      - Fix for UART7 and UART8 on STM32 clock enable from Aton.
      - CAN: At the end of the interrupt handler, the interrupts were being
        disabled, if all packets have been transferred when the interrupt
        handler was invoked. This is problematic, because the interrupt
        handler calls can_txdone of the upper half which can enqueue new
        packets to send. Removed the block altogether, because can_txdone
        calls can_xmit which disables interrupts if there are no new packets
        to send.  From  Daniel Lazlo Sitzer.
      - Additional STM32 CAN correction suggested by Max Holtzberg.

    * STMicro ST32 Boards:

      - configs/mikroe-stm32f4: Fix a few compile bugs and minor corrections
        to the mikroe-stm32f4 configuration source.  From Ken Pettit.

    * ARM9/ARMv7-A:

      - System Calls: Fix ARM7/9 and Cortex-A SYSCALLs:  For threads in SVC
        mode, the SVC instructions clobbers R14.  This must be taken account
        in the inline assembly.
      - Task Setup:  All tasks, even user mode tasks, must start in
        supervisor mode until they get past the start-up trampoline.
      - ARMv7-A:  Modify up_fullcontextrestore() for CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL.
        It changed CPSR while in kernel.  That will crash if the new CPSR is
        user mode while executing in kernel space.  Fixed by adding a
        SYS_context_restore system call.  There is an alternative, simpler
        modification to up_fullcontextrestore() that could have been done:
        It might have been possible to use the SPSR instead of the CPRSR and
        then do an exception return from up_fullcontextrestore().  That
        would be more efficient, but I never tried it.

    * Atmel SAM3/4 Boards:

      - SAM3X/Arduino Due: Fix typo in sam3x_periphclks.h; add SCLK
        definitions to board.h header file.  From Fabien Comte.
      - SAM3 RTT: Only SAM4 family has RTTDIS bit in the MR register.
        SourceForge bug #33 from Fabien Comte.

    * C Library:

      - sscanf(): NuttX libc tried to guess how many characters to parse,
        extracted them into a buffer, then ran strtol() on that buffer.
        That guess was often wrong.  A better approach would be to call
        strtol() directly on the input data, using the endptr return value
        to determine how many characters to skip after parsing.  From Kosma
        Moczek.
      - Corrected atan2 implementations from Denis Arnst.
      - Change to lib_dtoa() to fix precision error from trailing zeroes.
        From Bob Doiron.

    * Applications:

      - Fix NSH PS command:  If there are no arguments, it could print
        garbage for argument list.

    * Configuration/Build System:

      - Null Example:  Need to include config.h it order know if this is or
        is not a kernel build.  This problem still exists in several other
        file that may need to define main().

NuttX-7.6
---------

The 106th release of NuttX, Version 7.6, was made on November 26, 2014,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-7.6.tar.gz and
apps-7.6.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

Additional new features and extended functionality:

    * Core OS:

      - Moved name semaphore and message queue support out of the OS and
        into the VFS.  These improves the architecture by unifying the
        management of named resources, removes redundant resource management
        logic, and makes named semaphores and message queues  visible in the
        file system.  By default, these are visible at /var/lock and
        /var/mqueue.
      - Add SIGPOLL for use as part of the AIO implementation.
      - Remove CONFIG_MAX_TASK_ARGS configuration.  There is now no
        predetermined limit on the number of arguments that may be passed
        to a new task on start-up.

    * Work queues:

      - Add support for priority inheritance on the low priority worker
        queue.  That is, if a higher priority thread has scheduled work, the
        priority of the low priority worker thread(s) will be boost to the
        priority of the queuing thread.  At work is performed at at least
        thread priority of the scheduling thread.  If there are multiple
        worker threads, then all threads get reprioritized.  Currently
        only implemented for AIO.
      - Add support for multiple low-priority work queue threads.  This
        allows individual worker threads to block indefinitely for I/O as
        necessary without halting the entire work queue.

    * VFS/General Drivers:

      - Implement create() (as a macro).
      - Add pread() and pwrite().   Also added pread() and pwrite()
        system calls.
      - AIO: Add aio_read(), aio_write(), aio_return(), aio_error(),
        aio_suspend(), aio_canel(), lio_listio(), and aio_fsync().  This
        logic minimizes the creation of new threads by using the new
        features also added to the low priority work queue with this
        release.  It uses the new low priority worker thread interface
        to adjust the priority of the worker thread according to the
        priority of the AIO client thread
      - Implement standard syslogmask() to control logging (also removing
        the non-standard syslog_enable()).

    * File Systems/Block Drivers/MTD:

      - Extend MTD support to the M25P16. From Sbastien Lorquet.

    * Drivers:

      - BCH (Block-to-Character): Add support for seeking in BCH.  From
        Sbastien Lorquet.

    * Graphics Support/Graphics-Related Drivers:

      - Add support for a generic ILI9341 LCD driver.  From Marco Krahl.
      - Add ANSI/VT100 foreground and background color commands.
      - Add driver for ST7565 LCD that works with NHD-C12864KGZ display.  From Pierre-noel Bouteville.

    * Networking:

      - Verify that multiple networks can be supported.
      - Add support for the case where there are multiple networks:  One
        being Ethernet and the other not (SLIP, PPP, ...).  The primary
        difference from the standpoint of the stack is that (1) ARP may or
        may not be necessary, (2) the size of the link layer header will
        vary, and (3) different MTUs and TCP receive windows may be used
        with each link.  Suggested by Brennan Ashton.
      - Extensions to UDP and TCP connection structures for the case of
        multiple networks.  In this case, assigned port numbers only have to
        be unique with respect to the IP address.  So, for example, you
        could have multiple port 80's, one on each network.

    * Host Simulation:

      - Removed the old, strange up_stdio.c and implemented a simulated UART
        driver to provide the console input.  The new logic starts a
        separate, Linux domain pthread to read the console input in raw mode
        and provides the incoming data to NuttX via standard NuttX domain
        IPCs.
      - Add support for 64-bit longjmp/setjmp in simulator platform.  This
        will permit operation of the simulation natively on a 64-bit
        platform.

    * ARMv7-M:

      - Add ARMv7-M CMSIS ITM header file and library.  From Pierre-noel
        Bouteville.
      - Add ARMv7-M CMSIS DWT and TPI header files. From Pierre-noel
        Bouteville.
      - Add ARMv7-M support to use ITM for SYSLOG debug output. Includes
        logic from Pierre-noel Bouteville.

    * Atmel SAM3/4 Drivers:

      - Add support for SAM3/4 basic serial TERMIOS and flow control.
        There are issues with IFLOW control: PDC or DMAC support is
        required.

    * Atmel SAM3/4 Boards:

      - SAM4E-EK: Add support for PHY interrupt.

    * Atmel SAMA5D Boards:

      - SAMA5D3-Xplained:  Add a configuration that provides a simple test
        for the EMAC and GMAC on the SAMA5D3 working together.
      - SAMA5D4-EK:  Add a configuration that provides a simple test for the
        EMAC0 and EMAC1 on the SAMA5D4 working together.

    * Freescale KL:

      - Add an I2C header file for the Freescale KL family.  From Alan
        Carvalho de Assis.

    * NXP LPC32xx:

      - Add support for tickless operation using the NXP LPC43xx.  From
        Brandon Warhurst.

    * SiLabs EFM32:

      - Add a basic port for the SiLabs EFM32 family.  Includes many files
        contributed by Pierre-noel Bouteville .

    * SiLabs EFM32 Boards:

      - Add board support for the EFM32 Gecko Starter Kit.
      - Add board support for the Olimex EFM32G8809128 STK.  NOTE: I am
        unable to test this configuration due to tool-related issues.
      - Add board support for the SiLbas EFM32GG Giant Gecko Starter kit.

    * STMicro STM32:

      - Add support for the STM32 F411RE from Serg Podtynnyi.
      - Add support for the STM32F103RG.  From Murilo Ponte.

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - STM32 F4:  Add logic that implement true high speed support for the
        STM32 OTGHS peripheral and concurrent support for both LS and HS
        OTG.  New OTGHS drivers provided for both device and host. From
        Brennan Ashton.

    * STMicro STM32 Boards:

      - STM32 Nucleo-F411RE: Extend this board configuration to also support
        the Nucleo-F411RE.  From Serg Podtynnyi.
      - Add support for the STM32F429i Discovery's LCD (SPI based).  From
        Marco Krahl.
      - configs/stm32f100rc_generic:  Removed this generic board configuration.
        I have decided to stop support of generic board configurations.  Generic
        board configurations do not provide support for any specific hardware
        but can be useful only if there are not other examples for the setup
        for a particular architecture. Not the case here.

    * C Library:

      - Add a mostly bogus wchar.h header file.  This file is mostly bogus
        because none of the wide character operations are currently
        supported in the Nuttx C library.  The file does provide the wchar_t
        types needed by some software, however.
      - Add isatty() function. From  Alan Carvalho de Assis.
      - Add mktemp(), mkstemp(), tmpnam() and tempnam().

    * Configuration/Build System:

      - Add a PRELINK macro to Config.mk.  From Kriegleder.
      - compiler.h:  Defines inline functions as not instrumented - this is
        relevant for anyone using instrumentation.  From Lorenz Meier.

    * Applications:

      - apps/interpreter/bas:  Added in the Michael Haardt's BAS 2.4 adapted
        for use by NuttX by Alan Carvalho de Assis.   Includes support for
        VT100 terminals and color commands.
      - Examples:  Added bastest/ which holds a special version of Michael
        Haardt's BAS 2.4 test files adapted for use by NuttX on a ROMFS file
        system.
      - Examples:  Add a simple UDP relay bridge for testing configurations
        with multiple networks.  Includes a host-side test driver for
        testing the bridge.
      - Netutils: Add implementation of timeouts for the netutils webclient.
        From Brennan Ashton
      - NSH: Add support for a custom NSH ROMFS startup image header file
        location.  From Martin Lederhilger.
      - OS test:  Add a simple test of named semaphores.
      - OS test:  Add AIO test case in OS test.

Efforts In Progress.  The following are features that are partially
implemented but present in this release.  They are not likely to be
completed soon.

    * Processes.  Much of the work in this release is focused on the
      realization of Unix-style user processes in NuttX.  There is more to
      be done, however.  The full roadmap and status is available at:
      http://www.nuttx.org/doku.php?id=wiki:nxinternal:memconfigs#the_roadmap_toward_processes

    * XMega:  There are some fragments in place for an XMega port.  That
      port has not really started, however.

    * Galileo:  Similarly, there are fragments in place for an Intel Galileo
      port.  The port not been started in earnest either.

Bugfixes.  Only the most critical bugfixes are listed here (see the
ChangeLog for the complete list of bugfixes and for additional, more
detailed bugfix information):

I ran cppcheck against the entire code base and correct many latent bugs
including things as serious as memory leaks,  two locations where interrupts
were be disabled but never re-enabled, and errors in the Tickless mode of
operation.  My thanks to the developers of cppcheck!  I am impressed!

    * Core OS:

      - vfork():  Now that arguments are kept on the stack, the way that
        arguments are passed from parent to child in vfork() must change.
        This bug has always been present, but was not visible with the
        old strdup() way of passing arguments.
      - vfork() problem: If we get to vfork() via system call, then we
        need to clone some system call information so that the return form
        the cloned system call works correctly.
      - Fixes to tickless operation code, especially in alarm mode.  From
        Brandon Warhurst.
      - Fix an important bug in the watchdog timer creation logic.
      - Calling mq_timedreceived() with immediate timeout was getting stuck
        and not timing out. Immediate timeout is achieved by setting absolute
        timeout value to past time, for example abstime={ .tv_sec=0,
        .tv_nsec=0 }. However absolute time was converted to relative time
        using unsigned integer arithmetic and resulted large ticks count by
        clock_abstime2ticks, instead of expected negative ticks value.
        Change corrects clock_abstime2ticks() to return negative ticks, if
        absolute time is in the past.  From Jussi Kivilinna.

    * Memory Management:

      - Fix a place in the memory manager where it explicitly assumed that
        the size of a pointer is 4 bytes.  That assumption was OK if the
        actual size is smaller but made the heap unstable when used with
        the x86_64 host simulation.
      - Granule Allocator:  If the INTR granule allocator mode is enabled,
        there is no semaphore to destroy.  From Lorenz Meier.

    * Networking:

      - Network routing:  I don't think that the net_route() function has
        ever worked correctly.  The source IP was updated in the match
        struct instead of the route IP.  From Brennan Ashton.
      - Move and rename IP header flag definitions.  The problem fixed here
        is that there IP header flag definitions were not available when TCP
        was disabled.  The IP flags are used in ICMP and IGMP.
      - Network routing:  Refuse to perform routing table lookups for the
        Broadcast IP address.  From Brennan Ashton.
      - Network routing:  Add logic to netdev_findbyaddr() to return the
        correct network device for the case where a broadcast
        address is used.  This change caused trivial ripples through other
        files because additional parameters are required for
        netdev_findbyaddr() when CONFIG_NET_MULTINIC.

    * File Systems/Block Drivers/MTD:

      - NXFFS Dump: Fix problems with redefinitions of fdbg macro.  With the
        fix to the syslog prototype, a LOG priority must now be the first
        parameter.  Fixed by replacing all occurrences of fdbg with
        syslog(LOG_DEBUG, and eliminating the macro redefinitions.  Noted
        by Sebastien Lorquet.
      - poll() was not waking up from signals (for example mq_notify()
        events).  From Jussi Kivilinna.
      - poll():  Add proper handling for sem_timedwait errnos.  From Jussi
        Kivilinna.
      - include/nuttx/fs/fs.h: Fix typo in conditional compilation.  From
        Alan Carvalho de Assis.

    * Graphics/Graphic-Related Drivers:

      - Remove warnings when CONFIG_NXTK_BORDERWIDTH is set to zero.  From
        Pierre-Noel Bouteville.

    * Common Drivers:

      - Make standard syslog and vsyslog POSIX compliant (also modify
        non-standard syslog functions for compatibility).
      - R/W buffering: Fix typo that can cause compilation error.

    * Atmel SAM3/4:

      - SAM4S: Add missing SPI0 clock configuration macro for the SAM4S.  From spasbyspas.

    * Atmel SAM3/4 Drivers:

      - SAM4E-EK: Fix an error in a USART1 pin number.

    * Atmel SAMA5D3/4 Drivers:

      - SAMA5DF4: Fix several typos that will prevented EMAC1 from
        initializing properly.

    * NXP LPC43xx:

      - Fixes to allow compile of lpc43_gpioint.c.  From Brandon Warhurst.

    * STMicro STM32:

      - Add missing ADC pinmap definitions for the STM32 F103R from Martin
        Lederhilger.

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - STM32 EXTI: Correct STM32 RTC EXTI bit definition.  From Lazlo.
      - STM32 IWDG, WWDG, DBGMCU: Fix watchdog stop bit usage.  From Lazlo.
      - STM32 OTGFS: Correct a typo in the STM32 OTGFS register bit definitions.

    * ARM:

      - ARM up_internal.h: Add protection from C++ name mangling in the
        ARM up_internal.h.  From Lorenz Meier.

    * MicroChip PIC32MX:

      - PIC32MX7: DEVCFG0 bit 2 must be set.  Writing bit 2 as zero can
        brick the CPU on some versions.  From Cris Kvist.

    * C Library:

      - The implementation of access() as vararg macro has the issue that
        any function call with the same name (even in a C++ class) will
        match with it and result in a compile error.  Replaced with a small
        function. This resolves the compile issue, and shouldnt have
        negative side effects for users of the function. From Lorenz Meier.
      - The definition of strncpy() is that empty space should be zero-
        filled, the change adds the zero filling (See the POSIX spec here:
        http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/strncpy.html). From
        Lorenz Meier.
      - limits.h:  Remove the definition of INT_FAST32_MIN which is already
        defined in stdint.h (the correct location).  From Lorenz Meier.

    * Applications:

      - apps/: Correct everything under apps to use the corrected syslog
        interfaces.  Remove any non-portable uses of syslog.
      - NSH: Fix ls -l output for regular files.
      - NSH: Fix reversed in/out file closing in DD command when an error
        occurs.  From Ken Pettit.
      - NSH:  Add logic to restart the console wait if an error occurs
        while reading from the console.  In USB console startup, the logic
        must be able to open the USB serial and receive 3 newlines.
        However, it the USB driver is disconnected or otherwise fails before
        the 3 newlines are received, the receive loop becomes a killer,
        infinite loop, CPU hog.  Noted by spasbyspas.
      - Netutils: Fix memcpy of host address in netlib_gethostaddr().  From
        Brennan Ashton.
      - Netutils:  If you make a DNS request before the DNS address it would
        cause an assertion. The state of the IP setting is not something the
        application should be aware of, it should only be concerned with
        whether or not the name was resolved.  From Brennan Ashton.
      - Netutils: Fix md5 hashing when digest[$i] islower that 16. From
        Sergey.
      - Stack Monitor: Fix compile problems introduced when the syslog()
        prototype changed; Also update Makefile for kernel build From
        Radoslaw Adamczyk.
      - Examples: Update NxTerm makefile for kernel-build issues. From
        Radoslaw Adamczyk.
      - Examples: Fixes to keypadtest from Pierre-Noel Bouteville.
      - Examples: These examples all set the IP address of eth1 but the
        netmask and gateway of eth0 if DHCP is enabled:  discover, tcpecho,
        webserver, xmlrpc. That can't be right.

NuttX-7.7
---------

The 107th release of NuttX, Version 7.7, was made on January 26, 2015,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-7.7.tar.gz and
apps-7.7.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

Additional new features and extended functionality:

    * Core OS:

      - Task exit handling:  Add logic to clean up after task_delete() or
        pthread_cancel() if the task happens to be waiting on a semaphore
        when was is cancelled.
      - Stack coloration:  Removed CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK and replaced it with
        CONFIG_STACK_COLORATION that does the same thing but without enabling
        debug.  From David Sidrane.

    * Common Drivers:

      - Discrete joystick driver: Added an interface definition and upper
        half driver for a discrete joystick device (where X/Y changes are
        indicated with button presses).
      - Analog joystick driver: Added an interface definition and upper
        half driver for a analog joystick device (where X/Y positions are
        sampled, numeric values).
      - Add driver support for the ADXL345 accelerometer.  From  Alan
        Carvalho de Assis
      - Generic serial driver:  Add watermark levels to the serial RX flow
        control logic.  Modify the rxflowcontrol method to accept the number
        of bytes in the buffer and a boolean indication of which watermark
        was crossed.

    * File Systems/Block Drivers/MTD:

      - Add procfs write support.  From Ken Petit.
      - Implemented wear-leveling in the SmartFS.  From Ken Pettit.
      - MMC/SD Interface: MMCSD SDIO:  Add support for a new
        SDWAIT_WRCOMPLETE condition.  The previous logic used a busy-wait
        loop to poll the card R1 status to determine when the card was
        ready for the next transfer.  That busy-wait can be quite long --
        up to hundreds of milliseconds.  An alternative is to look the SD D0
        pin which will change state when the card is no longer busy.  This
        change avoids the busy-wait poll by reconfiguring the SD D0 pin as a
        GPIO interrupt, then waiting for the card to become ready without
        taking up CPU cycles. From David Sidrane.

    * Drivers:

      - Add support for a generic EEPROM driver that accesses EEPROM as a
        character driver (vs. an MTD driver).  From Sbastien Lorquet.

    * Graphics Support:

      - Many new fonts converted for use with NuttX and added by
        Pierre-noel Bouteville

    * Networking:

      - IPv4 support is now conditioned on CONFIG_NET_IPv4.
      - Implemented and verified IPv6 support conditioned on
        CONFIG_NET_IPv6.  Either IPv4 or IPv4 or both may be selected.
        Sockets, of course, must be bound to one or the other. Added support
        for IPv6 ioctls to manipulate IP addresses.
      - Integrated support for ICMPv6 and the ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery
        Protocol and ICMPv6 ECHO request/reply needed to support ping logic.
      - All Ethernet drivers:  Modified to support.  Most, however, are
        still missing address filtering logic required for ICMPv6 Neighbor
        Discovery Protocol.  See
        http://www.nuttx.org/doku.php?id=wiki:howtos:ipv6#ethernet_driver_requirements
      - Also added missing raw/packet socket support to all Ethernet drivers.

    * Host Simulation:

      - Add a configuration build and test the Traveler first person game
        using the simulator.
      - Add an X11 mouse-based simulation of an analog joystick device

    * Atmel SAMA5D Boards:

      - Add analog Joystick shield support for the SAMA5D3 Xplained board.

    * Freescale KL Drivers:

      - Add GPIO interrupt capability for the KL architecture. From Alan
        Carvalho de Assis

    * Freescale KL Boards:

      - Freedom-KL25Z: Add board support for the ADXL345 accelerometer. From
        Alan Carvalho de Assis
      - Freedom-KL25Z: Update the Freedom KL25Z board CC3000 support to use
        the current CC300 interfaces.  From Alan Carvalho de Assis

    * NXP LPC43xx Boards:

      - A port of NuttX to the LPC4357-EVB from Toby Duckworth.  This port
        is a leverage of the LPC3330-Xplorer port and still have a some
        misinformation from that port that needs to be updated for the
        LPC4357-EVB.

    * SiLabs EFM32 Drivers:

      - Serial: Add support for serial termios TCGET and TCSET.  For the
        moment, only set/get speed is implemented.  From Pierre-noel
        Bouteville.
      - RMU: Add support for the EFM32 reset management unit (RMU).  From
        Pierre-noel Bouteville.

    * SiLabs EFM32 Boards:

      - Add support for timer/PWM on the EFM32GG.  From Pierre-noel
        Bouteville

    * STMicro STM32:

      - Enable support for the STM32 F102.  From the PX4 team.

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - STM32 F429 LTDC: Add interface to perform hardware accelerated layer
        operation. Provides access to a reference of a specific ltdc layer.
        From Marco Krahl
      - STM32 F429 LTDC support: Implemented LTDC framebuffer support for the
        generic nuttx framebuffer interface. Also implements the interface to
        perform hardware accelerated layer operation by the ltdc controller
        and dma2d controller later. From Marco Krahl.
      - STM32:  Add support for the internal low speed clock (LSI) as a
        source of the RTC clock.  Some  boards do not have the external
        32kKhz oscillator installed, for those boards we must fallback to
        the crummy internal RC clock.  From Kevin Hester
      - STM32 SDIO:  Add support for the new SDWAIT_WRCOMPLETE condition.
        From David Sidrane

    * STMicro STM32 Boards:

      - Add a discrete Joystick support for the STM3210E-EVAL.
      - Add analog Joystick shield support for the Nucleo F4x1RE boards.
      - STM32 F429i-Disco:  Add support for initializing of the ltdc
        controller and the lcd device connected on the stm32f429i-disco.
        From Marco Krahl.
      - Removed the px4-v2_upstream configuration.  This was not the
        official configuration for the PX4 board and has led to confusion
        by NuttX users.  The board configuration also requires some ongoing
        maintenance and customization to support ongoing PX4 testing and
        evaluation.  It is best retained the PX4 repositories where it can
        be properly maintained and not in the upstream NuttX repository.

    * TI Tiva:

       - Add support for the TI Tiva TM4C 129X family.  Some unverified
         support for the TM4C 1294 is also in place.

    * TI Tiva Drivers:

      - Added support for Tiva I2C driver.  Verified on the Tiva TM4C123G
        and TM4C129X.
      - Added a Tiva TM4C129X Ethernet driver.
      - Add a timer library for generic support of Tiva timers
      - Add a driver lower half for drivers/timer.c.  Only 32-bit periodic
        timers are supported.  This provides userspace access to timers.

    * TI Tiva Boards:

      - TM4C123G Launchpad:  Add initialization logic for an external AT24
        EEPROM.  This is intended only to support testing of the Tiva I2C
        driver.
      - Board support for the Tiva DK-TM4C129x Connected Development Kit.
      - DK-TMC129X:  Add an IPv6-enabled NSH configuration.

    * C Library/Header Files:

      - Added support for a variadic ioctl() function.  The ioctl()
        interface is a non-standard, Unix interface.  NuttX has always used
        the older, three-parameter version.  Most contemporary systems now,
        however, use a variadic form of the ioctl() function.  Added an
        option to insert a shim layer to adapt the three-parameter ioctl()
        to use the variadic interface form.  Internally, the ioctl handling
        is the same three-parameter logic.  The only real complexity to the
        shim is in how the system calls must be handled.
      - Added sys/custom_file.h.  Used when CUSTOM_FILE_IO is define and
        avoids  re-definition errors about the FILE define.  From Thomas
        Gruber via the PX4 repository
      - Add CRC8 support to the C library. From Ken Pettit.
      - math.h: Added support for the expm1 functions. From Brennan Ashton

    * Applications:

      - apps/examples/djoystick:  Add a test of the discrete  joystick
        driver.
      - apps/examples/ajoystick:  Add a test of the analog joystick
        driver.
      - apps/examples/ltdc: Add ltdc test example. From Marco Krahl
      - apps/system/lm75:  Add a tiny application to read the temperature
        from an LM-75 (or compatible) temperature sensor
      - apps/examples/timer:  Add a trivial test of the timer driver

      - apps/system/cu: Add a minimalist implementation  of the 'cu'
        terminal program (part of Taylor UUCP for ages). Using it, you can
        simply open a serial port and interact with it. Using '~.' you can
        leave the terminal program and drop back to nsh.  This  might come
        in handy for people that have e.g. GSM modems, GPS receivers or
        other devices with text based serial communications attached to
        their Nuttx systems. From Harald Welte
      - apps/interpreters/micropython:  A port of Micro Python to NuttX.
        Contributed by Dave Marples

      - apps/netutils/dnsclient:  Can select to be either IPv4 or IPv6, but
        not both (IPv6 still does not compile)
      - apps/netutils/netlib:  Add new library functions to manipulate IPv6
        addresses.
      - apps/examples/nettest:  Update test so that it can be used to test
        IPv6 TCP sockets
      - apps/examples/udp:  The UDP test example has been extend to support
        IPv6 domain sockets

      - apps/nshlib:  Add logic to initialize IPv6 addresses
      - apps/nshlib:  Add the ping6 command to support checking IPv6 networks.
      - apps/nshlib: Clean up network status presentation for IPv6

Efforts In Progress.  The following are features that are partially
implemented but present in this release.  They are not likely to be
completed soon.

    * IPv6.  While basic IPv6 support was completed in NuttX-7.7,
      there are lingering issues with getting IPv6 compatibility
      with applications and network utilities.

    * Processes.  Much of the work in this release is focused on the
      realization of Unix-style user processes in NuttX.  There is more to
      be done, however.  The full roadmap and status is available at:
      http://www.nuttx.org/doku.php?id=wiki:nxinternal:memconfigs#the_roadmap_toward_processes

    * XMega:  There are some fragments in place for an XMega port.  That
      port has not really started, however.

    * Galileo:  Similarly, there are fragments in place for an Intel Galileo
      port.  The port probably will not happen (I gave my Galileo board away!).

Bugfixes.  Only the most critical bugfixes are listed here (see the
ChangeLog for the complete list of bugfixes and for additional, more
detailed bugfix information):

    * Core OS:

      - POSIX message queues: msg type should be char * not void * in
        mq_send, mq_timedsend, mq_receive, and mq_timedreceive.  Noted by
        Pierre-Noel Bouteville
      - POSIX message queues: In message queue creation return ENOSPC error
        if size exceeds the configured size of pre-allocated messages; Use
        ENOSPC vs ENOMEM per OpenGroup.org.  From Pierre-Noel Bouteville.
      - Task Names: strncpy() will not copy the terminating \0 into the
        destination if the source is larger than the size of the
        destination. Ensure that the last byte is always zero and let
        strncpy() only copy CONFIG_TASK_NAME_SIZE bytes. The issue of
        unterminated names can be observed in ps when creating a pthread
        while CONFIG_TASK_NAME_SIZE is set to 8.  From  Daniel Willmann

    * Memory Management:

      - Granule allocator: Fixes some issues found by the PX4 team using
        Coverity.  From Pavel Krienko

    * Networking:

      - Several fixes correcting issues with the CC3000 networking.  From
        Jussi  Kivilinna
      - CC3000 Fix: Data can be unaligned.  When dereferenced as an input
        ntosh(), a bad value is returned.  Reported by Alan Carvalho de
        Assis
      - Correct naming of fields in struct sockaddr_in6:  sin6_port and
        sin6_family, not sin_port and sin_family.
      - accept(): Correct the value returned by accept() in the case where
        net_lockingwait() is called.  It was returning -1 and losing the
        errno value.  Noted by Rony Xln

    * Common Drivers:

      - Loop device should return -EINTR is interrupted by a signal.
      - M25P serial flash driver:  Add subsector size of the M24P16 part.
        From Lazlo
      - Common serial driver: In case a thread is doing a blocking operation
        (e.g. read()) on a serial device, while it is being terminated by
        pthread_cancel(), then uart_close() gets called, but the semaphore
        is still blocked. This means that once the serial device is opened
        next time, data will arrive on the serial port (and driver
        interrupts handled as normal), but the received characters never
        arrive in the reader thread.  The problem was fixed by re-
        initializing the semaphores on the last uart_close() on the device.
        From Harald Welte
      - Pipes: Fixes some issues found by the PX4 team using Coverity.  From
        Pavel Krienko
      - CDC/ACM driver: Fixes some issues found by the PX4 team using
        Coverity.  From Pavel Krienko

    * NXP LPC43xx Drivers:

      - LPC4357: Changes required to get USART 2 & 3 working on the
        lpc4357-evb.  From Toby Duckworth.

    * STMicro STM32:

      - Several fixes correcting issues with the STM32 header files from
        Jussi Kivilinna

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - Ported Tridge's STM32 I2C noise resilience logic from the PX4
        repository.
      - STM32 F2 and F4:  Set the GPIO_SPEED_50MHz on all F2 and F4 SPI pin
        configurations.  This is based on an F411 SPI1 errata but the fixed
        is generalized to all SPI and all F2 and F4.  Discovered and fixed
        by Sebastien Lorquet.
      - Fix for STM32 OTGHS device driver working in FS mode.  From Ken
        Pettit.
      - For STM32 OTG HS DEV (in FS mode): Disable ULPI clock enable in RCC
        AHB1 Register.  If Both ULPI and the FS clock enable bits are set in
        FS mode, then the ARM never awakens from WFI due to a chip issue.
        This is only an issue if you are using the internal PHY.  From Ken
        Pettit.
      - STM32 F429 LTDC: Add missing clut register definition. From Marco
        Krahl
      - STM32 serial: fix declaration and definition of up_receive() and
        up_dma_receive() to match fields in the interface definition of
        struct uart_ops_s.  From Freddie Chopin.

    * TI Tiva Drivers:

      - Fix Tiva IRQ control logic; was limited to only 64 IRQs.  That is a
        problem for higher numbered IRQs on many platforms

    * C Library/Header Files:

      - avsprintf():  Fix a bug in usage of va_list on x86.  On x86,
        va_list is a pointer to a single copy on the stack.  avsprintf()
        calls lib_vsprintf() twice and so traverses the va_list twice using
        va_start.  va_start modifies that single copy on the stack so that
        the second call to lib_vsprintf() fails.  This appears to be an
        issue with x86 only so far.
      - stdint.h:  Don't use hex values to specify minimum values of fixed
        width, signed values.  Hex values are inherently unsigned and not
        usable for this purpose in all contexts.
      - strncpy():  Would trash a lot of memory if n == 0.  From Yasuhiro
        Osaki.
      - sscanf().  Accept %X and %F as well as %x %f as a format specifiers.
        From Sbastien Lorquet

    * Applications:

      - apps/examples/romfs: fix romfs example builtin app registry issue.
        From Librae
      - apps/system/cdcacm, composite and usbmsc:  Fix some strangely placed
        conditional compilation.  Looks like an automated update went awry
      - apps/netutils/telnetd:  Add protection when CONFIG_SCHED_HAVE_PARENT
        is enabled:  Call sigaction with SA_NOCLDWAIT so that exit status is
        not retained (no zombies) and block receipt of SIGCHLD so that
        accept is not awakened by a signal.  If accept() is awakened by a
        signal, do not do anything crazy like exit.  Most from Rony Xln
      - apps/nshlib/: NSH TFTP get command:  Wrong file name used for the
        destination.  From Lazlo

NuttX-7.8
---------

The 108th release of NuttX, Version 7.8, was made on February 11, 2015,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-7.8.tar.gz and
apps-7.8.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

This release is primarily a bugfix release for the NuttX-7.7 version that
was release just two weeks prior.  That release included substantial
modifications in the NuttX networking to accommodate support for IPv6.  This
release follows close behind NuttX-7.7 in order to correct some the problems
discovered in that networking code.  This release does, however, include a
small number of new features and bug fixes unrelated to NuttX networking.

Additional new features and extended functionality:

    * Core OS:

      - Tickless Mode:  added limit of maximum delay that can be request
        by the scheduler tickless logic.  This is necessary so that the
        tickless logic does not request a delay beyond the capability of the
        underlying hardware.  From Macs Neklyudov.

    * Common Drivers:

      - VFS Unlink: Add an unlink method to both the character and block
        driver interface.  This is important because if the driver inode is
        unlinked and there are no open references to the driver, then the
        driver resources will be stranded.  On the unlink call, the driver
        has the opportunity (1) check if there an any open references, and
        if not, (2) free the driver resources.
      - Pipes and FIFOs:  Implement the unlink method.  If the pipe/FIFO is
        unlinked, it will marked the pipe/FIFO as unlinked.  If/when all
        open references to the driver are closed, all of the driver
        resources will be freed.
      - Added an option to use the syslog'ing device as the system console.
        This option enables a low-level, write-only console device at
        /dev/console (similar to the low-level UART console device).  From
        Pierre-noel Bouteville.

    * File Systems/Block Drivers/MTD:

      - RAM/ROM disk:  Add logic to dispose of the driver and RAM buffer
        when the RAM disk has been unlinked and all open references to the
        RAM disk have been closed.  Add new parameters to romdisk() to
        specify what should be done with the RAM/ROM buffer in this case --
        Should it be freed or not?  Changed all calls to ramdisk() to use
        these new parameters.

    * Networking:

      - Add support for local, Unix domain sockets.  Support included for
        both SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_DGRAM style local socket.
      - UDP enhancement:  Add UDP read-ahead support.  In addition to
        eliminating the main reason for lost UDP packets, then change
        enables support for for poll/select on UDP sockets and also non-
        blocking UDP sockets.  From Macs Neklyudov.
      - SLIP interface improvements.  From Macs Neklyudov.
      - IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation: Added logic to support verification
        that we have the IPv6 address in the Neighbor Table before sending
        any packets.  If not, then the Neighbor Solicitation message is
        sent.  This feature is important because otherwise the first packet
        sent to a remote peer will fail (it would have been replaced with a
        Neighbor Solicitation).
      - IPv6 Autonomous Auto-Configuration:  Added support for sending
        ICMPv6 Router Solicitation and receiving Router advertisement.  The
        local IPv6 address, mask, and router address are then auto-configured
        from the response..
      - IPv6 Router Support:  Add logic to behave like a router (if so
        configured) only in the sense that NuttX will send the router
        advertisement message in response to any received router solicitation
        messages.  Thus, one NuttX node in a network can configure the IPv6
        addresses of all other nodes in the network.
      - Optional IPv6 address filtering added to all Ethernet drivers for
        the all-routers multicast address.

    * Atmel AVR:

      - Added architecture support for the Atmel AVR ATMega1284P MCU.  From
        Jedi Tek'Unum.

    * Atmel AVR Boards:

      - Added support for the LowPowerLab MoteinoMEGA that is based on the
        Atmel AVR ATMega1284P MCU.  From Jedi Tek'Unum.

    * Atmel SAMA4:

      - Add support for Tickless mode of operation for the SAM4CM platform.
        From Macs Neklyudov.

    * Atmel SAMA4 Drivers:

      - Ethernet: The SAM4E Ethernet driver can now be configuration to
        perform all network processing on the work queue.  This greatly
        reduces the amount of interrupt level processing to service Ethernet
        packets.
      - SAM4E Ethernet: Add support multicast address matching and IPv6.

    * Atmel SAMA4 Boards:

      - SAM4E-EK: The nsh configuration now configures the Ethernet driver
        for execution on the work thread.

    * Atmel SAMA5D Drivers:

      - SAMA5D4 Ethernet: The SAMA5D4 Ethernet driver can now be configuration
        to  perform all network processing on the work queue.  This greatly
        reduces the amount of interrupt level processing to service Ethernet
        packets.
      - SAMA5D3 and SAMA5D4 Ethernet: Add support multicast address matching
        and IPv6.

    * Atmel SAMA5D Boards:

      - SAMA5D4-EK;  Added a configuration to testing IPv6.
      - SAMA5D4-EK:  Converted the nsh and ipv6 configurations to configure
        the Ethernet driver to use the work queue (vs. interrupt level
        processing).

    * Freescale KL:

      - Add architectural support for the K26Z128VLH4 chip.  From Derek B. Noonburg.

    * Freescale KL Boards:

      - Add board support for the Freedom KL26Z board.  From Derek B. Noonburg.

    * NXP LPC17xx Drivers:

      - Ethernet: Add support multicast address matching and IPv6.

    * SiLabs EFM32:

      - Add configurable option to unconditionally enable LE clocking. Even
        you don't use core clock LE as source for LFA or LFB, to read are
        write any register not clocked by HFPERCLK or HFCORECLK,  HFCORECLKLE
        should be enabled.  From Pierre-noel Bouteville.

    * SiLabs EFM32 Drivers:

      - EFM32 RTC:  RTC driver using BURTC. From Pierre-Noel Bouteville.

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - AES: Add driver for STM32L162XX AES peripheral.  From Juha Niskanen.
      - Ethernet: The STM32 Ethernet driver can now be configuration to
        perform all network processing on the work queue.  This greatly
        reduces the amount of interrupt level processing to service Ethernet
        packets.
      - Ethernet: Add support multicast address matching and IPv6.

    * STMicro STM32 Boards:

      - Added an IPv6 configuration for the STM32F4-Discovery board (with the
        STM32-DISCO_BB base board).
      - Converted all STM32F4-Discovery configurations (with base board) to
        configure the Ethernet driver to use the work queue (vs. interrupt
        level processing).

    * TI Tiva Drivers:

      - Added support for TM4C123G timers.  From Calvin Maguranis.
      - Added a Tiva ADC driver.  From Calvin Maguranis.

    * TI Tiva Boards:

      - Added TM4C123G timers on the TM4C123G Launchpad.  From Calvin Maguranis.
      - Added Tiva ADC support to the TM4C123G-Launchpad.  From Calvin Maguranis.

    * C Library/Header Files:

      - Math Library: Added support for inverse hyperbolic functions,
        isfinite(), error functions, nan(), copysign(), and trunc()
        functions.  From Brennan Ashton.

    * Applications:

      - apps/examples/ustream:  Add a simple test of Unix domain stream
        sockets.
      - apps/examples/udgram:  Add a simple test of Unix domain datagram
        sockets.
      - apps/netutils/netlib:  Add utilities to convert to/from prefix
        lengths from/to 128-bit network masks.
      - apps/nshlib: Modify the NSH IPv6 ifconfig command to show the more
        standard post-pended prefix value, rather than the full 128-bit
        netmask.

Efforts In Progress.  The following are features that are partially
implemented but present in this release.  They are not likely to be
completed soon.

    * Processes.  Much of the work in this release is focused on the
      realization of Unix-style user processes in NuttX.  There is more to
      be done, however.  The full roadmap and status is available at:
      http://www.nuttx.org/doku.php?id=wiki:nxinternal:memconfigs#the_roadmap_toward_processes

    * XMega:  There are some fragments in place for an XMega port.  That
      port has not really started, however.

Bugfixes.  Only the most critical bugfixes are listed here (see the
ChangeLog for the complete list of bugfixes and for additional, more
detailed bugfix information):

    * Core OS:

      - Work Queues:  Fix a backward calculation when determining the time
        to the next interesting event. .  From Liio Chen via the PX4
        repository.
      - clock_systimespec():  Fixes for compilation errors in certain
        configurations.  From Macs Neklyudov.

    * Graphics

      - Fixed a problem with one of the font files.  From Pierre-noel Bouteville.

    * Networking:

      - IOB Deadlock: There were issues with the TCP write-ahead buffering
        if CONFIG_NET_NOINTS was enabled:  There is a possibility of
        deadlocks in certain timing conditions:  The network should never
        wait for TCP read-ahead buffering space to be available.  It should
        drop the packets immediately if no buffering is available. This was
        fixed by duplicating most of the IOB interfaces:  The versions that
        waited are still present (like iob_alloc()), but now there are non-
        waiting versions of the same interfaces (like iob_tryalloc()).  The
        TCP read-ahead logic now uses only these non-waiting interfaces.
      - TCP Deadlock: Fix another deadlock when CONFIG_NET_NOINTS is enabled.
        tcp_write_buffer_alloc() calls sem_wait() with network locked.  That
        worked if CONFIG_NET_NOINTS was not defined because interrupts are
        automatically restored when the wait happens.  But with
        CONFIG_NET_NOINTS=y, the wait blocks with the network locked -- bad
        style and also can lead to a deadlock condition.
      - ARP response waiting: Fixes another CONFIG_NET_NOINTS issue.  When
        called sem_timedwait() with the network locked, the network stays
        locked while we wait which is not what we want (without CONFIG_NET_NOINTS,
        interrupts are re-enabled while we wait and all is well).
      - TCP accept():  Fix a major TCP bug introduced with the NuttX-7.7
        IPv6 changes:   Some connection logic was reordered; setting the
        socket as 'connected' got moved to BEFORE the point where the check
        was made if the socket was already connected.  The resulting behavior
        was odd:  Telnet would connect, but then when you exit and reconnect,
        it would fail to connect.  But then if try again, it would connect
        okay. So the symptom was connect-fail-connect-fail-...
      - Lots of build problems introduced into multiple NIC support with the
        IPv6 changes of NuttX-7.7.   Many places where conditional logic based
        on CONFIG_NETDEV_MULTINIC is  confused with CONFIG_NET_MULTILINK.
        Lots of code changed with IPv6 that was never compiled with MULTINIC
        enabled.

    * Common Drivers:

      - Pipes and FIFOs: Fix a race condition between FIFO buffer operations
        and the opening and closing of FIFOs which necessary when the FIFOs
        are used to support Unix domain, datagram sockets.  The default
        policy is the deallocate FIFO buffering when the last client closes
        the pipe.  When when used for datagram communications, packets left
        in the FIFO will be lost. Some like UDP read-ahead is needed:  The
        buffered data in the FIFO needs to be retained until the reader gets
        a chance to re-open the FIFO.  Added an ioctl (PIPEIOC_POLICY) to
        control the buffer policy.  Default (0) is the legacy behavior; Unix
        domain datagram logic sets the alternative policy so that the packet
        data persists after the FIFO is closed.
      - RAMTRON:  Table of parts is not terminated properly if
        CONFIG_RAMTRON_FRAM_NON_JEDEC is not defined.  Noted by David
        Sidrane.

    * All Architectures:

      - Removed all occurrences of up_maskack_irq() that disables interrupts
        with up_ack_irq() that only acknowledges the interrupts.  This is only
        used in interrupt decoding logic.  Also remove the logic that
        unconditionally re-enables interrupts with the interrupt exits.  This
        interferes with the drivers ability to control the interrupt state.
        This is a necessary, sweeping, global change and unfortunately
        impossible to test.

    * ARM

      - ARMv7-A and ARMv7-M memcpy(): Optimized ARM assembly language
        memcpy's were not returning a value in R0 they are required to do.
        From David Sidrane.
      - ARMv7-A interrupt handler should not automatically re-enable interrupts
        on interrupt return.  That interferes with the driver's ability to
        manage interrupts.  Analogous change made to all other architectures
        as well (ARM7, ARM9, HC, SH, x86, z16, z80, etc,.  See above.).

    * STMicro STM32:

      - GPIO Interrupts: Disabling any of EXTI 5-9 interrupts was disabling
        interrupts for all EXTI 5-9. Same issue with EXTI 10-15.  From Jussi
        Kivilinna.

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - RTCC:  Fix for recent changes that caused compilation failrues with
        STM32L15XX configurations.  From Jussi Kivilinna.
      - SPI: The source clock for SPI 4,5, and 6 should be PCLK2, not PCLK1
        (for F411, F427, and F429).  Per David Sidrane.

    * C Library/Header Files:

      - execl():   Fix bad logic in counting the number of arguments.
        execl() parameter passing could never have worked.  Noted by
        Pierre-noel Bouteville.

    * Applications:

      - Fix for building with parallel make. Build-server sometimes failed
        'make -j24' with errors in the builtin line or or sometimes silently
        succeeds but generated builds that contain a random subset of
        configured NuttX applications. There are two root causes for this:
        (1) Recipes for building builtin_list.h and builtin_proto.h are
        not linearizable, and (2) Nothing ensures that 'make context' is run
        first for apps/builtin.  This change address both issues. From Juha
        Niskanen.

NuttX-7.9
---------

The 109th release of NuttX, Version 7.9, was made on April 14, 2015,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-7.9.tar.gz and
apps-7.9.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

Additional new features and extended functionality:

    * Core OS:

      - Assertions: Add support for dumping board-specific information on
        assertions. From David Sidrane.
      - boardctl(): :  Add a new non-standard OS interface called boardctl().
        This is similar to a driver IOCTL call.  But this is an IOCTL call
        directly on the board logic.  This function will eventually replace
        all of the ad hoc OS interfaces that are current used to perform
        application specific initialization and application driver test
        configuration.  It essentially formalizes and institutionalizes
        these rogue interface in to at least a single crazy call.

    * Graphics:

      - Line Joins:  Line drawing graphic functions now take an argument that
        will draw a circular "cap" on the ends of lines to support cleaner
        joining of lines segments..

    * Common Drivers:

      - SPI iInterface:  Add an SPIDEV_USER so that there can be board-
        specific definitions of SPI devices.
      - I2C Interface:  Add a user provided void * argument to the I2C
        callback method for the I2C slave interface.  Suggested by Nate
        Weibley.
      - AT24 EEPROM Driver: Add support for (1) the byte-oriented read()
        method, (2) devices that have extended memory regions, and (3)
        devices that use 8-bit addressing.
      - Freescale MPL115A barometer: Add driver for the Freescale MPL115A
        barometer.  From Alan Carvalho de Assis.
      - CS2100-CP: Add a driver for the CS2100-CP Fractional-N Multipler
        chip.
      - RTC IOCTls:  Added the definitions of a driver based RTC interfaces
        and RTC upper half driver.

    * File Systems/Block Drivers/MTD:

      - umount2():  Added to support un-mount flags. umount() is now a macro
        that just calls umount2() with flags = 0.
      - File system interface: Pass the umount2() flags to every unbind()
        implementation.  That is where the decision to umount or not and how
        to umount will be made.
      - FAT unbind: Add support for umount2(target, MNT_FORCE) in the FAT
        file system.

    * Networking:

      - netdev_register(): Improve the network device registration logic.
        When multiple link types are used, modify how each interface number
        is assigned to the device name by incrementing the device number
        individually for each interface link type.  From Max Neklyudov.
      - Add TUN network device.  Used to support the Netutils PPPD
        implementation. From Max Neklyudov.

    * ARMv7-M

      - ARM Cortex-M7:  Add basic support for the Cortex-M7 architecture.
      - ARMv7 Common Lazy Exception handling. Add common support for lazy
        FPU state saving.  MCU-specific lazy FPU saving was already in place.
        This change just makes the code share-able.

    * Atmel SAMA5D3/4 Drivers:

      - SAMA5 Serial:  Backport support for flowcontrol and termios from
        SAM3/4.

    * Atmel SAMV7:

      - Atmel SAMV7:  Add architecture support for the Atmel SAMV7 family
        (Cortex-M7)

    * Atmel SAMV7 Boards:

      - Atmel SAMV71 Xplained Ultra:  Add board support for this SAMV7 board.
        This initialize release includes support for: SDRAM, TWI/I2C, SPI,
        Ethernet, HSMCI, DMA, GPIOs, UARTs, AT24 EEPROM and the maXTouch
        Xplained Pro LCD.  Drivers are available for SSC/I2C, the WM8904,
        the maXTouch trouchscreen, and USB device but have not yet been
        fully integrated in this release.

    * SiLabs EFM32 Drivers:

      - EFM32 USB Device is now functional with the efforts of From Pierre-
        noel Bouteville.
      - EFM32 I2C:  Add I2C driver.  From Pierre-noel Bouteville.

    * STMicro STM32:

      - STM32F372/F373: Adds architecture support for this STM32 parts.
        Tested on STM32F373CC.  Contributed by  Marten Svanfeldt.

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - STM32 RTCC: Break out a new internal interface, stm32_rtc_setdatetime().
        This eliminates some un-necessary time conversions.  From Freddie Chopin.
      - STM32 RTCC: Add an implementation of the RTC lower half interface
        for the STM32.
      - STM32 RTCC: Extend the RTC interface to support reading subseconds.
        From Jussi Kivilinna.
      - STM32 BBSRAM: Adds the ability to use the STM32F2 and STM32F4 Battery
        Backed SRAM in the file system. With an option to Save Panic context
        to one of the files. From David Sidrane.

    * STMicro STM32 Boards:

      - Olimexino-STM32: Board support for the Olimexino STM32 board from David
        Sidrane.
      - Viewtool-STM32F107:  Add support for an optional, add-on Freescale
        MPL115A baramoter.  From Alan Carvalho de Assis.

    * TI Tiva:

      - TM4C1294:  Add support for the TM4C1294.  Contributed by Frank Sautter.

    * TI Tiva Drivers:

      - Tiva ADC:  Updated files to allow for ADC and PWM triggering by a
        timer.  Refactoring of ADC implementation.  From Calvin Maguranis.
      - Tiva Timer: Refactoring by Calvin Maguranis

    * TI Tiva Boards:

      - TM4C123G-launchpad: Add ADC support.  From Calvin Maguranis.
      - TM4C123G-launchpad: Add board button interrupt support.  From Calvin
        Maguranis.
      - TM4C1294 Launchpad:  Add support for the TM4C1294 Launchpad.
        Contributed by Frank Sautter.

    * Microchip PIC32

      - PIC32MZ:  Add architectural support for the PIC32MZ (MIPS32 M14k).
        Includes contributions from Kristopher Tate.

    * Microchip PIC32MZ Boards

      - PIC32MZ Starter Kit: Add basic board support for the PIC32MZ.
        Includes contributions from David Sidrane.

    * C Library/Header Files:

      - gettimeofday():  This function is no longer a core OS interface.  It
        is only a wrapper around clock_settime().
      - settimeofday(): Added. gettimeofday has been deprecated in POSIX
        2008. settimeofday() was never part of POSIX, but I decided to add
        it to libc as well just for symmetry.
      - Day-of-Week: Add CONFIG_TIME_EXTENDED to support the last 3 members
        of the tm struct and support for filling them in with the day of the
        week. From David Sidrane.
      - sighold(), sigrelse(), sigignore(), sigset() and sigpause():  New
        signal handling functions.
      - sys/select.h: Extend the fd_set type definition so that it can
        handle more than 32 descriptors (if so configured).  From Max
        Neklyudov.
      - netdb.h:  Add a mostly-commented-out version of the standard netdb.h
        header file.
      - include/nuttx/board.h:  Remove common board function prototypes from
        other files and consolidate them in this new header file.

    * Applications:

      - OS test: Improved error checking for sem_timedwait() from Juha
        Niskanen.
      - OS test: Add a simple test of sigprocmask, sighold, and sigrelse.
      - PPPD test:  Add PPPD test case.  Split out from the PPPD daemon by
        Brennan Ashton.
      - Netutils: Add a PPP daemon.  From Max Neklyudov.
      - NSH:  NSH initialization now calls boardctl(BOARDIOC_INIT) instead
        of nsh_archinitialize().   Remove support for CONFIG_NSH_ARCHMAC.
        It is not used and there are better ways to do that operation.
      - NSH:  Allow NSH 'date' command with no hardware RTC.  This command
        is useful without an RTC too.  Also, this permits testing on the
        simulator which never has an RTC.
      - apps/examples/:  Several tests changed (touchscreen adc, pwm,
        graphics).  No longer call directly into the OS, but rather
        indirectly via boardctl().
      - Modbus: Includes extensions to support RTU master mode by
        Armink(383016632@qq.com): https://github.com/armink/FreeModbus_Slave-Master-RTT-STM32.
        Ported to NuttX by Darcy Gong.
      - TZ database:  All logic to build timezone database needed for
        localtime() support.  Does not do much else yet.

Efforts In Progress.  The following are features that are partially
implemented but present in this release.  They are not likely to be
completed soon.

    * Processes.  Much of the work in this release is focused on the
      realization of Unix-style user processes in NuttX.  There is more to
      be done, however.  The full roadmap and status is available at:
      http://www.nuttx.org/doku.php?id=wiki:nxinternal:memconfigs#the_roadmap_toward_processes

    * XMega:  There are some fragments in place for an XMega port.  That
      port has not really started, however.

Bugfixes.  Only the most critical bugfixes are listed here (see the
ChangeLog for the complete list of bugfixes and for additional, more
detailed bugfix information):

    * Core OS:

      - atexit(): Fix compile failure due to reference to undefined variable
        in certain configurations.  From Juha Niskanen.
      - syscalls: Last changes to message queue prototypes did not make it
        into call gate logic.  Some additional errors had crept as well since
        the system calls are seldom used.
      - waitpid(): Do not use uninitialized boolean in waitpid().  From Juha
        Niskanen.
      - Timing functions:  Fix some nanosecond comparisons.  Comparisons should
        be greater than OR EQUAL TO 1000000000 for maximum value of nanoseconds
        in struct tm.  From Juha Niskanen.
      - Time initialization: Fix an error in time initialization when there
        is no RTC and the time is initialized from a fixed configured value.
        The call to clock_calendar2utc() was returning the time in units of
        seconds.  The initialization logic, however, was expecting to get
        time in units of days.  This problem has been there forever but
        obviously has not significant impact to behavior in systems where
        time is not visible.
      - mq_timedsend():  Should not check for valid time if there is space
        in the message queue.  Noted by Freddie Chopin.
      - select() and sem_timedwait(): Fix places where the errno value was
        being overwritten by subsequent actions so that the returned errno
        value was incorrect.  From Max Neklyudov.
      - clock_systimer64(): Fix a problem in clock_systimer64 that occurs
        when (1) the 64-bit system time is enabled, and (2) the value of
        CONFIG_USEC_PER_TICK is less than 1 milliseconds (such as when using
        the tickless mode of operation).  In that case, the conversion of
        time to 64-bit millisecond value in clock_systmer64() causes some
        bad times to be returned.  Time was converted to milliseconds, then
        to configured ticks.  Precision was lost in the millisecond
        conversion. The fix is to first convert time to a 64-bit microsecond
        value, then to the configured tick value. Noted by David Sidrane.
      - clock_systimespec():  When an RTC is used clock_systimespec() must
        subtract the basetime from the returned time.  It needs to return
        the time since power up, no the current time.  Issue noted by Max
        Neklyudov.
      - AIO: correct some backward tests in aio_read() and aio_write():
        Socket descriptors have higher numbers than file descriptors.  In
        aio_contain(),  Copy u.ptr (void *) when initializing aioc and not
        the case specific u.aioc_filep.  From Michal Ulianko.

    * File Systems/Block Drivers/MTD:

      - procfs:  Fix potential NULL pointer dereference of 'node'.  From
        Juha Niskanen.
      - FAT: fat_unbind() was accessing 'fs->fs_sem' after freeing the 'fs'
        struct. From Juha Niskanen.
      - mkfatfs:  Use DMA memory for mkfatfs when needed. This makes mkfatfs
        use fat_dma_alloc() when CONFIG_FAT_DMAMEMORY is set. This is needed
        to ensure mkfatfs operates with boards that use DMA for microSD.
        From Andrew Tridgell via the PX4/NuttX repository.
      - FAT unmount: Fix a bug in the FAT unbind() logic.  There were
        problems with the way certain internal list handling was
        implemented. The end result is that newly opened or cloned file
        structures were never being added to the list of open files.  So
        when the unmount() happens, it always looked like there were not
        open files and a crash could ensue.
      - FAT mounting:  Fix misthink when CONFIG_ENDIAN_BIG=y.  From Lwazi Dube.

    * Common Drivers:

      - CAN upper half driver: Some lines had to be reordered in the can_open
        function otherwise the open count will only be incremented from 0 to
        1. This caused problems when trying to open the can bus from two
        different tasks. SourceForge Patch #46.

    * Crypto:

      - crypto:  Fix issues when AES support was added for the STM32L1.
        From Juha Niskanen.

    * Networking:

      - Network initialization: Divide net_intiialize() into net_setup() and
        net_initialize() to solve a chicken-and-egg problem.  net_setup()
        must be called before up_initialize() is called so that networking
        data structures are ready to register new network devices.
        net_initialize() now does only timer related operations and is
        called AFTER up_initialize() where the timers are configured.
        Problem noted by Max Neklyudov.
      - netdev_unregister():  Fix a list handling error.  From Max Neklyudov.
      - Socket dup: Do not call sockfd_socket() twice.  From Juha Niskanen.

    * Common Drivers:

      - max11802 touchscreen:  Fix possible unmatched IRQ restore (not
        normally a problem, but could happen in certain configurations).
        Noted by Juha Niskanen.
      - MMCSD SPI Multi-block transfers: ACMD23 must be preceded with CMD55
        command as any other ACMD commands. Also, after the block reading
        wait loop must be inserted before writing the next block of data to
        the sd card.  From Dmitry Nikolaev via Jussi Kivilinna.
      - MMCSD SDIO:  Fix some bad logic when file system debug is turned on:
        Arguments to syslog were missing so that garbage was being printed.
      - Common upper-half serial driver: Report correct number of bytes free
        in serial buffer with FIONWRITE.  From Sami Pelkonen via Jussi Kivilinna.
      - Pipes/Fifos: Fix zero-lenth writes to pipes/FIFOs. From Jussi Kivilinna.
      - USB device MSC: Add NULL pointer check.  From Juha Niskanen.
      - BCH driver: Avoid NULL pointer dereference when bch->refs  == 255.
        From Juha Niskanen.
      - Various drivers: The inode unlink method should not be support if
        operations on the root pseudo-filesystem are disabled.

    * ARMv7-M

      - ARMv7M MPU:  Bad syntax in ARMv7-M MPU logic would cause failure to
        write the correct value to the MPU_RASR register. From Juha Niskanen.

    * Atmel SAM3/4 Drivers:

      - SAM3/4 Serial TERMIOS:  A side-effect of changing serial settings
        via TERMIOS (such as tcsetattr) is that serial interrupts were being
        left disabled.  This is not a problem if the serial configuration is
        changed when there are no open references to the serial device.  In
        that case, serial interrupts are disabled and will not be enabled
        enabled until the serial device is first opened.  But it is fatal if
        the serial device is already opened and if there is a task waiting
        to receive data.  In that case, the side-effect of disabling
        interrupts is fatal:  That task is then left hanging with interrupts
        disabled.
      - SAM3/4 Serial: The IMR register is read-only.  This means that
        sam_restoreints() did not actually re-enable UART interrupts
        (Fortunately, that function was not being used up to this point).
      - SAMA5 HSMCI:  Fix a bug in SAMA5 HSMCI.  The bitfield mask and shift
        values were reversed resulting in a trashed value for the number of
        blocks in the BLOCKR register.  This was sufficient to prevent DMA
        writes from working.

    * Atmel SAMA5 Drivers:

      - SAMA5 Timer/Counter: Fix typos in timer/counter header file.  From
        Bob Doiron.

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - STM32 PWR and RTC: Changes to support fully write protecting the
        backup domain. N.B. stm32_pwr_enablebkp did not account for the delay
        from enable to the domain being writable. The KISS solution is a
        up_udelay. A more complex solution would be a negated write test
        with restore.  From David Sidrane.
      - STM32 SPI:  Add missing SPI callback functions to the STM32 SPI
        driver.  From Freddie Chopin.
      - STM32 I2C: Add missing NULL check.  From Juha Niskanen.
      - STM32 USB device: Fix stale initialization invalidating later NULL
        check.  From Juha Niskanen.
      - STM32 UART: Fix RX DMA setup for UART5.  From  Jussi Kivilinna.
      - STM32 UART: Make input hardware flow-control work with RX DMA.  From
        Jussi Kivilinna.
      - STM32 RTC and clock control:  The STM32F4Discovery board doesn't
        come with a Low speed external oscillator so the default LSE source
        for the RTC doesn't work. In stm32_rtcc.c the up_rtcinitialize()
        logic doesn't work with the LSI. The check on RTC_MAGIC on the BK0R
        register lead to rtc_setup() call that rightfully enables the LSI
        clock; but the next times, when the rtc is already setup, the
        rtc_resume() call does NOT start the LSI clock! The right place to
        put LSE/LSI initialisation is inside stm32_stdclockconfig() in
        stm32fxxxxx_rcc.c.  Doing this I checked the possible uses of the
        LSI and the LSE sources: the LSI can be used for RTC and/or the
        IWDG, while the LSE only for the RTC (and to output the MCO1 pin).
        This change is not verifed for any other platforms.  From Leo
        Aloe3132

    * Tiva Drivers:

      - Tiva GPIO driver needed small fixes in the configuration routines and
        discovered false-positive bugs in interrupt testing: interrupts are
        now verified to actually be working reliably. From Calvin Maguranis .

    * MIPS32:

      - mips32/Toolchain.mk: Current Pinguino toolchain uses the prefix p32-
        instead of mips-.

    * C Library/Header Files:

      - sigaddset() and sigdelset(): Need to set errno if a bad signal
        number is received.
      - sfrtime():  Missing implementation of %C in sfrtime() C (was being
        treated as %y).  From Freddie Chopin.
      - pthread.h: Fix PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER.
      - ungetc.c: Fix NULL pointer dereference in ungetc() if 'stream' was
        NULL, 'stream->fs_oflags' was evaluated.  From Juha Niskanen.
      - Fixes to asinh(), atanh(), and sinh():  The 'basic' expansions all
        exhibited bad cancellation errors near zero (<= 1E-10). This can be
        easily seen e.g. with x = 1E-30, the results are all zero though they
        should be extremely close to x. The cutoff values (1E-5, 1E-9) are
        chosen so that the next term in the Taylor series is negligible (for
        double). Functions could maybe be optimized to use only first term (x)
        and a smaller cutoff, just bigger than where the cancellation occurs
      - localtime(): Inconsistent configuration name: CONFIG_LIBC_TZDIR vs
        CONFIG_LIBC_TZ_TZDIR.  Former wins.

    * Applications:

      - Modbus:  Fix some compile problems when TCP is enabled.

NuttX-7.10
----------

The 110th release of NuttX, Version 7.10, was made on June 9, 2015,
and is available for download from the SourceForge website.  Note
that release consists of two tarballs:  nuttx-7.10.tar.gz and
apps-7.10.tar.gz.  Both may be needed (see the top-level nuttx/README.txt
file for build information).

Additional new features and extended functionality:

    * Binary Loader:

      - ARMv-7M, binfmt/, STM32: Add support uClibc++ exceptions.  This
        involved additional handling for relative relation types, additional
        support for unwinding, as well as additional changes.  The
        culmination of a big effort from Leo Aloe3132.

    * Graphics/Graphic Drivers:

      - RA8875 LCD driver contributed by Marten Svanfeldt.

    * File Systems/Block Drivers/MTD:

      - Union File System: Add support for a union file system that can be
        used to overlay and merge the content of two mounted file systems.

    * USB Host:

      - USB Hub Support: Bring in USB hub-related files from
        https://github.com/kaushalparikh/nuttx.  This is the work of Kaushal
        Parikh.  This is quite a bit more hub logic was needed in before the
        USB hub support was fully functional.  This involved changing many
        USB host controller driver interfaces and modifications to many
        drivers.
      - USB host CDC/ACM class driver:  Added initial implementation of a
        host-side CDC/ACM driver.  Initial version was a great learning
        experience, but probably should be partially redesigned (as
        discussed in the top-level TODO file).
      - IPv6 Routing: Complete implementation of the IPv6 routing logic.
        From Max Neklyudov.

    * Networking:

      - Local Sockets: Add poll support for Unix stream sockets.  From Jussi
        Kivilinna.
      - net/: ARP, ICMP, ICMPv6, PKT, TCP, and UDP now all receive event
        notifications from both network device packet processing, but now
        also from Device-specific events such as when the network goes down.
        The device notification callback structure is now supports dual
        linkages so that the client can receive notifications from both
        source; The device structure now includes a list of clients that
        want to receive device related notifications.  This prevents network
        actions from hanging when the device goes down and will be an
        essential part of future support for removable network devices.
        Some of the core logic was contributed by Max Neklyudov.
      - TUN: Misc. improvements to the TUN driver, mostly related to poll().
        Also several bugfixes. From Max Neklyudov.

    * Simulation Platform:

      - Simulator: Add logic to test localtime and TZ database.  See
        apps/system/README.txt for info.
      - Simulation:  Add a configuration for testing the Union File System.

    * Calypso:

      - Calypso Compal-E86: Updates for execution out of FLASH on the C139
        phone.  From Craig Comstock.

    * Atmel SAMD/L:

      - SAML21 Support: And chip definitions, configuration framework,
        memory map and pin configuration files for SAML21 support.

    * Atmel SAMD/L Boards:

      - SAML21-Xplained:  Add a board support for the SAML21 Xplained Pro.
        This is based on the similar SAMD20 Xplained Pro board.

    * Freescale/NXP KL:
  
      - KL25Z64: Added support for the KL25Z64.  The KL25Z64 is a lower
        memory variant of the KL25Z128 and is used on the Teensy LC.  From
        Michael as SourceForge patch 50.

    * Freescale/NXP KL Boards:
  
      - Teensy-LC: Add board support for the Teensy LC board.  Support is
        based off the Freedom KL25Z board.  LED, PWM, and UART0 have been
        tested. The SPI pins are mapped correctly but have not yet been
        tested.  From Michael Hope as SourceForge patch 51.

    * NXP LPC111x:
    
      - LPC111x:  Support for the LPC11xx family (the LPC1115 MCU in
        particular).  Contributed by Alan Carvalho de Assis.

    * NXP LPC111x Boards:
    
      - LPCXpresso LPC1115:  Support for the LPCXpression LPC1115
        board.  Contributed by Alan Carvalho de Assis.

    * NXP LPC17xx Drivers:

      - LPC17xx Ethernet: Add support for the Micrel KSZ8041 PHY to the
        LPC17xx Ethernet driver.

        board.

    * Atmel SAM3/4 Drivers:

      - SAM4CM:  Add support for optical mode for the SAM4CM UART1.  From
        Max Neklyudov.

    * Freescale (NXP) Kinetis:

      - Kinetis K20: Basic support for the Kinetis K20 architecture.  Taken
        from PX4.  This is the work of Jakob Odersky.

    * Atmel SAMV7 Boards:

      - SAMV71-Xplained w/maXTouch Xplained Pro:  A TWIHS fix was the last
        barrier to getting the touchscreen working in the maXTouch Xplained
        Pro LCD.  Added the NxWM integrated graphics demonstration
        configuration.

    * STMicro STM32:

      - STM32: Added support for STM32F302K8 and STM32F302K6.  From Ben Dyer
        via PX4/David Sidrane.
      - STM32F205RG: Add basic support for the STM32F205RG.  From SourceForge
        Ticket 40 (anonymous, 2015-05-31).
      - STM32 F3:  Add DBGMCU register definitions for the F3 family.  From
        Greg Meiste.

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - STM32 LCDC: Defined a second interface for the dma2d controller.
        LTDC only controls the display visibility but the DMA2D controller
        changes the content of the frame buffer (buffer of the layer). From
        Marco Krahl.
      - STM32 PVD: Added support for STM32's Programmable Voltage Detector
        (PVD) feature. By Dmitry Nikolaev, submitted by Juha Niskanen.

    * STMicro STM32 Boards:

      - STM32F429i-Disco: Add support for the new DMA2D features to the LTDC
        configuration.  From Marco Krahl.

    * TI Tiva Boards:

      - TM4C1294 Launchpad:  Added TM4C1294NCPDT EN0_LED2 (10/100-Base-Tx);
        removed all booster pack pin definitions. From Frank Sautter.

    * C Library/Header Files:

      - libc:  Add an option to disable support for long long formats in
        lib_vsprintf().  On very tiny platforms, this reduces the footprint
        by omitting large libgcc.a libraries to perform the 64-bit
        arithmetic operations. From Alan Carvalho de Assis.

    * Applications: apps/system:

      - apps/system/zoneinfo:  Add logic to build a ROMFS file system
        containing the timezone data.

    * Applications: apps/nshlib:

      - Add poll support for Unix stream sockets.  From Jussi Kivilinna.
      - Enhancements to NSH ifconfig for case of multi-link operation, TUN
        device and local connections.  From Max Neklyudov.
      - Enhanced output to NSH ping command from Max Neklyudov.
      - The NSH mount command now recognizes the Union filesystem type when
        listing mounted file systems.

    * Applications: apps/netutils:

      - apps/netutils/thttpd/ and apps/examples/thttpd/: Add support for
        using binfs/ with the Union FS instead of NXFLAT.  NXFLAT is
        probably the better solution but recently compiler changes make it
        unusable.  binfs or ELF are fallback binary formats.  This commit
        adds an option to use binfs with the Union FS.

    * Applications: apps/examples:

      - Modify/simpify apps/examples build files.  From Roman Saveljev.
      - apps/examples/ltdc:  Add testing support for the STM32 LTDC's 2D DMA.
        From Marco Krahl.
      - apps/examples/ostest: Add a test of nested signals.  There are no
        failures to handle signals but neither am I getting any nested signal
        handling.
      - apps/examples/elf: Add configuration options to support building the
        hello++4 example that depends upon having uClibc++ available.  Also
        add hello++5 to the ELF example  From  Leo aloe3132.
      - apps/examples/unionfs: Add a test of the union file system to
        apps/examples.

Efforts In Progress.  The following are features that are partially
implemented but present in this release.  They are not likely to be
completed soon.

    * Processes.  Much of the work in this release is focused on the
      realization of Unix-style user processes in NuttX.  There is more to
      be done, however.  The full roadmap and status is available at:
      http://www.nuttx.org/doku.php?id=wiki:nxinternal:memconfigs#the_roadmap_toward_processes

    * XMega:  There are some fragments in place for an XMega port.  That
      port has not really started, however.

Bugfixes.  Only the most critical bugfixes are listed here (see the
ChangeLog for the complete list of bugfixes and for additional, more
detailed bugfix information):

    * Core OS:

      - boardctl():  Add missing case causing that caused failures of PWM
        test.
      - pthread_kill(): Re-implemented pthread_kill().  It was just a simple
        wrapper around kill() but since the correct dispatching of signals
        for multi-threaded task groups has been implemented, calling kill()
        does not do what pthread_kill() is supposed to do.  The corrected
        implementation of pthread_kill() will direct the signal specifically
        to the specific pthread and no other.
      - uint32_t callbacks: Update the type passed to watchdog timer
        handlers.  Using uint32_t is a problem for 64-bit machines because
        it it too small to pass a pointer.  uintptr_t is a more appropriate
        type.
      - mq_timedreceive(): move the location where the errno value is set;
        the ETIMEDOUT errno setting was being overwritten by subsequent
        actions before returning.  Noted by Freddie Chopin.
      - POSIX message queues:  Move mq_setattr() and mq_getattr() from
        nuttx/libc/mqueue to nuttx/sched/mqueue.  Also add syscall support
        for mq_setattr() and mq_getattr().  This is necessary in protected
        and kernel builds because in those cases the message queue
        structure is protected and cannot be accessed directly from user
        mode code.  Noted by Jouko Holopainen.

    * File Systems/Block Drivers/MTD:

      - MTD:  Increase the size of the fields in the geometry structure
        (again) to support larger FLASH sizes.  Needed by Sebastien Lorquet.

    * Common Drivers:

      - poll(): Fix resource leak and memory corruption on poll failure.
        From Jussi Kivilinna.

    * USB Host:

      - LPC31xx and SAMA5Dx EHCI:  Fix cache related problem in LPC31 and
        SAMA5Dx EHCI drivers. All buffers are now aligned with the cache
        line size in both starting address and in length.  This cause major
        problems in unlucky builds where the USB host buffers where
        unaligned and abutting other data. The cache flush and invalidate
        operations could be subverted by accesses to adjacent data or could
        have unexpected side effects.  This bug has been in the ECHI drivers
        forever, but was only revealed due to unlucky memory allocations
        during the integration of the hub feature.

    * USB Device:

      - All USB device class drivers:  There needs to be a check to make
        sure that the size of a returned string does not exceed the size of
        the allocated request buffer.  Strings such as vendor names or
        product names will be truncated to fit in the request buffer.

    * Networking:

      - TCP:  Correct failures in long Telnet sessions by increasing th
        size of the number of bytes sent from uint16_t to uint32_t.  This
        avoids an integer overflow that causes a long Telnet session to be
        closed unexpectedly.  From Rony XLN.
      - Network locks: Correct some network lock logic:  Two error
        conditions where the network was not being unlocked and one where it
        was getting unlocked twice.  From Jussi Kivilinna.
      - Local Sockets: Local stream sockets had problem of double releasing
        pipes (both server and client attempt release), which causes wrong
        pipe pair being closed in multi-client case. Solve by adding per
        connection instance ID to pipe names.  From  Jussi Kivilinna.
      - TCP:  Fix an important TCP networking bug: 16-bit flags was being
        converted to 8-bits in a few locations, causing loss of status
        indications.
      - TCP: net_startmonitor() always returned OK.  In the race case
        where a socket has already been closed, it correctly handled the
        disconnection event but still returned OK.  Returning OK caused the
        callers of net_startmonitor() to assume that the connection was
        okay, undoing the good things that net_startmonitor() did and
        causing the socket to be incorrectly marked as connected.  This
        behavior was noted by Pelle Windestam.
      - setsockopt() failed when setting timeouts to values less tha 100
        msec.  That is because the timeout is limited to stops of 1
        decisecond and because the conversion of structure timeval was
        truncating the microsecond remainder.  The utility
        net_timeval2dsec() now accepts and option to determine how it
        handles the remainder:  truncate, discarding the remainder, use
        the remainder to round to the closed decisecond value, or use any
        non-zero remainder to the next larger whole decisecond value.  Bug
        discovered by Librae.
      - TCP: In the TCP connection operation, it was trying to setup the
        network monitor BEFORE the socket was successfully connected.  This,
        of course, has ALWAYS failed because the socket is not yet connected
        and the TCP state is not yet correct for a connected socket.  However,
        because of other changes net_startmonitor() now returns a failure
        condition that causes worse problems when trying to connect.  The fix
        is to move the logic that starts the network monitor to AFTER the
        socket has been successfully connected.

    * Atmel SAM3/4 Drivers:

      - SAM4CM and SAMA5D Free-running timer: Logic that samples the free
        running counter reads the pending interrupt status register and can
        cause interrupts to be lost.  So, if when the status register is
        read, the logic must also handle the timer overflow event. Found
        and fixed by Max Neklyudov.

    * Atmel SAMA5 Drivers:

      - SAM3/4 Serial:  When reconfigured, serial does not receive bytes
        from UART.  This happens because RX interrupt was disabled in the
        setup routine.  Fixed this I save interrupt configuration before
        UART shutdown and restore it after.  From Max Neklyudov.

    * NXP LPC17xx Drivers:

      - LPC176x GPIO:  Reorder steps when an output GPIO is configured in
        order to avoid transient bad values from being output.  From Hal
        Glenn.
      - LPC17 USB OHCI:  Correct some initialization of data structures.
        When hub support is enabled, it would overwrite the end of an array
        and clobber some OS data structures.
      - LPC17xx Ethernet:  Review, update, and modify the Ethernet driver so 
        that it works better with CONFIG_NET_NOINTS=y.  Also, update all
        LPC17xx networking configurations so that they have
        CONFIG_NET_NOTINTS=y selected.

    * SiLabs EMF32 Drivers:

      - EFM32 SPI: Add missing SPI GPIO pin initialization.  From Pierre-noel
        Bouteville.

    * STMicro STM32:

      - STM32 F3:  Added missing EXTI definitions for the STM32 F3; Correct
        an error the port D base address in the STM32 F30x and F37x memory
        maps.  From Greg Meiste.

    * STMicro STM32 Drivers:

      - STM23 RTC: Fix an error introduced into stm32_pwr_enablebkp().
        That function must preserve the previous state of backup domain
        access on return.
      - STM32 RTC counter: Now need to enable backup domain write access
        when setting the time.  From Darcy Gong.
      - STM32 OTG FS and HS: Added protection in the event that out-of-bound
        endpoint numbers are received.  From David Sidrane.

    * STMicro STM32 Boards:

      - STM32F429i Disco: (1) Fix a bad return value if the LCD driver is
        already initialized. (2) The LCD driver initialization is now
        performed during the early boot sequence.  (3) Increased the size
        of the message queue from 32 to 64 in the lcd configuration.  From
        Marco Krahl.

    * TI Tiva

      - Fixes for Tiva TM4C1294NCPDT.  From Frank Sautter.

      - SAMV7 TWIHS: Fix SAMV TWIHS logic that performs multi-message
        transfers with and without repeated starts.

    * Atmel SAMA5D3/4 Dirvers:

      - SAMA5 CAN: Fix SAMA5 CAN frame construction.  From Max Holtzberg.

    * C Library/Header Files:

      - stdlib.h:  MAX_RAND should be RAND_MAX.
      - assert.h: Wrap definitions of assertion macros in do while so that
        they are valid C statements.  Numerous places throughout the code
        where semicolons were missing at the end of an assertion also had to
        be fixed. Suggested by orbitalfox.
      - inetntoa(): Correct errors in printing IP address when type char is
        signed and the value is >= 128.  From Max Neklyudov.

    * Tools:

      - Tools: Fix test for the existence of the apps/ directory in
        configure.c. Fix backward interpretation of options, -l was selecting
        Windows and -w was selecting Linux. This was SourceForege Ticket #39.

    * Applications: apps/nshlib:

      - apps/nshlib/nsh_timcmds.c: Check return values from time functions.
      - apps/nshlib/: Fix handling of gmtime_r return value in time commands.
        gmtime_r returns a pointer, not an int.

        compile error when CONFIG_NX_XYINPUT=y.  From Librae.
      - apps/examples: When boardctl() fails, need to print errno not the
        returned value which will always be -1.
      - apps/examples: Correct use of the BOARDIOC_GRAPHICS_SETUP boardctl()
        call.
