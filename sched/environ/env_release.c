 * Name: env_release
 *
 * Description:
 *   env_release() is called only from group_leave() when the last member of
 *   a task group exits.  The env_release() function clears the environment
 *   of all name-value pairs and sets the value of the external variable
 *   environ to NULL.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   group - Identifies the task group containing the environment structure
 *           to be released.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   Not called from an interrupt handler
 *
