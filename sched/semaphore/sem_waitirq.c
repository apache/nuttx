 * Name: nxsem_wait_irq
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is called when either:
 *
 *   1. A signal is received by a task that is waiting on a semaphore.
 *      According to the POSIX spec, "...the calling thread shall not return
 *      from the call to [nxsem_wait] until it either locks the semaphore or
 *      the call is interrupted by a signal."
 *   2. From logic associated with sem_timedwait().  This function is called
 *      when the timeout elapses without receiving the semaphore.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   wtcb    - A pointer to the TCB of the task that is waiting on a
 *             semphaphore, but has received a signal or timeout instead.
 *   errcode - EINTR if the semaphore wait was awakened by a signal;
 *             ETIMEDOUT if awakened by a timeout
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *
