 * Name: nxsem_post
 *
 * Description:
 *   When a kernel thread has finished with a semaphore, it will call
 *   nxsem_post().  This function unlocks the semaphore referenced by sem
 *   by performing the semaphore unlock operation on that semaphore.
 *
 *   If the semaphore value resulting from this operation is positive, then
 *   no tasks were blocked waiting for the semaphore to become unlocked; the
 *   semaphore is simply incremented.
 *
 *   If the value of the semaphore resulting from this operation is zero,
 *   then one of the tasks blocked waiting for the semaphore shall be
 *   allowed to return successfully from its call to nxsem_wait().
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   sem - Semaphore descriptor
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This is an internal OS interface and should not be used by applications.
 *   It follows the NuttX internal error return policy:  Zero (OK) is
 *   returned on success.  A negated errno value is returned on failure.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   This function may be called from an interrupt handler.
 *
