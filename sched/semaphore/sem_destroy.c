 * Name: nxsem_destroy
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is used to destroy the un-named semaphore indicated by
 *   'sem'.  Only a semaphore that was created using nxsem_init() may be
 *   destroyed using nxsem_destroy(); the effect of calling nxsem_destroy()
 *   with a named semaphore is undefined.  The effect of subsequent use of
 *   the semaphore sem is undefined until sem is re-initialized by another
 *   call to nxsem_init().
 *
 *   The effect of destroying a semaphore upon which other processes are
 *   currently blocked is undefined.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   sem - Semaphore to be destroyed.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This is an internal OS interface and should not be used by applications.
 *   It follows the NuttX internal error return policy:  Zero (OK) is
 *   returned on success.  A negated errno value is returned on failure.
