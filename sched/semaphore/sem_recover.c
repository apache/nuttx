 * Name: nxsem_recover
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is called from nxtask_recover() when a task is deleted via
 *   task_delete() or via pthread_cancel().  It current only checks on the
 *   case where a task is waiting for semaphore at the time that is was
 *   killed.
 *
 *   REVISIT:  A more complete implementation would release counts on all
 *   semaphores held by the thread.  That would, however, require some
 *   significant extension to the semaphore data structures because given
 *   only the task, there is not mechanism to traverse all of the semaphores
 *   with counts held by the task.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   tcb - The TCB of the terminated task or thread
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   This function is called from task deletion logic in a safe context.
 *

  /* The task is being deleted.  If it is waiting for a semaphore, then
   * increment the count on the semaphores.  This logic is almost identical
   * to what you see in nxsem_wait_irq() except that no attempt is made to
   * restart the exiting task.
   *
   * NOTE:  In the case that the task is waiting we can assume: (1) That the
   * task state is TSTATE_WAIT_SEM and (2) that the 'waitsem' in the TCB is
   * non-null.  If we get here via pthread_cancel() or via task_delete(),
   * then the task state should be preserved; it will be altered in other
   * cases but in those cases waitsem should be NULL anyway (but we do not
   * enforce that here).
