/****************************************************************************
 * Name: nxsem_wait
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function attempts to lock the semaphore referenced by 'sem'.  If
 *   the semaphore value is (<=) zero, then the calling task will not return
 *   until it successfully acquires the lock.
 *
 *   This is an internal OS interface.  It is functionally equivalent to
 *   sem_wait except that:
 *
 *   - It is not a cancellation point, and
 *   - It does not modify the errno value.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   sem - Semaphore descriptor.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This is an internal OS interface and should not be used by applications.
 *   It follows the NuttX internal error return policy:  Zero (OK) is
 *   returned on success.  A negated errno value is returned on failure.
 *   Possible returned errors:
 *
 *   - EINVAL:  Invalid attempt to get the semaphore
 *   - EINTR:   The wait was interrupted by the receipt of a signal.
 *
