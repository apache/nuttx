 * Name: nxsem_reset
 *
 * Description:
 *   Reset a semaphore count to a specific value.  This is similar to part
 *   of the operation of nxsem_init().  But nxsem_reset() may need to wake up
 *   tasks waiting on a count.  This kind of operation is sometimes required
 *   within the OS (only) for certain error handling conditions.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   sem   - Semaphore descriptor to be reset
 *   count - The requested semaphore count
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This is an internal OS interface, not available to applications, and
 *   hence follows the NuttX internal error return policy:  Zero (OK) is
 *   returned on success.  A negated errno value is returned on failure.
 *
