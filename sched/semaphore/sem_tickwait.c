 * Name: nxsem_tickwait
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is a lighter weight version of sem_timedwait().  It is
 *   non-standard and intended only for use within the RTOS.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   sem     - Semaphore object
 *   start   - The system time that the delay is relative to.  If the
 *             current time is not the same as the start time, then the
 *             delay will be adjust so that the end time will be the same
 *             in any event.
 *   delay   - Ticks to wait from the start time until the semaphore is
 *             posted.  If ticks is zero, then this function is equivalent
 *             to nxsem_trywait().
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This is an internal OS interface, not available to applications, and
 *   hence follows the NuttX internal error return policy:  Zero (OK) is
 *   returned on success.  A negated errno value is returned on failure.
 *   -ETIMEDOUT is returned on the timeout condition.
 *

 * Description:

 *   start   - The system time that the delay is relative to.  If the
 *             current time is not the same as the start time, then the

 *             in any event.
 *   delay   - Ticks to wait from the start time until the semaphore is
 *             posted.  If ticks is zero, then this function is equivalent
 *             to sem_trywait().
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This is an internal OS interface, not available to applications, and
 *   hence follows the NuttX internal error return policy:  Zero (OK) is
 *   returned on success.  A negated errno value is returned on failure:
 *
 *     -ETIMEDOUT is returned on the timeout condition.
 *     -ECANCELED may be returned if the thread is canceled while waiting.
