 * Name: group_addrenv
 *
 * Description:
 *   Instantiate the group address environment for the current thread at the
 *   the head of the ready to run list.
 *
 *   This function is called from platform-specific code after any context
 *   switch (i.e., after any change in the thread at the head of the
 *   ready-to-run list).  This function will change the address environment
 *   if the new thread is part of a different task group.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   tcb - The TCB of thread that needs an address environment.  This should
 *         be the TCB at the head of the ready-to-run list, but that is not
 *         enough.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success.  A negated errno value is returned on
 *   any failure.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   This function should only be called within critical OS sections with
 *   interrupts disabled.  Interrupts are disabled internally just to be
 *   certain, however.
 *
