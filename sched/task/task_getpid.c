 * Name: getpid
 *
 * Description:
 *   Get the task ID of the currently executing task.
 *
 * Input parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Normally when called from user applications, getpid() will return the
 *   task ID of the currently executing task, that is, the task at the head
 *   of the ready-to-run list.  There is no specification for any errors
 *   returned from getpid().
 *
 *   getpid(), however, may be called from within the OS in some cases.
 *   There are certain situations during context switching when the OS data
 *   structures are in flux and where the current task at the head of the
 *   ready-to-run task list is not actually running.  In that case,
 *   getpid() will return the error: -ESRCH
 *

   *    empty!  In this case, of course, the CPU0 start-up/IDLE thread with
   *    pid == 0 must be running, and
   * 2. As described above, during certain context-switching conditions the
   *    task at the head of the ready-to-run list may not actually be
