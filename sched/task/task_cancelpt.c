 * Cancellation Points.
 *
 * Cancellation points shall occur when a thread is executing the following
 * functions:
 *
 * accept()          mq_timedsend()           putpmsg()       sigtimedwait()
 * aio_suspend()     msgrcv()                 pwrite()        sigwait()
 * clock_nanosleep() msgsnd()                 read()          sigwaitinfo()
 * close()           msync()                  readv()         sleep()
 * connect()         nanosleep()              recv()          system()
 * creat()           open()                   recvfrom()      tcdrain()
 * fcntl()           pause()                  recvmsg()       usleep()
 * fdatasync()       poll()                   select()        wait()
 * fsync()           pread()                  sem_timedwait() waitid()
 * getmsg()          pselect()                sem_wait()      waitpid()
 * getpmsg()         pthread_cond_timedwait() send()          write()
 * lockf()           pthread_cond_wait()      sendmsg()       writev()
 * mq_receive()      pthread_join()           sendto()
 * mq_send()         pthread_testcancel()     sigpause()
 * mq_timedreceive() putmsg()                 sigsuspend()
 *
 * Each of the above function must call enter_cancellation_point() on entry
 * in order to establish the cancellation point and
 * leave_cancellation_point() on exit.  These functions are described below.

 * Name: nxnotify_cancellation
 *
 * Description:
 *   Called by task_delete() or pthread_cancel() if the cancellation occurs
 *   while we the thread is within the cancellation point.  This logic
 *   behaves much like sending a signal:  It will cause waiting threads
 *   to wake up and terminated with ECANCELED.  A call to
 *   leave_cancellation_point() would then follow, causing the thread to
 *   exit.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Indicate whether the notification delivery to the target
