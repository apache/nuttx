 * Name: nxtask_setup_vfork
 *
 * Description:
 *   The vfork() function has the same effect as fork(), except that the
 *   behavior is undefined if the process created by vfork() either modifies
 *   any data other than a variable of type pid_t used to store the return
 *   value from vfork(), or returns from the function in which vfork() was
 *   called, or calls any other function before successfully calling _exit()
 *   or one of the exec family of functions.
 *
 *   This function provides one step in the overall vfork() sequence:  It
 *   Allocates and initializes the child task's TCB.  The overall sequence
 *   is:
 *
 *   1) User code calls vfork().  vfork() is provided in
 *      architecture-specific code.
 *   2) vfork()and calls nxtask_setup_vfork().
 *   3) nxtask_setup_vfork() allocates and configures the child task's TCB.
 *      This consists of:
 *      - Allocation of the child task's TCB.
 *      - Initialization of file descriptors and streams
 *      - Configuration of environment variables
 *      - Allocate and initialize the stack
 *      - Setup the input parameters for the task.
 *      - Initialization of the TCB (including call to up_initial_state())
 *   4) up_vfork() provides any additional operating context. up_vfork must:
 *      - Initialize special values in any CPU registers that were not
 *        already configured by up_initial_state()
 *   5) up_vfork() then calls nxtask_start_vfork()
 *   6) nxtask_start_vfork() then executes the child thread.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   retaddr - Return address
 *   argsize - Location to return the argument size
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Upon successful completion, nxtask_setup_vfork() returns a pointer to
 *   newly allocated and initialized child task's TCB.  NULL is returned
 *   on any failure and the errno is set appropriately.
