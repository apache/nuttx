	default n
	depends on ARCH_HAVE_TICKLESS
	---help---
		By default, system time is driven by a periodic timer interrupt.  An
		alternative configurations is a tick-less configuration in which
		there is no periodic timer interrupt.  Instead an interval timer is
		used to schedule the next OS time event.  This option selects that
		tick-less OS option.  If the tick-less OS is selected, then there are
		additional platform specific interfaces that must be provided as
		defined in include/nuttx/arch.h

if SCHED_TICKLESS

config SCHED_TICKLESS_TICK_ARGUMENT
	bool "Scheduler use tick argument"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables use of tick argument in scheduler. If enabled, then the
		board-specific logic must provide the following functions:

			int up_timer_gettick(FAR clock_t *ticks);

		If SCHED_TICKLESS_ALARM is enabled, then these additional interfaces are
		expected:

			int up_alarm_tick_cancel(FAR clock_t *ticks);
			int up_alarm_tick_start(clock_t ticks);

		Otherwise, these additional interfaces are expected:

			int up_timer_tick_cancel(FAR clock_t *ticks);
			int up_timer_tick_start(FAR clock_t ticks);

config SCHED_TICKLESS_ALARM
	bool "Tickless alarm"
	default n
	---help---
		The tickless option can be supported either via a simple interval
		timer (plus elapsed time) or via an alarm.  The interval timer allows
		programming events to occur after an interval.  With the alarm,
		you can set a time in the future and get an event when that alarm
		goes off.  This option selects the use of an alarm.

		The advantage of an alarm is that it avoids some small timing
		errors; the advantage of the use of the interval timer is that
		the hardware requirement may be less.

config SCHED_TICKLESS_LIMIT_MAX_SLEEP
	bool "Max sleep period (in microseconds)"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables use of the g_oneshot_maxticks variable. This variable is
		initialized by platform-specific logic at runtime to the maximum
		delay that the timer can wait (in configured clock ticks).  The
		RTOS tickless logic will then limit all requested delays to this
		value.

endif

config USEC_PER_TICK
	int "System timer tick period (microseconds)"
	default 10000 if !SCHED_TICKLESS
	default 100 if SCHED_TICKLESS
	---help---
		In the "normal" configuration where system time is provided by a
		periodic timer interrupt, the default system timer is expected to
		run at 100Hz or USEC_PER_TICK=10000.  This setting must be defined
		to inform of NuttX the interval that the processor hardware is
		providing system timer interrupts to the OS.

		If SCHED_TICKLESS is selected, then there are no system timer
		interrupts.  In this case, USEC_PER_TICK does not control any timer
		rates.  Rather, it only determines the resolution of time reported
		by clock_systime_ticks() and the resolution of times that can be set for
		certain delays including watchdog timers and delayed work.  In this
		case there is a trade-off:  It is better to have the USEC_PER_TICK as
		low as possible for higher timing resolution.  However, the time
		is currently held in 'unsigned int' on some systems, this may be
		16-bits but on most contemporary systems it will be 32-bits.  In
		either case, smaller values of USEC_PER_TICK will reduce the range
		of values that delays that can be represented.  So the trade-off is
		between range and resolution (you could also modify the code to use
		a 64-bit value if you really want both).

		The default, 100 microseconds, will provide for a range of delays
		up to 120 hours.

		This value should never be less than the underlying resolution of
		the timer.  Error may ensue.

if !SCHED_TICKLESS

config SYSTEMTICK_EXTCLK
	bool "Use external clock"
	default n
	depends on ARCH_HAVE_EXTCLK
	---help---
		Use external clock for system tick. When enabled, the platform-specific
		logic must start its own timer interrupt to make periodic calls to the
		nxsched_process_timer() or the functions called within. The purpose is
		to move the scheduling off the processor clock to allow entering low
		power states that would disable that clock.

config SYSTEMTICK_HOOK
	bool "System timer hook"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable a call to a user-provided, board-level function on each timer
		tick.  This permits custom actions that may be performed on each
		timer tick.  The form of the user-provided function is:

			void board_timerhook(void);

		(prototyped in include/nuttx/board.h).

endif # !SCHED_TICKLESS

config SYSTEM_TIME64
	bool "64-bit system clock"
	default n
	---help---
		The system timer is incremented at the rate determined by
		USEC_PER_TICK, typically at 100Hz. The count at any given time is
		then the "uptime" in units of system timer ticks.  By default, the
		system time is 32-bits wide.  Those defaults provide a range of about
		497 days which is probably a sufficient range for "uptime".

		However, if the system timer rate is significantly higher than 100Hz
		and/or if a very long "uptime" is required, then this option can be
		selected to support a 64-bit wide timer.

			void arch_sporadic_start(FAR struct tcb_s *tcb);
			void arch_sporadic_lowpriority(FAR struct tcb_s *tcb);
			void arch_sporadic_suspend(FAR struct tcb_s *tcb);

		Specifies the maximum size of a task name to save in the TCB.
		Useful if scheduler instrumentation is selected.  Set to zero to
		disable.  Excludes the NUL terminator; the actual allocated size
		will be TASK_NAME_SIZE + 1.  The default of 31 then results in

config SCHED_HAVE_PARENT
	bool "Support parent/child task relationships"
	default n
	---help---
		Remember the ID of the parent task when a new child task is
		created.  This support enables some additional features (such as
		SIGCHLD) and modifies the behavior of other interfaces.  For
		example, it makes waitpid() more standards complete by restricting
		the waited-for tasks to the children of the caller. Default:
		disabled.

config SCHED_CHILD_STATUS
	bool "Retain child exit status"
	default n
	depends on SCHED_HAVE_PARENT
	---help---
		If this option is selected, then the exit status of the child task
		will be retained after the child task exits.  This option should be
		selected if you require knowledge of a child process's exit status.
		Without this setting, wait(), waitpid() or waitid() may fail.  For
		example, if you do:

		1) Start child task
		2) Wait for exit status (using wait(), waitpid(), or waitid()).

		This can fail because the child task may run to completion before
		the wait begins.  There is a non-standard work-around in this case:
		The above sequence will work if you disable pre-emption using
		sched_lock() prior to starting the child task, then re-enable pre-
		emption with sched_unlock() after the wait completes.  This works
		because the child task is not permitted to run until the wait is in
		place.

		The standard solution would be to enable SCHED_CHILD_STATUS.  In
		this case the exit status of the child task is retained after the
		child exits and the wait will successful obtain the child task's
		exit status whether it is called before the child task exits or not.

		Warning:  If you enable this feature, then your application must
		either (1) take responsibility for reaping the child status with wait(),
		waitpid(), or waitid(), or (2) suppress retention of child status.
		If you do not reap the child status, then you have a memory leak and
		your system will eventually fail.

		Retention of child status can be suppressed on the parent using logic like:

			struct sigaction sa;

			sa.sa_handler = SIG_IGN;
			sa.sa_flags = SA_NOCLDWAIT;
			int ret = sigaction(SIGCHLD, &sa, NULL);

if SCHED_CHILD_STATUS

config PREALLOC_CHILDSTATUS
	int "Number of pre-allocated child status"
	default 0
	---help---
		To prevent runaway child status allocations and to improve
		allocation performance, child task exit status structures are pre-
		allocated when the system boots.  This setting determines the number
		of child status structures that will be pre-allocated.

		However, the number of child status structures may need to be
		significantly larger because this number includes the maximum number
		of tasks that are running PLUS the number of tasks that have exit'ed
		without having their exit status reaped (via wait(), waitid(), or
		waitpid()).

		Obviously, if tasks spawn children indefinitely and never have the
		exit status reaped, then you may have a memory leak!  If you enable
		the SCHED_CHILD_STATUS feature, then your application must take
		responsibility for either (1) reaping the child status with wait(),
		waitpid(), or waitid() or it must (2) suppress retention of child
		status.  Otherwise, your system will eventually fail.

		Retention of child status can be suppressed on the parent using logic like:

			struct sigaction sa;

			sa.sa_handler = SIG_IGN;
			sa.sa_flags = SA_NOCLDWAIT;
			int ret = sigaction(SIGCHLD, &sa, NULL);

	---help---
		The CPU load measurements are determined by sampling the active
		tasks periodically at the occurrence to a timer expiration.  By
		default, the system clock is used to do that sampling.

		There is a serious issue for the accuracy of measurements if the
		system clock is used, however.  NuttX threads are often started at
		the time of the system timer expiration.  Others may be stopped at
		the time of the system timer expiration (if round-robin time-slicing
		is enabled).  Such thread behavior occurs synchronously with the
		system timer and, hence, is not randomly sampled.  As a consequence,
		the CPU load attributed to these threads that run synchronously with
		they system timer may be grossly in error.

		The solution is to use some other clock that runs at a different
		rate and has timer expirations that are asynchronous with the
		system timer.  Then truly accurate load measurements can be
		achieved.  This option enables use of such an "external" clock.  The
		implementation of the clock must be provided by platform-specific
		logic; that platform-specific logic must call the system function
		nxsched_process_cpuload_ticks() at each timer expiration with interrupts

		interrupt handlers.  If the high-priority worker thread is disabled,
		then that clean up will be performed either by (1) the low-priority
		worker thread, if enabled, and if not (2) the IDLE thread instead
		(which runs at the lowest of priority and may not be appropriate if
		memory reclamation is of high priority)

		For other, less-critical asynchronous or delayed process, the
		low-priority worker thread is recommended.

		CAUTION: Some drivers may use the work queue to serialize
		operations.  They may also use the high-priority work queue if it is
		available.  If there are multiple high-priority worker threads, then
		this can result in the loss of that serialization.  There may be

		For lower priority, application oriented worker thread support,
		please consider enabling the lower priority work queue.  The lower
		priority work queue runs at a lower priority, of course, but has
		the added advantage that it supports "priority inheritance" (if
		PRIORITY_INHERITANCE is also selected):  The priority of the lower

		This options is required to support, for example, I/O operations
		that stall waiting for input.  If there is only a single thread,
		then the entire low-priority queue processing stalls in such cases.
		Such behavior is necessary to support asynchronous I/O, AIO (for

		CAUTION: Some drivers may use the work queue to serialize

config SCHED_LPWORKPRIORITY
	int "Low priority worker thread priority"
	default 100
	---help---
		The minimum execution priority of the lower priority worker thread.

		The lower priority worker thread is intended support application-
		oriented functions.  The lower priority work queue runs at a lower
		priority, of course, but has the added advantage that it supports
		"priority inheritance" (if PRIORITY_INHERITANCE is also selected):
		The priority of the lower priority worker thread can then be
		adjusted to match the highest priority client.  Default: 100

		NOTE: This priority inheritance feature is not automatic.  The
		lower priority worker thread will always a fixed priority unless
		you implement logic that calls lpwork_boostpriority() to raise the
		priority of the lower priority worker thread (typically called
		before scheduling the work) and then call the matching
		lpwork_restorepriority() when the work is completed (typically
		called within the work handler at the completion of the work).
		Currently, only the NuttX asynchronous I/O logic uses this dynamic
		prioritization feature.

		The higher priority worker thread, on the other hand, is intended
		to serve as the "bottom" half for device drivers.  As a consequence
		it must run at a very high, fixed priority.  Typically, it should
		be the highest priority thread in your system.

		The maximum execution priority of the lower priority worker thread.

		The lower priority worker thread is intended support application-
		oriented functions.  The lower priority work queue runs at a lower
		priority, of course, but has the added advantage that it supports
		"priority inheritance" (if PRIORITY_INHERITANCE is also selected):
		The priority of the lower priority worker thread can then be

		it must run at a very high, fixed priority.  Typically, it should
		be the highest priority thread in your system.

		This value provides an upper limit on the priority of the lower
		priority worker thread.  This would be necessary, for example, if
		the higher priority worker thread were to defer work to the lower
		priority thread.  Clearly, in such a case, you would want to limit
		the maximum priority of the lower priority work thread.  Default:
		176
