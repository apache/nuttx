 * Description:
 *   Cancel previously queued work.  This removes work from the work queue.

 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   qid    - The work queue ID
 *   work   - The previously queue work structure to cancel
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) on success, a negated errno on failure.  This error may be
 *   reported:
 *
 *   -ENOENT - There is no such work queued.
 *   -EINVAL - An invalid work queue was specified
