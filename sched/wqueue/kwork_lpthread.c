 * Name: work_lpthread

 * Description:
 *   These are the worker thread(s) that performs the actions placed on the
 *   low priority work queue.
 *
 *   These, along with the higher priority worker thread are the kernel mode
 *   work queues (also build in the flat build).  One of these threads also
 *   performs periodic garbage collection (that would otherwise be performed
 *   by the idle thread if CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE is not defined).  That will
 *   be the lower priority worker thread if it is available.
 *
 *   All kernel mode worker threads are started by the OS during normal
 *   bring up.  This entry point is referenced by OS internally and should
 *   not be accessed by application logic.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   argc, argv (not used)
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Does not return
