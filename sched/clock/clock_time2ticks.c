 * Name: clock_time2ticks
 *
 * Description:
 *   Convert a timespec delay to system timer ticks.  This function is
 *   suitable for calculating relative time delays and does not depend on
 *   the other clock_* logic.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   reltime - Convert this relative time to system clock ticks.
 *   ticks - Return the converted number of ticks here.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Always returns OK
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *
