/****************************************************************************
 * Name: pthread_join
 *
 * Description:
 *    A thread can await termination of another thread and retrieve the
 *    return value of the thread.
 *
 *    The caller's task/thread must belong to the same "task group" as the
 *    pthread is (or was) a member of.  The thread may or may not still
 *    be running.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   thread
 *   pexit_value
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   0 if successful.  Otherwise, one of the following error codes:
 *
 *   EINVAL  The value specified by thread does not refer to joinable
 *           thread.
 *   ESRCH   No thread could be found corresponding to that specified by the
 *           given thread ID.
 *   EDEADLK A deadlock was detected or the value of thread specifies the
 *           calling thread.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *
