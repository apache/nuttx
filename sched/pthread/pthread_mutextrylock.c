 * Name: pthread_mutex_trylock
 *
 * Description:
 *   The function pthread_mutex_trylock() is identical to pthread_mutex_lock()
 *   except that if the mutex object referenced by mutex is currently locked
 *   (by any thread, including the current thread), the call returns
 *   immediately with the errno EBUSY.
 *
 *   If a signal is delivered to a thread waiting for a mutex, upon return
 *   from the signal handler the thread resumes waiting for the mutex as if
 *   it was not interrupted.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   mutex - A reference to the mutex to be locked.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   0 on success or an errno value on failure.  Note that the errno EINTR
 *   is never returned by pthread_mutex_trylock().
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *
 * POSIX Compatibility:
 *   - This implementation does not return EAGAIN when the mutex could not be
 *     acquired because the maximum number of recursive locks for mutex has
 *     been exceeded.
 *
