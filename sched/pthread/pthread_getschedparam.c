 * Name: pthread_getschedparam
 *
 * Description:
 *   The pthread_getschedparam() functions will get the scheduling policy and
 *   parameters of threads. For SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR, the only required
 *   member of the sched_param structure is the priority sched_priority.
 *
 *   The pthread_getschedparam() function will retrieve the scheduling
 *   policy and scheduling parameters for the thread whose thread ID is
 *   given by 'thread' and will store those values in 'policy' and 'param',
 *   respectively. The priority value returned from pthread_getschedparam()
 *   will be the value specified by the most recent pthread_setschedparam(),
 *   pthread_setschedprio(), or pthread_create() call affecting the target
 *   thread. It will not reflect any temporary adjustments to its priority
 *   (such as might result of any priority inheritance, for example).
 *
 *   The policy parameter may have the value SCHED_FIFO, or SCHED_RR
 *   (SCHED_OTHER and SCHED_SPORADIC, in particular, are not supported).
 *   The SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR policies will have a single scheduling
 *   parameter, sched_priority.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   thread - The ID of thread whose scheduling parameters will be queried.
 *   policy - The location to store the thread's scheduling policy.
 *   param  - The location to store the thread's priority.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   0 if successful.  Otherwise, the error code ESRCH if the value specified
 *   by thread does not refer to an existing thread.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *
