 * Name: pthread_setschedparam
 *
 * Description:
 *   The pthread_setschedparam() functions will set the scheduling policy
 *   and parameters of threads. For SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR, the only
 *   required member of the sched_param structure is the priority
 *   sched_priority.
 *
 *   The pthread_setschedparam() function will set the scheduling policy
 *   and associated scheduling parameters for the thread whose thread ID
 *   is given by 'thread' to the policy and associated parameters provided
 *   in 'policy' and 'param', respectively.
 *
 *   The policy parameter may have the value SCHED_FIFO, or SCHED_RR
 *   (SCHED_OTHER and SCHED_SPORADIC, in particular, are not supported).
 *   The SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR policies will have a single scheduling
 *   parameter, sched_priority.
 *
 *   If the pthread_setschedparam() function fails, the scheduling parameters
 *   will not be changed for the target thread.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   thread - The ID of thread whose scheduling parameters will be modified.
 *   policy - The new scheduling policy of the thread.  Either SCHED_FIFO or
 *            SCHED_RR. SCHED_OTHER and SCHED_SPORADIC are not supported.
 *   param  - Provides the new priority of the thread.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   0 if successful.  Otherwise, an error code identifying the cause of the
 *   failure:
 *
 *   EINVAL  The value specified by 'policy' or one of the scheduling
 *           parameters associated with the scheduling policy 'policy' is
 *           invalid.
 *   ENOTSUP An attempt was made to set the policy or scheduling parameters
 *           to an unsupported value (SCHED_OTHER and SCHED_SPORADIC in
 *           particular are not supported)
 *   EPERM   The caller does not have the appropriate permission to set either
 *           the scheduling parameters or the scheduling policy of the
 *           specified thread. Or, the implementation does not allow the
 *           application to modify one of the parameters to the value
 *           specified.
 *   ESRCH   The value specified by thread does not refer to a existing thread.
