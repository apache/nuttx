 * Name: pthread_mutex_consistent
 *
 * Description:
 *   If mutex is a robust mutex in an inconsistent state, the
 *   pthread_mutex_consistent() function can be used to mark the state
 *   protected by the mutex referenced by mutex as consistent again.
 *
 *   If an owner of a robust mutex terminates while holding the mutex, the
 *   mutex becomes inconsistent and the next thread that acquires the mutex
 *   lock will be notified of the state by the return value EOWNERDEAD.
 *   In this case, the mutex does not become normally usable again until the
 *   state is marked consistent.
 *
 *   If the thread which acquired the mutex lock with the return value
 *   EOWNERDEAD terminates before calling either pthread_mutex_consistent()
 *   or pthread_mutex_unlock(), the next thread that acquires the mutex lock
 *   will be notified about the state of the mutex by the return value
 *   EOWNERDEAD.
 *
 *   The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the mutex argument
 *   to pthread_mutex_consistent() does not refer to an initialized mutex.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   mutex -- a reference to the mutex to be made consistent
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Upon successful completion, the pthread_mutex_consistent() function
 *   will return zero. Otherwise, an error value will be returned to
 *   indicate the error.
 *
