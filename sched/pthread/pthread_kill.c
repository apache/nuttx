 * Name: pthread_kill
 *
 * Description:
 *   The pthread_kill() system call can be used to send any signal to a
 *   thread.  See nxsig_kill() for further information as this is just a
 *   simple wrapper around the nxsig_kill() function.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   thread - The id of the thread to receive the signal. Only positive,
 *     non-zero values of 'thread' are supported.
 *   signo - The signal number to send.  If 'signo' is zero, no signal is
 *    sent, but all error checking is performed.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *    On success the signal was send and zero is returned. On error one
 *    of the following error numbers is returned.
 *
 *    EINVAL An invalid signal was specified.
 *    EPERM  The thread does not have permission to send the
 *           signal to the target thread.
 *    ESRCH  No thread could be found corresponding to that
 *           specified by the given thread ID
 *    ENOSYS Do not support sending signals to process groups.
 *
