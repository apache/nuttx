 *   invoke it (if 'execute' is non-zero).
 *
 *   The pthread_cleanup_push() function will push the specified cancellation
 *   cleanup handler routine onto the calling thread's cancellation cleanup
 *   stack. The cancellation cleanup handler will be popped from the
 *   cancellation cleanup stack and invoked with the argument arg when:
 *
 *   - The thread exits (that is, calls pthread_exit()).
 *   - The thread acts upon a cancellation request.
 *   - The thread calls pthread_cleanup_pop() with non-zero execute argument.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   routine - The cleanup routine to be pushed on the cleanup stack.
 *   arg     - An argument that will accompany the callback.
 *   execute - Execute the popped cleanup function immediately.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
