/* The state of a task is indicated both by the task_state field of the TCB
 * and by a series of task lists.  All of these tasks lists are declared
 * below. Although it is not always necessary, most of these lists are
 * prioritized so that common list handling logic can be used (only the
 * g_readytorun, the g_pendingtasks, and the g_waitingforsemaphore lists
 * need to be prioritized).
 */

/* This is the list of all tasks that are ready to run.  This is a
 * prioritized list with head of the list holding the highest priority
 * (unassigned) task.  In the non-SMP case, the head of this list is the
 * currently active task and the tail of this list, the lowest priority
 * task, is always the IDLE task.
 */

/* In order to support SMP, the function of the g_readytorun list changes,
 * The g_readytorun is still used but in the SMP case it will contain only:
 *
 *  - Only tasks/threads that are eligible to run, but not currently running,
 *    and
 *  - Tasks/threads that have not been assigned to a CPU.
 *
 * Otherwise, the TCB will be retained in an assigned task list,
 * g_assignedtasks.  As its name suggests, on 'g_assignedtasks queue for CPU
 * 'n' would contain only tasks/threads that are assigned to CPU 'n'.  Tasks/
 * threads would be assigned a particular CPU by one of two mechanisms:
 *
 *  - (Semi-)permanently through an RTOS interfaces such as
 *    pthread_attr_setaffinity(), or
 *  - Temporarily through scheduling logic when a previously unassigned task
 *    is made to run.
 *
 * Tasks/threads that are assigned to a CPU via an interface like
 * pthread_attr_setaffinity() would never go into the g_readytorun list, but
 * would only go into the g_assignedtasks[n] list for the CPU 'n' to which
 * the thread has been assigned.  Hence, the g_readytorun list would hold
 * only unassigned tasks/threads.
 *
 * Like the g_readytorun list in in non-SMP case, each g_assignedtask[] list
 * is prioritized:  The head of the list is the currently active task on this
 * CPU.  Tasks after the active task are ready-to-run and assigned to this
 * CPU. The tail of this assigned task list, the lowest priority task, is
 * always the CPU's IDLE task.
