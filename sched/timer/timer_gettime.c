 * Name: timer_gettime
 *
 * Description:
 *   The timer_gettime() function will store the amount of time until the
 *   specified timer, timerid, expires and the reload value of the timer
 *   into the space pointed to by the value argument. The it_value member
 *   of this structure will contain the amount of time before the timer
 *   expires, or zero if the timer is disarmed. This value is returned as
 *   the interval until timer expiration, even if the timer was armed with
 *   absolute time. The it_interval member of value will contain the reload
 *   value last set by timer_settime().
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   timerid - The pre-thread timer, previously created by the call to
 *   timer_create(), whose remaining time count will be returned..
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   If the timer_gettime() succeeds, a value of 0 (OK) will be returned.
 *   If an error occurs, the value -1 (ERROR) will be returned, and errno
 *   set to indicate the error.
 *
 *   EINVAL - The timerid argument does not correspond to an ID returned by
 *     timer_create() but not yet deleted by timer_delete().
 *
 * Assumptions/Limitations:
 *   Due to the asynchronous operation of this function, the time reported
 *   by this function could be significantly more than that actual time
 *   remaining on the timer at any time.
 *
