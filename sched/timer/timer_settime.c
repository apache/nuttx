/****************************************************************************
 * Name: timer_settime
 *
 * Description:
 *   The timer_settime() function sets the time until the next expiration of
 *   the timer specified by timerid from the it_value member of the value
 *   argument and arm the timer if the it_value member of value is non-zero.
 *   If the specified timer was already armed when timer_settime() is
 *   called, this call will reset the time until next expiration to the
 *   value specified. If the it_value member of value is zero, the timer
 *   will be disarmed. The effect of disarming or resetting a timer with
 *   pending expiration notifications is unspecified.
 *
 *   If the flag TIMER_ABSTIME is not set in the argument flags,
 *   timer_settime() will behave as if the time until next expiration is set
 *   to be equal to the interval specified by the it_value member of value.
 *   That is, the timer will expire in it_value nanoseconds from when the
 *   call is made. If the flag TIMER_ABSTIME is set in the argument flags,
 *   timer_settime() will behave as if the time until next expiration is set
 *   to be equal to the difference between the absolute time specified by
 *   the it_value member of value and the current value of the clock
 *   associated with timerid.  That is, the timer will expire when the clock
 *   reaches the value specified by the it_value member of value.  If the
 *   specified time has already passed, the function will succeed and the
 *   expiration notification will be made.
 *
 *   The reload value of the timer will be set to the value specified by the
 *   it_interval member of value.  When a timer is armed with a non-zero
 *   it_interval, a periodic (or repetitive) timer is specified.
 *
 *   Time values that are between two consecutive non-negative integer
 *   multiples of the resolution of the specified timer will be rounded up
 *   to the larger multiple of the resolution. Quantization error will not
 *   cause the timer to expire earlier than the rounded time value.
 *
 *   If the argument ovalue is not NULL, the timer_settime() function will
 *   store, in the location referenced by ovalue, a value representing the
 *   previous amount of time before the timer would have expired, or zero if
 *   the timer was disarmed, together with the previous timer reload value.
 *   Timers will not expire before their scheduled time.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   timerid - The pre-thread timer, previously created by the call to
 *     timer_create(), to be be set.
 *   flags - Specifies characteristics of the timer (see above)
 *   value - Specifies the timer value to set
 *   ovalue - A location in which to return the time remaining from the
 *     previous timer setting.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   If the timer_settime() succeeds, a value of 0 (OK) will be returned.
 *   If an error occurs, the value -1 (ERROR) will be returned, and errno set
 *   to indicate the error.
 *
 *   EINVAL - The timerid argument does not correspond to an ID returned by
 *     timer_create() but not yet deleted by timer_delete().
 *   EINVAL - A value structure specified a nanosecond value less than zero
 *     or greater than or equal to 1000 million, and the it_value member of
 *     that structure did not specify zero seconds and nanoseconds.
 *
 * Assumptions:
