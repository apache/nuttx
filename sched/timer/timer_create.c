/****************************************************************************
 * Name: timer_create
 *
 * Description:
 *   The  timer_create() function creates per-thread timer using the
 *   specified clock, clock_id, as the timing base. The timer_create()
 *   function returns, in the location referenced by timerid, a timer ID of
 *   type timer_t used to identify the timer in timer requests. This timer
 *   ID is unique until the timer is deleted. The particular clock, clock_id,
 *   is defined in <time.h>. The timer whose ID is returned will be in a
 *   disarmed state upon return from timer_create().
 *
 *   The evp argument, if non-NULL, points to a sigevent structure. This
 *   structure is allocated by the called and defines the asynchronous
 *   notification to occur.  If the evp argument is NULL, the effect is as
 *   if the evp argument pointed to a sigevent structure with the
 *   sigev_notify member having the value SIGEV_SIGNAL, the sigev_signo
 *   having a default signal number, and the sigev_value member having the
 *   value of the timer ID.
 *
 *   Each implementation defines a set of clocks that can be used as timing
 *   bases for per-thread timers. All implementations shall support a
 *   clock_id of CLOCK_REALTIME.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   clockid - Specifies the clock to use as the timing base.
 *   evp - Refers to a user allocated sigevent structure that defines the
 *     asynchronous notification.  evp may be NULL (see above).
 *   timerid - The pre-thread timer created by the call to timer_create().
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   If the call succeeds, timer_create() will return 0 (OK) and update the
 *   location referenced by timerid to a timer_t, which can be passed to the
 *   other per-thread timer calls.  If an error occurs, the function will
 *   return a value of -1 (ERROR) and set errno to indicate the error.
 *
 *   EAGAIN - The system lacks sufficient signal queuing resources to honor
 *     the request.
 *   EAGAIN - The calling process has already created all of the timers it
 *     is allowed by this implementation.
 *   EINVAL - The specified clock ID is not defined.
 *   ENOTSUP - The implementation does not support the creation of a timer
 *     attached to the CPU-time clock that is specified by clock_id and
 *     associated with a thread different thread invoking timer_create().
 *
 * Assumptions:
