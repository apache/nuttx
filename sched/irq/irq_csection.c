 * Name: irq_waitlock
 *
 * Description:
 *   Spin to get g_irq_waitlock, handling a known deadlock condition:
 *
 *   A deadlock may occur if enter_critical_section is called from an
 *   interrupt handler.  Suppose:
 *
 *   - CPUn is in a critical section and has the g_cpu_irqlock spinlock.
 *   - CPUm takes an interrupt and attempts to enter the critical section.
 *   - It spins waiting on g_cpu_irqlock with interrupts disabled.
 *   - CPUn calls up_cpu_pause() to pause operation on CPUm.  This will
 *     issue an inter-CPU interrupt to CPUm
 *   - But interrupts are disabled on CPUm so the up_cpu_pause() is never
 *     handled, causing the deadlock.
 *
 *   This same deadlock can occur in the normal tasking case:
 *
 *   - A task on CPUn enters a critical section and has the g_cpu_irqlock
 *     spinlock.
 *   - Another task on CPUm attempts to enter the critical section but has
 *     to wait, spinning to get g_cpu_irqlock with interrupts disabled.
 *   - The task on CPUn causes a new task to become ready-to-run and the
 *     scheduler selects CPUm.  CPUm is requested to pause via a pause
 *     interrupt.
 *   - But the task on CPUm is also attempting to enter the critical
 *     section.  Since it is spinning with interrupts disabled, CPUm cannot
 *     process the pending pause interrupt, causing the deadlock.
 *
 *   This function detects this deadlock condition while spinning with \
 *   interrupts disabled.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   cpu - The index of CPU that is trying to enter the critical section.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   True:  The g_cpu_irqlock spinlock has been taken.
 *   False: The g_cpu_irqlock spinlock has not been taken yet, but there is
 *          a pending pause interrupt request.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name:  irq_cpu_locked
 *
 * Description:
 *   Test if the IRQ lock set OR if this CPU holds the IRQ lock
 *   There is an interaction with pre-emption controls and IRQ locking:
 *   Even if the pre-emption is enabled, tasks will be forced to pend if
 *   the IRQ lock is also set UNLESS the CPU starting the task is the
 *   holder of the IRQ lock.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   rtcb - Points to the blocked TCB that is ready-to-run
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   true  - IRQs are locked by a different CPU.
 *   false - IRQs are unlocked OR if they are locked BUT this CPU
 *           is the holder of the lock.
 *
 *   Warning: This values are volatile at only valid at the instance that
 *   the CPU set was queried.
