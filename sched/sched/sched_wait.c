/****************************************************************************
 * Name: wait
 *
 * Description:
 *   The wait() function will suspend execution of the calling thread until
 *   status information for one of its terminated child processes is
 *   available, or until delivery of a signal whose action is either to
 *   execute a signal-catching function or to terminate the process. If more
 *   than one thread is suspended in wait() or waitpid() awaiting termination
 *   of the same process, exactly one thread will return the process status
 *   at the time of the target process termination. If status information is
 *   available prior to the call to wait(), return will be immediate.
 *
 *   The waitpid() function will behave identically to wait(), if the pid
 *   argument is (pid_t)-1 and the options argument is 0. Otherwise, its
 *   behaviour will be modified by the values of the pid and options
 *   arguments.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   stat_loc - The location to return the exit status
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   See waitpid();
 *
