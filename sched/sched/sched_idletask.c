 * Name: sched_idletask
 *
 * Description:
 *   Check if the caller is an IDLE thread.  For most implementations of
 *   the SYSLOG output semaphore locking is required for mutual exclusion.
 *   The idle threads are unable to lock semaphores because they cannot
 *   want.  So IDLE thread output is a special case and is treated much as
 *   we treat debug output from an interrupt handler.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   true if the calling task is and IDLE thread.
 *

       * (3) It should have the TCB_FLAG_CPU_LOCKED flag set.

       * In the non-SMP case, the IDLE task will also have PID=0, but that
       * is not a portable test because there are multiple IDLE tasks with
       * different PIDs in the SMP configuration.
