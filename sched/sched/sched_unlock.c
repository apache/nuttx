 * Name:  sched_unlock
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function decrements the preemption lock count.  Typically this
 *   is paired with sched_lock() and concludes a critical section of
 *   code.  Preemption will not be unlocked until sched_unlock() has
 *   been called as many times as sched_lock().  When the lockcount is
 *   decremented to zero, any tasks that were eligible to preempt the
 *   current task will execute.
