 * Name:  nxsched_process_roundrobin
 *
 * Description:
 *   Check if the currently executing task has exceeded its time slice.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   tcb - The TCB of the currently executing task
 *   ticks - The number of ticks that have elapsed on the interval timer.
 *   noswitches - True: Can't do context switches now.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   The number if ticks remaining until the next time slice expires.
 *   Zero is returned if there is no time slicing (i.e., the task at the
 *   head of the ready-to-run list does not support round robin
 *   scheduling).
 *
 *   The value one may returned under certain circumstances that probably
 *   can't happen.  The value one is the minimal timer setup and it means
 *   that a context switch is needed now, but cannot be performed because
 *   noswitches == true.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   - Interrupts are disabled
 *   - The task associated with TCB uses the round robin scheduling
 *     policy
 *
