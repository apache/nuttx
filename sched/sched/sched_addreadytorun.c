 * Name:  nxsched_add_readytorun
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function adds a TCB to the ready to run list.  If the currently
 *   active task has preemption disabled and the new TCB would cause this
 *   task to be pre-empted, the new task is added to the g_pendingtasks list
 *   instead.  The pending tasks will be made ready-to-run when preemption is
 *   unlocked.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   btcb - Points to the blocked TCB that is ready-to-run
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   true if the currently active task (the head of the ready-to-run list)
 *   has changed.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - The caller has established a critical section before calling this
 *   function (calling sched_lock() first is NOT a good idea -- use
 *   enter_critical_section()).
 * - The caller has already removed the input rtcb from whatever list it
 *   was in.
 * - The caller handles the condition that occurs if the head of the
 *   ready-to-run list is changed.

 *   1. The g_readytorun list if the task is ready-to-run but not running

 *   would cause this task to be pre-empted, the new task is added to the
 *   g_pendingtasks list instead.  The pending tasks will be made
 *   ready-to-run when preemption isunlocked.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
