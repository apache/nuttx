/* Pre-emption is disabled via the interface sched_lock(). sched_lock()
 * works by preventing context switches from the currently executing tasks.
 * This prevents other tasks from running (without disabling interrupts) and
 * gives the currently executing task exclusive access to the (single) CPU
 * resources. Thus, sched_lock() and its companion, sched_unlock(), are
 * used to implement some critical sections.
 *
 * In the single CPU case, pre-emption is disabled using a simple lockcount
 * in the TCB. When the scheduling is locked, the lockcount is incremented;
 * when the scheduler is unlocked, the lockcount is decremented. If the
 * lockcount for the task at the head of the g_readytorun list has a
 * lockcount > 0, then pre-emption is disabled.
 *
 * No special protection is required since only the executing task can
 * modify its lockcount.
 */

#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
/* In the multiple CPU, SMP case, disabling context switches will not give a
 * task exclusive access to the (multiple) CPU resources (at least without
 * stopping the other CPUs): Even though pre-emption is disabled, other
 * threads will still be executing on the other CPUS.
 *
 * There are additional rules for this multi-CPU case:
 *
 * 1. There is a global lock count 'g_cpu_lockset' that includes a bit for
 *    each CPU: If the bit is '1', then the corresponding CPU has the
 *    scheduler locked; if '0', then the CPU does not have the scheduler
 *    locked.
 * 2. Scheduling logic would set the bit associated with the cpu in
 *    'g_cpu_lockset' when the TCB at the head of the g_assignedtasks[cpu]
 *    list transitions has 'lockcount' > 0. This might happen when sched_lock()
 *    is called, or after a context switch that changes the TCB at the
 *    head of the g_assignedtasks[cpu] list.
 * 3. Similarly, the cpu bit in the global 'g_cpu_lockset' would be cleared
 *    when the TCB at the head of the g_assignedtasks[cpu] list has
 *    'lockcount' == 0. This might happen when sched_unlock() is called, or
 *    after a context switch that changes the TCB at the head of the
 *    g_assignedtasks[cpu] list.
 * 4. Modification of the global 'g_cpu_lockset' must be protected by a
 *    spinlock, 'g_cpu_schedlock'. That spinlock would be taken when
 *    sched_lock() is called, and released when sched_unlock() is called.
 *    This assures that the scheduler does enforce the critical section.
 *    NOTE: Because of this spinlock, there should never be more than one
 *    bit set in 'g_cpu_lockset'; attempts to set additional bits should
 *    be cause the CPU to block on the spinlock.  However, additional bits
 *    could get set in 'g_cpu_lockset' due to the context switches on the
 *    various CPUs.
 * 5. Each the time the head of a g_assignedtasks[] list changes and the
 *    scheduler modifies 'g_cpu_lockset', it must also set 'g_cpu_schedlock'
 *    depending on the new state of 'g_cpu_lockset'.
 * 5. Logic that currently uses the currently running tasks lockcount
 *    instead uses the global 'g_cpu_schedlock'. A value of SP_UNLOCKED
 *    means that no CPU has pre-emption disabled; SP_LOCKED means that at
 *    least one CPU has pre-emption disabled.
