/* Pre-emption is disabled via the interface sched_lock(). sched_lock()
 * works by preventing context switches from the currently executing tasks.
 * This prevents other tasks from running (without disabling interrupts) and
 * gives the currently executing task exclusive access to the (single) CPU
 * resources. Thus, sched_lock() and its companion, sched_unlock(), are
 * used to implement some critical sections.
 *
 * In the single CPU case, pre-emption is disabled using a simple lockcount
 * in the TCB. When the scheduling is locked, the lockcount is incremented;
 * when the scheduler is unlocked, the lockcount is decremented. If the
 * lockcount for the task at the head of the g_readytorun list has a
 * lockcount > 0, then pre-emption is disabled.
 *
 * No special protection is required since only the executing task can
 * modify its lockcount.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name:  sched_lock
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function disables context switching by disabling addition of
 *   new tasks to the g_readytorun task list.  The task that calls this
 *   function will be the only task that is allowed to run until it
 *   either calls  sched_unlock() (the appropriate number of times) or
 *   until it blocks itself.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK on success; ERROR on failure
