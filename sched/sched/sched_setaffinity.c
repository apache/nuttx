 * Name: nxsched_setaffinity
 *
 * Description:
 *   sched_setaffinity() sets the CPU affinity mask of the thread whose ID
 *   is pid to the value specified by mask.  If pid is zero, then the
 *   calling thread is used.  The argument cpusetsize is the length (i
 *   bytes) of the data pointed to by mask.  Normally this argument would
 *   be specified as sizeof(cpu_set_t).
 *
 *   If the thread specified by pid is not currently running on one of the
 *   CPUs specified in mask, then that thread is migrated to one of the
 *   CPUs specified in mask.
 *
 *   nxsched_setaffinity() is identical to the function sched_setparam(),
 *   differing only in its return value:  This function does not modify
 *   the errno variable.  This is a non-standard, internal OS function and
 *   is not intended for use by application logic.  Applications should
 *   use the standard sched_setparam().
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   pid        - The ID of thread whose affinity set will be modified.
 *   cpusetsize - Size of mask.  MUST be sizeofcpu_set_t().
 *   mask       - The location to return the thread's new affinity set.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) if successful.  Otherwise, a negated errno value is returned:
 *
 *     ESRCH  The task whose ID is pid could not be found.
