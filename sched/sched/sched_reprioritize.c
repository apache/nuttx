 * Name:  nxsched_reprioritize
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function sets the priority of a specified task.
 *
 *   NOTE: Setting a task's priority to the same value has a similar effect
 *   to sched_yield() -- The task will be moved to  after all other tasks
 *   with the same priority.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   tcb - the TCB of task to reprioritize.
 *   sched_priority - The new task priority
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, sched_reporioritize() returns 0 (OK). On error, a negated
 *   errno value is returned.
 *
 *   EINVAL The parameter 'param' is invalid or does not make sense for the
 *          current scheduling policy.
 *   EPERM  The calling task does not have appropriate privileges.
 *   ESRCH  The task whose ID is pid could not be found.
 *
