 * Name: sched_gettcb
 *
 * Description:
 *   Given a task ID, this function will return the a pointer to the
 *   corresponding TCB (or NULL if there is no such task ID).
 *
 *   NOTE:  This function holds a critical section while examining TCB data
 *   data structures but releases that critical section before returning.
 *   When it is released, the TCB may become unstable.  If the caller
 *   requires absolute stability while using the TCB, then the caller
 *   should establish the critical section BEFORE calling this function and
 *   hold that critical section as long as necessary.
