 *   priority tasks.  The IDLE threads will only take the KMM semaphore if
 *   there is garbage to be collected.
 *
 *   Certainly there is a race condition involved in sampling the garbage
 *   state.  The looping nature of the IDLE loops should catch any missed
 *   garbage from the test on the next time around.
