 * Name: ppoll
 *
 * Description:
 *   ppoll() waits for one of a set of file descriptors to become ready to
 *   perform I/O.  If none of the events requested (and no error) has
 *   occurred for any of  the  file  descriptors,  then ppoll() blocks until
 *   one of the events occurs.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   fds  - List of structures describing file descriptors to be monitored
 *   nfds - The number of entries in the list
 *   timeout - Specifies an upper limit on the time for which ppoll() will
 *     block.  A NULL pointer means an infinite timeout.
 *   sigmask - Replace the current signal mask temporarily during execution
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, the number of structures that have non-zero revents fields.
 *   A value of 0 indicates that the call timed out and no file descriptors
 *   were ready.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately:
 *
 *   EBADF  - An invalid file descriptor was given in one of the sets.
 *   EFAULT - The fds address is invalid
 *   EINTR  - A signal occurred before any requested event.
 *   EINVAL - The nfds value exceeds a system limit.
 *   ENOMEM - There was no space to allocate internal data structures.
 *   ENOSYS - One or more of the drivers supporting the file descriptor
 *     does not support the poll method.
