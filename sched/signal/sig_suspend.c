/****************************************************************************
 * Name: sigsuspend
 *
 * Description:
 *
 *   The sigsuspend() function replaces the signal mask of the task with the
 *   set of signals pointed to by the argument 'set' and then suspends the
 *   process until delivery of a signal to the task.
 *
 *   If the effect of the set argument is to unblock a pending signal, then
 *   no wait is performed.
 *
 *   The original signal mask is restored when this function returns.
 *
 *   Waiting for an empty signal set stops a task without freeing any
 *   resources.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   set - signal mask to use while suspended.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   -1 (ERROR) always
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *
 * POSIX Compatibility:
 *   int sigsuspend(const sigset_t *set);
 *
 *   POSIX states that sigsuspend() "suspends the process until delivery of
 *   a signal whose action is either to execute a signal-catching function
 *   or to terminate the process."  Only the deliver of a signal is required
 *   in the present implementation (even if the signal is ignored).
