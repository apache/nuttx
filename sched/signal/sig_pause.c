 * Name: pause
 *
 * Description:
 *   The pause() function will suspend the calling thread until delivery of a
 *   non-blocked signal.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Since pause() suspends thread execution indefinitely unless interrupted
 *   a signal, there is no successful completion return value. A value of -1
 *   will always be returned and errno set to indicate the error (EINTR).
 *
 * POSIX compatibility:
 *   In the POSIX description of this function is the pause() function will
 *   suspend the calling thread until delivery of a signal whose action is
 *   either to execute a signal-catching function or to terminate the
 *   process.  This implementation only waits for any non-blocked signal
 *   to be received.
 *
