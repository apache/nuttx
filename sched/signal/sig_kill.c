/****************************************************************************
 * Name: nxsig_kill
 *
 * Description:
 *   The nxsig_kill() system call can be used to send any signal to any task
 *   group.
 *
 *   This is an internal OS interface.  It is functionally equivalent to
 *   the POSIX standard kill() function but does not modify the application
 *   errno variable.
 *
 *   Limitation: Sending of signals to 'process groups' is not
 *   supported in NuttX
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   pid - The id of the task to receive the signal.  The POSIX nxsig_kill
 *     specification encodes process group information as zero and
 *     negative pid values.  Only positive, non-zero values of pid are
 *     supported by this implementation.
 *   signo - The signal number to send.  If signo is zero, no signal is
 *     sent, but all error checking is performed.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This is an internal OS interface and should not be used by applications.
 *   It follows the NuttX internal error return policy:  Zero (OK) is
 *   returned on success.  A negated errno value is returned on failure.
 *
 *    EINVAL An invalid signal was specified.
 *    EPERM  The process does not have permission to send the
 *           signal to any of the target processes.
 *    ESRCH  The pid or process group does not exist.
 *    ENOSYS Do not support sending signals to process groups.
