/****************************************************************************
 * Name: nxsig_timedwait
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function selects the pending signal set specified by the argument
 *   set.  If multiple signals are pending in set, it will remove and return
 *   the lowest numbered one.  If no signals in set are pending at the time
 *   of the call, the calling process will be suspended until one of the
 *   signals in set becomes pending, OR until the process is interrupted by
 *   an unblocked signal, OR until the time interval specified by timeout
 *   (if any), has expired. If timeout is NULL, then the timeout interval
 *   is forever.
 *
 *   If the info argument is non-NULL, the selected signal number is stored
 *   in the si_signo member and the cause of the signal is stored in the
 *   si_code member.  The content of si_value is only meaningful if the
 *   signal was generated by sigqueue() (or nxsig_queue).
 *
 *   This is an internal OS interface.  It is functionally equivalent to
 *   sigtimedwait() except that:
 *
 *   - It is not a cancellation point, and
 *   - It does not modify the errno value.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   set     - The pending signal set.
 *   info    - The returned value (may be NULL).
 *   timeout - The amount of time to wait (may be NULL)
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This is an internal OS interface and should not be used by applications.
 *   It follows the NuttX internal error return policy:  Zero (OK) is
 *   returned on success.  A negated errno value is returned on failure.
 *
 *   EAGAIN - No signal specified by set was generated within the specified
 *            timeout period.
 *   EINTR  - The wait was interrupted by an unblocked, caught signal.
