 * Name: nxmq_send
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function adds the specified message (msg) to the message queue
 *   (mqdes).  This is an internal OS interface.  It is functionally
 *   equivalent to mq_send() except that:
 *
 *   - It is not a cancellation point, and
 *   - It does not modify the errno value.
 *
 *  See comments with mq_send() for a more complete description of the
 *  behavior of this function
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   mqdes  - Message queue descriptor
 *   msg    - Message to send
 *   msglen - The length of the message in bytes
 *   prio   - The priority of the message
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This is an internal OS interface and should not be used by applications.
 *   It follows the NuttX internal error return policy:  Zero (OK) is
 *   returned on success.  A negated errno value is returned on failure.
 *   (see mq_send() for the list list valid return values).

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: mq_send
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function adds the specified message (msg) to the message queue
 *   (mqdes).  The "msglen" parameter specifies the length of the message
 *   in bytes pointed to by "msg."  This length must not exceed the maximum
 *   message length from the mq_getattr().
 *
 *   If the message queue is not full, mq_send() place the message in the
 *   message queue at the position indicated by the "prio" argument.
 *   Messages with higher priority will be inserted before lower priority
 *   messages.  The value of "prio" must not exceed MQ_PRIO_MAX.
 *
 *   If the specified message queue is full and O_NONBLOCK is not set in the
 *   message queue, then mq_send() will block until space becomes available
 *   to the queue the message.
 *
 *   If the message queue is full and O_NONBLOCK is set, the message is not
 *   queued and ERROR is returned.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   mqdes  - Message queue descriptor
 *   msg    - Message to send
 *   msglen - The length of the message in bytes
 *   prio   - The priority of the message
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, mq_send() returns 0 (OK); on error, -1 (ERROR)
 *   is returned, with errno set to indicate the error:
 *
 *   EAGAIN   The queue was full and the O_NONBLOCK flag was set for the
 *            message queue description referred to by mqdes.
 *   EINVAL   Either msg or mqdes is NULL or the value of prio is invalid.
 *   EPERM    Message queue opened not opened for writing.
 *   EMSGSIZE 'msglen' was greater than the maxmsgsize attribute of the
 *            message queue.
 *   EINTR    The call was interrupted by a signal handler.
