/****************************************************************************
 * Name: nxmq_timedsend
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function adds the specified message (msg) to the message queue
 *   (mqdes).  nxmq_timedsend() behaves just like mq_send(), except
 *   that if the queue is full and the O_NONBLOCK flag is not enabled for
 *   the message queue description, then abstime points to a structure which
 *   specifies a ceiling on the time for which the call will block.
 *
 *   nxmq_timedsend() is functionally equivalent to mq_timedsend() except
 *   that:
 *
 *   - It is not a cancellation point, and
 *   - It does not modify the errno value.
 *
 *  See comments with mq_timedsend() for a more complete description of the
 *  behavior of this function
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   mqdes   - Message queue descriptor
 *   msg     - Message to send
 *   msglen  - The length of the message in bytes
 *   prio    - The priority of the message
 *   abstime - the absolute time to wait until a timeout is decleared
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This is an internal OS interface and should not be used by applications.
 *   It follows the NuttX internal error return policy:  Zero (OK) is
 *   returned on success.  A negated errno value is returned on failure.
 *   (see mq_timedsend() for the list list valid return values).
 *
 *   EAGAIN   The queue was empty, and the O_NONBLOCK flag was set for the
 *            message queue description referred to by mqdes.
 *   EINVAL   Either msg or mqdes is NULL or the value of prio is invalid.
 *   EPERM    Message queue opened not opened for writing.
 *   EMSGSIZE 'msglen' was greater than the maxmsgsize attribute of the
 *            message queue.
 *   EINTR    The call was interrupted by a signal handler.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: mq_timedsend
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function adds the specified message (msg) to the message queue
 *   (mqdes).  The "msglen" parameter specifies the length of the message
 *   in bytes pointed to by "msg."  This length must not exceed the maximum
 *   message length from the mq_getattr().
 *
 *   If the message queue is not full, mq_timedsend() place the message in the
 *   message queue at the position indicated by the "prio" argrument.
 *   Messages with higher priority will be inserted before lower priority
 *   messages.  The value of "prio" must not exceed MQ_PRIO_MAX.
 *
 *   If the specified message queue is full and O_NONBLOCK is not set in the
 *   message queue, then mq_timedsend() will block until space becomes available
 *   to the queue the message or a timeout occurs.
 *
 *   mq_timedsend() behaves just like mq_send(), except that if the queue
 *   is full and the O_NONBLOCK flag is not enabled for the message queue
 *   description, then abstime points to a structure which specifies a
 *   ceiling on the time for which the call will block.  This ceiling is an
 *   absolute timeout in seconds and nanoseconds since the Epoch (midnight
 *   on the morning of 1 January 1970).
 *
 *   If the message queue is full, and the timeout has already expired by
 *   the time of the call, mq_timedsend() returns immediately.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   mqdes   - Message queue descriptor
 *   msg     - Message to send
 *   msglen  - The length of the message in bytes
 *   prio    - The priority of the message
 *   abstime - the absolute time to wait until a timeout is decleared
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, mq_send() returns 0 (OK); on error, -1 (ERROR)
 *   is returned, with errno set to indicate the error:
 *
 *   EAGAIN   The queue was empty, and the O_NONBLOCK flag was set for the
 *            message queue description referred to by mqdes.
 *   EINVAL   Either msg or mqdes is NULL or the value of prio is invalid.
 *   EPERM    Message queue opened not opened for writing.
 *   EMSGSIZE 'msglen' was greater than the maxmsgsize attribute of the
 *            message queue.
 *   EINTR    The call was interrupted by a signal handler.

 * Assumptions/restrictions:
