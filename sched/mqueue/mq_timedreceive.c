/****************************************************************************
 * Name: nxmq_timedreceive
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function receives the oldest of the highest priority messages from
 *   the message queue specified by "mqdes."  If the message queue is empty
 *   and O_NONBLOCK was not set, nxmq_timedreceive() will block until a
 *   message is added to the message queue (or until a timeout occurs).
 *
 *   nxmq_timedreceive() is an internal OS interface.  It is functionally
 *   equivalent to mq_timedreceive() except that:
 *
 *   - It is not a cancellation point, and
 *   - It does not modify the errno value.
 *
 *  See comments with mq_timedreceive() for a more complete description of
 *  the behavior of this function
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   mqdes   - Message Queue Descriptor
 *   msg     - Buffer to receive the message
 *   msglen  - Size of the buffer in bytes
 *   prio    - If not NULL, the location to store message priority.
 *   abstime - the absolute time to wait until a timeout is declared.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This is an internal OS interface and should not be used by applications.
 *   It follows the NuttX internal error return policy:  Zero (OK) is
 *   returned on success.  A negated errno value is returned on failure.
 *   (see mq_timedreceive() for the list list valid return values).

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: mq_timedreceive
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function receives the oldest of the highest priority messages from
 *   the message queue specified by "mqdes."  If the size of the buffer in
 *   bytes (msglen) is less than the "mq_msgsize" attribute of the message
 *   queue, mq_timedreceive will return an error.  Otherwise, the selected
 *   message is removed from the queue and copied to "msg."
 *
 *   If the message queue is empty and O_NONBLOCK was not set,
 *   mq_timedreceive() will block until a message is added to the message
 *   queue (or until a timeout occurs).  If more than one task is waiting
 *   to receive a message, only the task with the highest priority that has
 *   waited the longest will be unblocked.
 *
 *   mq_timedreceive() behaves just like mq_receive(), except that if the
 *   queue is empty and the O_NONBLOCK flag is not enabled for the message
 *   queue description, then abstime points to a structure which specifies a
 *   ceiling on the time for which the call will block.  This ceiling is an
 *   absolute timeout in seconds and nanoseconds since the Epoch (midnight
 *   on the morning of 1 January 1970).
 *
 *   If no message is available, and the timeout has already expired by the
 *   time of the call, mq_timedreceive() returns immediately.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   mqdes   - Message Queue Descriptor
 *   msg     - Buffer to receive the message
 *   msglen  - Size of the buffer in bytes
 *   prio    - If not NULL, the location to store message priority.
 *   abstime - the absolute time to wait until a timeout is declared.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   One success, the length of the selected message in bytes is returned.
 *   On failure, -1 (ERROR) is returned and the errno is set appropriately:
 *
 *   EAGAIN    The queue was empty, and the O_NONBLOCK flag was set
 *             for the message queue description referred to by 'mqdes'.
 *   EPERM     Message queue opened not opened for reading.
 *   EMSGSIZE  'msglen' was less than the maxmsgsize attribute of the
 *             message queue.
 *   EINTR     The call was interrupted by a signal handler.
 *   EINVAL    Invalid 'msg' or 'mqdes' or 'abstime'
 *   ETIMEDOUT The call timed out before a message could be transferred.
