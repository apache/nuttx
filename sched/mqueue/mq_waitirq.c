 * Name: nxmq_wait_irq
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is called when a signal or a timeout is received by a
 *   task that is waiting on a message queue -- either for a queue to
 *   becoming not full (on mq_send and friends) or not empty (on mq_receive
 *   and friends).
 *   Note: this function should used within critical_section
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   wtcb - A pointer to the TCB of the task that is waiting on a message
 *          queue, but has received a signal instead.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *
