 * Name: nxmq_receive
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function receives the oldest of the highest priority messages
 *   from the message queue specified by "mqdes."  This is an internal OS
 *   interface.  It is functionally equivalent to mq_receive except that:
 *
 *   - It is not a cancellation point, and
 *   - It does not modify the errno value.
 *
 *  See comments with mq_receive() for a more complete description of the
 *  behavior of this function
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   mqdes  - Message Queue Descriptor
 *   msg    - Buffer to receive the message
 *   msglen - Size of the buffer in bytes
 *   prio   - If not NULL, the location to store message priority.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This is an internal OS interface and should not be used by applications.
 *   It follows the NuttX internal error return policy:  Zero (OK) is
 *   returned on success.  A negated errno value is returned on failure.
 *   (see mq_receive() for the list list valid return values).

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: mq_receive
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function receives the oldest of the highest priority messages
 *   from the message queue specified by "mqdes."  If the size of the
 *   buffer in bytes (msglen) is less than the "mq_msgsize" attribute of
 *   the message queue, mq_receive will return an error.  Otherwise, the
 *   selected message is removed from the queue and copied to "msg."
 *
 *   If the message queue is empty and O_NONBLOCK was not set,
 *   mq_receive() will block until a message is added to the message
 *   queue.  If more than one task is waiting to receive a message, only
 *   the task with the highest priority that has waited the longest will
 *   be unblocked.
 *
 *   If the queue is empty and O_NONBLOCK is set, ERROR will be returned.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   mqdes  - Message Queue Descriptor
 *   msg    - Buffer to receive the message
 *   msglen - Size of the buffer in bytes
 *   prio   - If not NULL, the location to store message priority.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   One success, the length of the selected message in bytes is returned.
 *   On failure, -1 (ERROR) is returned and the errno is set appropriately:
 *
 *   EAGAIN   The queue was empty, and the O_NONBLOCK flag was set
 *            for the message queue description referred to by 'mqdes'.
 *   EPERM    Message queue opened not opened for reading.
 *   EMSGSIZE 'msglen' was less than the maxmsgsize attribute of the
 *            message queue.
 *   EINTR    The call was interrupted by a signal handler.
 *   EINVAL   Invalid 'msg' or 'mqdes'
