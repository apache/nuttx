 * Name: wd_recover
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is called from nxtask_recover() when a task is deleted via
 *   task_delete() or via pthread_cancel(). It checks if the deleted task
 *   is waiting for a timed event and if so cancels the timeout
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   tcb - The TCB of the terminated task or thread
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   This function is called from task deletion logic in a safe context.
 *
