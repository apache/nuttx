/****************************************************************************
 * Name: wd_start
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function adds a watchdog timer to the active timer queue.  The
 *   specified watchdog function at 'wdentry' will be called from the
 *   interrupt level after the specified number of ticks has elapsed.
 *   Watchdog timers may be started from the interrupt level.
 *
 *   Watchdog timers execute in the address environment that was in effect
 *   when wd_start() is called.
 *
 *   Watchdog timers execute only once.
 *
 *   To replace either the timeout delay or the function to be executed,
 *   call wd_start again with the same wdog; only the most recent wdStart()
 *   on a given watchdog ID has any effect.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   wdog     - watchdog ID
 *   delay    - Delay count in clock ticks
 *   wdentry  - function to call on timeout
 *   parm1..4 - parameters to pass to wdentry
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success; a negated errno value is return to
 *   indicate the nature of any failure.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   The watchdog routine runs in the context of the timer interrupt handler
 *   and is subject to all ISR restrictions.
