 * Name: wd_cancel
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function cancels a currently running watchdog timer. Watchdog
 *   timers may be canceled from the interrupt level.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   wdog - ID of the watchdog to cancel.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success;  A negated errno value is returned to
 *   indicate the nature of any failure.
