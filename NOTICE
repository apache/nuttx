FAT Long File Names
===================

  NOTE:  If CONFIG_FAT_LFN is defined in your NuttX configuration file, then
  there may be some legal, patent issues. The following was extracted from
  the entry "File Allocation Table from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

    "On December 3, 2003 Microsoft announced it would be offering licenses
     for use of its FAT specification and 'associated intellectual property',
     at the cost of a US$0.25 royalty per unit sold, with a $250,000 maximum
     royalty per license agreement.

     o "U.S. Patent 5,745,902 (http://www.google.com/patents?vid=5745902) -
        Method and system for accessing a file using file names having
        different file name formats. ...
     o "U.S. Patent 5,579,517 (http://www.google.com/patents?vid=5579517) -
        Common name space for long and short filenames. ...
     o "U.S. Patent 5,758,352 (http://www.google.com/patents?vid=5758352) -
        Common name space for long and short filenames. ...
     o "U.S. Patent 6,286,013 (http://www.google.com/patents?vid=6286013) -
        Method and system for providing a common name space for long and
        short file names in an operating system. ...

    "Many technical commentators have concluded that these patents only cover
     FAT implementations that include support for long filenames, and that
     removable solid state media and consumer devices only using short names
     would be unaffected. ..."

  This Wikipedia entry has been updated with recent legal decisions in favor
  of Microsoft. Refer to:

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table#Patents

  So you have been forewarned:  Use the long filename at your own risk!
