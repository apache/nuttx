 * Name: i2c_write
 *
 * Description:
 *   Send a block of data on I2C. Each write operation will be an 'atomic'
 *   operation in the sense that any other I2C actions will be serialized
 *   and pend until this write completes.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   dev    - Device-specific state data
 *   config  - Described the I2C configuration
 *   buffer - A pointer to the read-only buffer of data to be written to
 *            device
 *   buflen - The number of bytes to send from the buffer
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   0: success, <0: A negated errno
 *
