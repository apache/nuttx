 * Name: i2c_read
 *
 * Description:
 *   Receive a block of data from I2C. Each read operation will be an
 *   'atomic' operation in the sense that any other I2C actions will be
 *   serialized and pend until this read completes.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   dev    - Device-specific state data
 *   buffer - A pointer to a buffer of data to receive the data from the
 *            device
 *   buflen - The requested number of bytes to be read
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   0: success, <0: A negated errno
 *
