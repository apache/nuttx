config ARCH_HAVE_I2CRESET
	bool
	default n

config BOARD_HAVE_I2CMUX
	bool
	default n

menuconfig I2C
	bool "I2C Driver Support"
	default n
	---help---
		This selection enables building of the "upper-half" I2C driver.
		See include/nuttx/i2c/i2c_master.h for further I2C driver information.

if I2C

config I2C_SLAVE
	bool "I2C Slave"
	default n

config I2C_POLLED
	bool "Polled I2C (no interrupts)"
	default n

config I2C_RESET
	bool "Support I2C reset interface method"
	default n
	depends on ARCH_HAVE_I2CRESET

config I2C_TRACE
	bool "Enable I2C trace debug"
	default n

config I2C_NTRACE
	int "Number of I2C trace records"
	default 32
	depends on I2C_TRACE

config I2C_BITBANG
	bool "I2C bitbang implementation"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable support for a bitbang implementation of I2C

if I2C_BITBANG

config I2C_BITBANG_NO_DELAY
	bool "Do not add delay"
	default n
	---help---
		If you want to go full speed (depending on how fast pins can be toggled)
		you can enable this option. This will not respect the desired frequency
		set during the I2C transfer operation.

config I2C_BITBANG_GPIO_OVERHEAD
	int "GPIO overhead"
	depends on !I2C_BITBANG_NO_DELAY
	default 0
	---help---
		Overhead of GPIO toggling operation to consider when computing
		delays. This overhead will be subtracted from sleep times to achieve
		desired frequency.

config I2C_BITBANG_TIMEOUT
	int "I2C timeout"
	default 1000
	---help---
		Timeout (microseconds) to abort wait on slave.

config I2C_BITBANG_CLOCK_STRETCHING
	bool "Support clock stretching"
	default n
	---help---
		This enables I2C clock stretching. This requires the hardware to set
		the pin into open-collector mode (master sets SCL high and waits until
		slave stops holding it low).

endif # I2C_BITBANG

config I2C_DRIVER
	bool "I2C character driver"
	default n
	---help---
		Build in support for a character driver at /dev/i2c[N] that may be
		used to perform I2C bus transfers from applications.  The intent of
		this driver is to support I2C testing.  It is not suitable for use
		in any real driver application.

	bool "PCA9540BDP NXP multiplexer"
	default n
	depends on I2C

	---help---
		Enable support for the NXP PCA9540BDP i2c multiplexer

config I2CMULTIPLEXER_TCA9548A
	bool "TCA9548A TI multiplexer"
	default n
	depends on I2C
	select BOARD_HAVE_I2CMUX
	---help---
		Enable support for the TI TCA9548A i2c multiplexer
