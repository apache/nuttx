config AUDIO_I2SCHAR
	bool "I2S character driver (for testing only)"
	default n
	---help---
		This selection enables a simple character driver that supports I2S
		transfers via a read() and write().  The intent of this driver is to
		support I2S testing.  It is not an audio driver but does conform to
		some of the buffer management heuristics of an audio driver.  It is
		not suitable for use in any real driver application in its current
		form.

if AUDIO_I2SCHAR

config AUDIO_I2SCHAR_RXTIMEOUT
	int "RX timeout"
	default 0
	---help---
		This is a fixed timeout value that will be used for all receiver
		transfers.  This is in units of system clock ticks (configurable).
		The special value of zero disables RX timeouts.  Default: 0

config AUDIO_I2SCHAR_TXTIMEOUT
	int "TX timeout"
	default 0
	---help---
		This is a fixed timeout value that will be used for all transmitter
		transfers.  This is in units of system clock ticks (configurable).
		The special value of zero disables RX timeouts.  Default: 0
