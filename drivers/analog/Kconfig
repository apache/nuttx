menuconfig ANALOG
	bool "Analog Device(ADC/DAC) Support"
	default n
	---help---
		This directory holds implementations of analog device drivers.
		This includes drivers for Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) as
		well as drivers for Digital to Analog Conversion (DAC).
		See include/nuttx/analog/*.h for registration information.

config ADC
	bool "Analog-to-Digital Conversion"
	default n
	---help---
		Select to enable support for analog input device support.  This includes
		not only Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC) but also amplifiers and
		analog multiplexers.

		This selection enables:

			- The upper half, device-independent ADC character driver, and
			- Selection of common lower half ADC drivers.

		MCU-specific, lower half drivers may be selected independently of
		CONFIG_ADC.  However, if CONFIG_ADC is selected, then it is assume
		that lower half ADC drivers will be used only with the common ADC
		upper half driver.

config ADC_FIFOSIZE
	int "ADC buffer size"
	default 8
	---help---
		This variable defines the size of the ADC ring buffer that is used
		to queue received ADC data until they can be retrieved by the
		application by reading from the ADC character device.  NOTE:  Since
		this is a ring buffer, the actual number of bytes that can be
		retained in buffer is (ADC_FIFOSIZE - 1).

		Enable driver to support Avia Semiconductor HX711 ADC
		designed for weight scales.

		Driver supports both 'a' and 'b' channels with 32, 64
		and 128 gain.

		Driver does not support continuous read and is not buffered.
		Driver uses interrupts to not hog the CPU while waiting
		for hx711 to be ready.

if ADC_HX711

config ADC_HA711_ADD_DELAY
	bool "Add 1us delay between clock pulses"
	default y if BOARD_LOOPSPERMSEC >= 15000
	---help---
		HX711 requires about 1us between clock pulses to work.
		This is not an issue on slower chips, but faster chips
		will most likely try to clock HX711 too fast, which
		will result in data lose.

		If this is enabled, code will insert 1us of delay to each
		clock change. Enable this only if you get data lose, or
		else you will just introduce unnecessary delay to your
		program.

		Best way to know if you need this, is to compile
		HX711 demo program and run it. If there are no errors
		reported during runtime, you can turn this of. If you
		see communication errors, then you should enable this.

config ADC_MCP3008_DIFFERENTIAL
	bool "Differential mode"
