menuconfig ANALOG
	bool "Analog Device(ADC/DAC) Support"
	default n
	---help---
		This directory holds implementations of analog device drivers.
		This includes drivers for Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) as
		well as drivers for Digital to Analog Conversion (DAC).
		See include/nuttx/analog/*.h for registration information.

if ANALOG

config ADC
	bool "Analog-to-Digital Conversion"
	default n
	---help---
		Select to enable support for analog input device support.  This includes
		not only Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC) but also amplifiers and
		analog multiplexers.

		This selection enables:

			- The upper half, device-independent ADC character driver, and
			- Selection of common lower half ADC drivers.

		MCU-specific, lower half drivers may be selected independently of
		CONFIG_ADC.  However, if CONFIG_ADC is selected, then it is assume
		that lower half ADC drivers will be used only with the common ADC
		upper half driver.

if ADC

config ADC_FIFOSIZE
	int "ADC buffer size"
	default 8
	---help---
		This variable defines the size of the ADC ring buffer that is used
		to queue received ADC data until they can be retrieved by the
		application by reading from the ADC character device.  NOTE:  Since
		this is a ring buffer, the actual number of bytes that can be
		retained in buffer is (ADC_FIFOSIZE - 1).

config ADC_NPOLLWAITERS
	int "Number of poll waiters"
	default 2
	---help---
		Maximum number of threads that can be waiting on poll.

config ADC_ADS1242
	bool "TI ADS1242 support"
	default n
	select SPI
	---help---
		Enable driver support for the ADS1242 24-Bit SPI powered ADC.

		This driver supports reading the ADC conversion result as well as
		configuring the ADC, setting the input channel, etc. is implemented
		via ioctl calls. However, it does not yet implement the standard ADC
		interface.

config ADC_ADS125X
	bool "TI ADS1255/ADS1256 support"
	default n
	select SPI
	select SCHED_HPWORK

endif # ADC_ADS125X

config ADC_LTC1867L
	bool "LTC 1863L/1867L support"
	default n
	select SPI
	---help---
		Enable driver support for the LTC 1863L (12 bit) and LTC 1867L (16 bit) SPI powered ADC.

		Note that the ADC conversion is started via the ANIOC_TRIGGER iotcl.

if ADC_LTC1867L

config LTC1867L_FREQUENCY
	int "LTC 1863L/1867L SPI frequency"
	default 1000000
	---help---
		LTC 1863L/1867L SPI frequency. Maximum is 20 MHz.

endif # ADC_LTC1867L

config ADC_PGA11X
	bool "TI PGA112/3/6/7 support"
	default n
	select SPI
	---help---
		Enables support for the  PGA112, PGA113, PGA116, PGA117 Zero-Drift
		PROGRAMMABLE GAIN AMPLIFIER with MUX

if ADC_PGA11X

config PGA11X_SPIFREQUENCY
	int "TI PGA112/3/6/7 SPI frequency"
	default 1000000
	---help---
		PGA11x SPI frequency.

config PGA11X_SPIMODE
	int "TI PGA112/3/6/7 SPI mode"
	default 0
	---help---
		PGA11x SPI mode.  The specification says that the device operates in Mode 0 or
		Mode 3.  But sometimes you need to tinker with this to get things to work
		correctly. Default:  Mode 0

config PGA11X_DAISYCHAIN
	bool "TI PGA112/3/6/7 daisy chain mode"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable support to use two PGA116/7's in Daisy Chain configuration.

config PGA11X_MULTIPLE
	bool "Multiple TI PGA112/3/6/7 support"
	default n
	depends on !PGA11X_DAISYCHAIN
	---help---
		Can be defined to support multiple PGA11X devices on board with separate
		chip selects (not daisy chained).  Each device will require a customized
		SPI interface to distinguish them when SPI_SELECT is called with
		devid=SPIDEV_MUX(n).

endif # if ADC_PGA11X

config ADC_ADS7828
	bool "TI ADS7828 support"
	default n
	select I2C
	---help---
		Enable driver support for the ADS7828 12-Bit I2C powered ADC.

		This driver supports reading single or multiple ADC conversion result
		as well as onfiguring the ADC, via ioctl calls.

if ADC_ADS7828

config ADS7828_FREQUENCY
	int "TI ADS7828 I2C frequency"
	default 100000
	---help---
		ADS7828 supports standard, fast, and high-speed I2C modes.

endif # ADC_ADS7828

config COMP
	bool "Analog Comparator"
	default n
	---help---
		Select to enable support for Analog Comparators (COMPs).

	---help---
		Select to enable support for Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs).

	select SPI

config DAC7571
	bool "DAC7571 support"
	default n
	select I2C
	---help---
		Enable driver support for the Texas Instruments DAC7571 dac.

config DAC7571_I2C_FREQUENCY
	int "DAC7571 I2C frequency"
	default 400000
	depends on DAC7571

	bool "DAC7554 support"
	default n
	select SPI
	---help---
		Enable driver support for the Texas Instruments DAC7554 dac.
