menuconfig ANALOG
	bool "Analog Device(ADC/DAC) Support"
	default n
	---help---
		This directory holds implementations of analog device drivers.
		This includes drivers for Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) as
		well as drivers for Digital to Analog Conversion (DAC).
		See include/nuttx/analog/*.h for registration information.

if ANALOG

config ADC
	bool "Analog-to-Digital Conversion"
	default n
	---help---
		Select to enable support for analog input device support.  This includes
		not only Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC) but also amplifiers and
		analog multiplexers.

		This selection enables:

			- The upper half, device-independent ADC character driver, and
			- Selection of common lower half ADC drivers.

		MCU-specific, lower half drivers may be selected independently of
		CONFIG_ADC.  However, if CONFIG_ADC is selected, then it is assume
		that lower half ADC drivers will be used only with the common ADC
		upper half driver.

if ADC

config ADC_FIFOSIZE
	int "ADC buffer size"
	default 8
	---help---
		This variable defines the size of the ADC ring buffer that is used
		to queue received ADC data until they can be retrieved by the
		application by reading from the ADC character device.  NOTE:  Since
		this is a ring buffer, the actual number of bytes that can be
		retained in buffer is (ADC_FIFOSIZE - 1).

config ADC_NPOLLWAITERS
	int "Number of poll waiters"
	default 2
	---help---
		Maximum number of threads that can be waiting on poll.

config ADC_ADS1242
	bool "TI ADS1242 support"
	default n
	select SPI
	---help---
		Enable driver support for the ADS1242 24-Bit SPI powered ADC.

		This driver supports reading the ADC conversion result as well as
		configuring the ADC, setting the input channel, etc. is implemented
		via ioctl calls. However, it does not yet implement the standard ADC
		interface.

		Note that the ADC conversion is started via the ANIOC_TRIGGER iotcl.

config PGA11X_SPIMODE
	int "TI PGA112/3/6/7 SPI mode"
	default 0
	---help---
		PGA11x SPI mode.  The specification says that the device operates in Mode 0 or
		Mode 3.  But sometimes you need to tinker with this to get things to work
		correctly. Default:  Mode 0

config PGA11X_DAISYCHAIN
	bool "TI PGA112/3/6/7 daisy chain mode"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable support to use two PGA116/7's in Daisy Chain configuration.

config PGA11X_MULTIPLE
	bool "Multiple TI PGA112/3/6/7 support"
	default n
	depends on !PGA11X_DAISYCHAIN
	---help---
		Can be defined to support multiple PGA11X devices on board with separate
		chip selects (not daisy chained).  Each device will require a customized
		SPI interface to distinguish them when SPI_SELECT is called with
		devid=SPIDEV_MUX(n).
