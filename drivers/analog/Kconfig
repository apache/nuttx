config ADC
	bool "Analog-to-Digital Conversion"
	default n
	---help---
		Select to enable support for analog input device support.  This includes
		not only Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC) but also amplifiers and
		analog multiplexers.

if ADC

config ADC_FIFOSIZE
	int "ADC buffer size"
	default 8
	---help---
		This variable defines the size of the ADC ring buffer that is used
		to queue received ADC data until they can be retrieved by the
		application by reading from the ADC character device.  NOTE:  Since
		this is a ring buffer, the actual number of bytes that can be
		retained in buffer is (ADC_FIFOSIZE - 1).

config ADC_NO_STARTUP_CONV
	bool "Do not start conversion when opening ADC device"
	default n
	depends on ARCH_CHIP_STM32
	---help---
		Do not start conversion when opening ADC device.

config ADC_ADS1242
	bool "TI ADS1242 support"
	default n
	select SPI
	---help---
		Enable driver support for the ADS1242 24-Bit SPI powered ADC.

		This driver supports reading the ADC conversion result as well as
		configuring the ADC, setting the input channel, etc. is implemented
		via ioctl calls. However, it does not yet implement the standard ADC
		interface.

config ADC_ADS125X
	bool "TI ADS1255/ADS1256 support"
	default n
	select SPI

if ADC_ADS125X

config ADS1255_FREQUENCY
	int "ADS1255/ADS1256 SPI frequency"
	default 1000000

endif # ADC_ADS125X

config ADC_PGA11X
	bool "TI PGA112/3/6/7 support"
	default n
	select SPI
	---help---
		Enables support for the  PGA112, PGA113, PGA116, PGA117 Zerø-Drift
		PROGRAMMABLE GAIN AMPLIFIER with MUX

if ADC_PGA11X

config PGA11X_SPIFREQUENCY
	int "TI PGA112/3/6/7 SPI frequency"
	default 1000000
	---help---
		PGA11x SPI frequency.

config PGA11X_SPIMODE
	int "TI PGA112/3/6/7 SPI mode"
	default 0
	---help---
		PGA11x SPI mode.  The specification says that the device operates in Mode 0 or
		Mode 3.  But sometimes you need to tinker with this to get things to work
		correctly. Default:  Mode 0

config PGA11X_DAISYCHAIN
	bool "TI PGA112/3/6/7 daisy chain mode"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable support to use two PGA116/7's in Daisy Chain configuration.

config PGA11X_MULTIPLE
	bool "Multiple TI PGA112/3/6/7 support"
	default n
	depends on !PGA11X_DAISYCHAIN
	---help---
		Can be defined to support multiple PGA11X devices on board with separate
		chip selects (not daisy chained).  Each device will require a customized
		SPI interface to distinguish them when SPI_SELECT is called with
		devid=SPIDEV_MUX.

endif # if ADC_PGA11X

config DAC
	bool "Digital-to-Analog Conversion"
	default n
	---help---
		Select to enable support for Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs).

if DAC

config DAC_AD5410
	bool "AD5410 support"
	default n
