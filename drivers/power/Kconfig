menuconfig PM
	bool "Power management (PM) system"
	default n
	---help---
		Power management (PM) system. It consists of an OS interface
		to board logic which can be used to obtain a recommended
		power level according to a power management policy set by the
		currently chosen PM governor. It is also used by drivers which
		can allow or not a power level to be changed or not.

if PM

config PM_NDOMAINS
	int "Number of PM activity domains"
	default 1
	---help---
		Defines the number of "domains" that the PM system can control.
		For example, you may want to separately manage the power from the
		Network domain, shutting down the network when it is not be used,
		from the UI domain, shutting down the UI when it is not in use.

config PM_GOVERNOR_GREEDY
	bool "Greedy governor"
	---help---
		This governor simply suggests the lowest-possible power state,
		considering any states locked by calls to pm_stay() (accessible
		via BOARDIOC_PM_STAY boardctl calls).

config PM_GOVERNOR_ACTIVITY
	bool "Activity based"
	---help---
		The activity based governor receives activity reports from drivers
		in units which are accumulated during a certain time slice interval.
		The governor will then switch between power states given a set of
		activity thresholds for each state.

menu "Governor options"

config PM_GOVERNOR_EXPLICIT_RELAX
	int "Stay initially at PM_NORMAL"
	default 0
	---help---
		If you boot into NSH, especially using the greedy PM governor, since
		NuttX will almost immediately go idle (when waiting for a prompt), the
		lowest possible run-level will be selected, which may not be desirable.
		This is not a problem if you directly run you application at boot, which
		can hold off power levels using pm_stay() (via boardctl).

		This option will initialize all run levels as if
		pm_stay/pm_stay_timeout() were to be called once for each.

		if set to -1, that means pm_stay(), so that your application
		needs to call pm_relax() (via boardctl()) for every run-level you
		wish to allow to enter.

		if set to timeout (unit: ms), that means pm_stay_timeout(ms).
		pm_relax() will be auto called after timeout.

if PM_GOVERNOR_ACTIVITY

config PM_GOVERNOR_SLICEMS
	int "PM time slice (msec)"
	default 100
	---help---
		The power management module collects activity counts in time slices.
		At the end of the time slice, the count accumulated during that
		interval is applied to an averaging algorithm to determine the
		activity level.

		CONFIG_PM_GOVERNOR_SLICEMS provides the duration of that time slice in
		milliseconds.  Default: 100 Milliseconds

config PM_GOVERNOR_MEMORY
	int "PM memory (msec)"
	default 2
	range 1 6
	---help---
		The averaging algorithm is simply: Y = (An*X + SUM(Ai*Yi))/SUM(Aj),
		where i = 1..n-1 and j= 1..n, n is the length of the "memory",
		Ai is the weight applied to each value, and X is the current
		activity.  These weights may be negative and a limited to the
		range of int16_t.

		  CONFIG_PM_GOVERNOR_MEMORY provides the memory for the algorithm.
		    Default: 2
		  CONFIG_PM_GOVERNOR_COEFn provides weight for each sample.  Default: 1

		Setting CONFIG_PM_GOVERNOR_MEMORY=1 disables all smoothing.
