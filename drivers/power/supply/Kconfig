config REGULATOR
	bool "Regulator core driver support"
	default n
	---help---
		The regulator core driver implements the uper layer framework that the lower
		layer driver can register with, and the common regulator APIs that are easy
		for other drivers to call for the control of their power supply.

config REGULATOR_GPIO
	bool "Regulator gpio driver support"
	default n
	---help---
		The regulator gpio driver implements the lower regulator ops that use gpio to
		control to regulator.

config REGULATOR_RPMSG
	bool "Regulator rpmsg driver support"
	depends on RPTUN
	default n
	---help---
		The rpmsg regulator driver implements the common regulator APIs, inside which
		the regulator operations are sent from the client to the remote device via
		the rpmsg channel. The remote device(namely server) is responsible for
		the parse and the completion.
