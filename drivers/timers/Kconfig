menuconfig RTC
	bool "RTC Driver Support"
	default n
	---help---
		This selection enables configuration of a real time clock (RTCdriver.
		See include/nuttx/timers/rtc.h for further RTC driver information.
		Most RTC drivers are MCU specific and may require other specific
		settings.

if RTC

config RTC_DATETIME
	bool "Date/Time RTC Support"
	default n
	---help---
		There are two general types of RTC:  (1) A simple battery backed
		counter that keeps the time when power is down, and (2) a full
		date / time RTC the provides the date and time information, often in
		BCD format.  If RTC_DATETIME is selected, it specifies this second kind
		of RTC. In this case, the RTC is used to "seed" the normal NuttX timer
		and the NuttX system timer provides for higher resolution time.

if !RTC_DATETIME

config RTC_HIRES
	bool "Hi-Res RTC Support"
	default n
	---help---
		If RTC_DATETIME not selected, then the simple, battery backed counter
		is used.  There are two different implementations of such simple
		counters based on the time resolution of the counter: The typical RTC
		keeps time to resolution of 1 second, usually supporting a 32-bit
		time_t value.  In this case, the RTC is used to "seed" the normal NuttX
		timer and the NuttX timer provides for higherresoution time.

		If RTC_HIRES is enabled in the NuttX configuration, then the RTC
		provides higher resolution time and completely replaces the system
		timer for purpose of date and time.

config RTC_FREQUENCY
	int "Hi-Res RTC frequency"
	default 1
	depends on RTC_HIRES
	---help---
		If RTC_HIRES is defined, then the frequency of the high resolution RTC
		must be provided.  If RTC_HIRES is not defined, RTC_FREQUENCY is
		assumed to be one Hz.

endif # !RTC_DATETIME

config RTC_ALARM
	bool "RTC Alarm Support"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable if the RTC hardware supports setting of an alarm.  A callback
		function will be executed when the alarm goes off.

config RTC_NALARMS
	int "Number of alarms"
	default 1
	depends on RTC_ALARM
	---help---
		Number of alarms supported by the hardware.

config RTC_DRIVER
	bool "RTC Driver Support"
	default n
	---help---
		This selection enables building of the "upper-half" RTC
		driver. See include/nuttx/timers/rtc.h for further RTC driver
		information.

if RTC_DRIVER

config RTC_ARCH
	bool "RTC Arch Implementation"
	default n
	---help---
		Implement RTC arch API on top of RTC driver interface.

config RTC_PERIODIC
	bool "RTC Periodic Interrupts"
	default n
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
		Add interrupt controls for RTCs that support periodic interrupts.

config RTC_ONESEC
	bool "RTC Once-per-second interrupts"
	default n
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
		Add interrupt controls for RTCs that support once-per-second interrupts.

config RTC_EPOCHYEAR
	bool "RTC epoch year"
	default n
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
		Add controls for RTCs that support epoch year settings.

		Many RTCs encode the year in an 8-bit register which is either interpreted
		as an 8-bit binary number or as a BCD number. In both cases, the number is
		interpreted relative to this RTC's Epoch. The RTC's Epoch is initialized to
		1900 on most systems but on Alpha and MIPS it might also be initialized to
		1952, 1980, or 2000, depending on the value of an RTC register for the year.
		With some RTCs, these operations can be used to read or to set the RTC's
		Epoch, respectively.

config RTC_IOCTL
	bool "RTC IOCTLs"
	default n
	---help---
		Support the RTC interface ioctl() method.  This allows you to add
		architecture-specific RTC operations to the RTC interface

endif # RTC_DRIVER

config RTC_EXTERNAL
	bool "External RTC Support"
	default n
	---help---
		In modern MCUs, the RTC is usually implement as an internal
		peripheral to the MCU.  An option is to use an external RTC
		connected to the MCU typically via SPI or I2C.

		If an external RTC is connect to the MCU through some bus, then the
		RTC will not be available to the system until after the system
		fully boots up and is able to access the bus.  In that case, this
		setting must be included to suppress attempts to initialize the RTC
		early in the boot sequence.
