 * Name: nx_mkfifo
 *
 * Description:
 *   nx_mkfifo() makes a FIFO device driver file with name 'pathname.' Unlike
 *   Linux, a NuttX FIFO is not a special file type but simply a device
 *   driver instance.  'mode' specifies the FIFO's permissions.
 *
 *   Once the FIFO has been created by nx_mkfifo(), any thread can open it
 *   for reading or writing, in the same way as an ordinary file. However, it
 *   must have been opened from both reading and writing before input or
 *   output can be performed.  This FIFO implementation will block all
 *   attempts to open a FIFO read-only until at least one thread has opened
 *   the FIFO for  writing.
 *
 *   If all threads that write to the FIFO have closed, subsequent calls to
 *   read() on the FIFO will return 0 (end-of-file).
 *
 *   NOTE: nx_mkfifo is a special, non-standard, NuttX-only interface.  Since
 *   the NuttX FIFOs are based in in-memory, circular buffers, the ability
 *   to control the size of those buffers is critical for system tuning.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   pathname - The full path to the FIFO instance to attach to or to create
 *     (if not already created).
 *   mode - Ignored for now
 *   bufsize - The size of the in-memory, circular buffer in bytes.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   0 is returned on success; otherwise, the negative error code return
 *   appropriately.
 *
