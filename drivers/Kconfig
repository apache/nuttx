	bool "Date/Time RTC Support"
	default n
	---help---
		There are two general types of RTC:  (1) A simple battery backed
		counter that keeps the time when power is down, and (2) a full
		date / time RTC the provides the date and time information, often in
		BCD format.  If RTC_DATETIME is selected, it specifies this second kind
		of RTC. In this case, the RTC is used to "seed" the normal NuttX timer
		and the NuttX system timer provides for higher resolution time.

if !RTC_DATETIME

config RTC_HIRES
	bool "Hi-Res RTC Support"
	default n
	---help---
		If RTC_DATETIME not selected, then the simple, battery backed counter
		is used.  There are two different implementations of such simple
		counters based on the time resolution of the counter: The typical RTC
		keeps time to resolution of 1 second, usually supporting a 32-bit
		time_t value.  In this case, the RTC is used to "seed" the normal NuttX
		timer and the NuttX timer provides for higherresoution time.

		If RTC_HIRES is enabled in the NuttX configuration, then the RTC
		provides higher resolution time and completely replaces the system
		timer for purpose of date and time.

config RTC_FREQUENCY
	int "Hi-Res RTC frequency"
	default 1
	depends on RTC_HIRES
	---help---
		If RTC_HIRES is defined, then the frequency of the high resolution RTC
