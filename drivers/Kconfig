config CAN_TXREADY
	bool "can_txready interface"
	default n
	select SCHED_WORKQUEUE
	---help---
		This selection enables the can_txready() interface.  This interface
		is needed only for CAN hardware that supports queing of outgoing
		messages in a H/W FIFO.

		The CAN upper half driver also supports a queue of output messages
		in a S/W FIFO.  Messages are added to that queue when when
		can_write() is called and removed from the queue in can_txdone()
		when each TX message is complete.

		After each message is added to the S/W FIFO, the CAN upper half
		driver will attempt to send the message by calling into the lower
		half driver.  That send will not be performed if the lower half
		driver is busy, i.e., if dev_txready() returns false.  In that
		case, the number of messages in the S/W FIFO can grow.  If the
		S/W FIFO becomes full, then can_write() will wait for space in
		the S/W FIFO.

		If the CAN hardware does not support a H/W FIFO then busy means
		that the hardware is actively sending the message and is
		guaranteed to become non busy (i.e, dev_txready()) when the
		send transfer completes and can_txdone() is called.  So the call
		to can_txdone() means that the transfer has completed and also
		that the hardware is ready to accept another transfer.

		If the CAN hardware supports a H/W FIFO, can_txdone() is not
		called when the tranfer is complete, but rather when the
		transfer is queued in the H/W FIFO.  When the H/W FIFO becomes
		full, then dev_txready() will report false and the number of
		queued messages in the S/W FIFO will grow.

		There is no mechanism in this case to inform the upper half
		driver when the hardware is again available, when there is
		again space in the H/W FIFO.  can_txdone() will not be called
		again.  If the S/W FIFO becomes full, then the upper half
		driver will wait for space to become available, but there is
		no event to awaken it and the driver will hang.

		Enabling this feature adds support for the can_txready()
		interface.  This function is called from the lower half
		driver's CAN interrupt handler each time a TX transfer
		completes.  This is a sure indication that the H/W FIFO is
		no longer full.  can_txready() will then awaken the
		can_write() logic and the hang condition is avoided.
