config DISABLE_POLL

		The sizes of drivers can be reduced if the poll() method is not
		supported.  If you do not use poll() or select(), then you can
		select DISABLE_POLL to reduce the code footprint by a small amount.

		This selection disables the poll() interface as well as interfaces
		the derive from poll() such as select().

config DEV_URANDOM
	bool "Enable /dev/urandom"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable support for /dev/urandom provided by either a hardware TRNG or
		by a software PRNG implementation.

		NOTE:  This option may not be cryptographially secure and should not
		be enabled if you are concerned about cyptographically secure
		pseudo-random numbers (CPRNG) and do not know the characteristics
		of the software PRNG impelementation!

	---help---
		Use the same congruential general used with srand().  This algorithm
		is computationally more intense and uses double precision floating

		requires that you also select CONFIG_LIB_RAND_ORDER > 2

config DEV_URANDOM_RANDOM_POOL
	bool "Entropy pool"
	depends on CRYPTO_RANDOM_POOL
	---help---
		Use the entropy pool CPRNG output for urandom algorithm.

		NOTE: May or may not be cyptographically secure, depending upon the

config DEV_URANDOM_ARCH
	bool "Architecture-specific"
	depends on ARCH_HAVE_RNG
	---help---
		The implementation of /dev/urandom is provided in archtecture-
		specific logic using hardware TRNG logic.  architecture-specific
		logic must provide the whole implementation in this case, including
		the function devurandom_register().  In this case, /dev/urandom may
		refer to the same driver as /dev/random.

		NOTE: May or may not be cyptographically secure, depending upon the
		implementation.
