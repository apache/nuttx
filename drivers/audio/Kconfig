config AUDIO_I2SCHAR
	bool "I2S character driver (for testing only)
	default n
	depends on I2S
	---help---
		This selection enables a simple character driver that supports I2S
		transfers via a read() and write().  The intent of this driver is to
		support I2S testing.  It is not an audio driver but does conform to
		some of the buffer management heuristics of an audio driver.  It is
		not suitable for use in any real driver application in its current
		form.

config VS1053
	bool "VS1053 codec chip"
	default n
	---help---
		Select to enable support for the VS1053 Audio codec by VLSI Solutions.
		This chip provides encoding and decoding of MP3, WMA, AAC and Ogg
		Vorbis format audio.  It also has a general DSP which is user
		programmable to perform special audio (or any DSP) functions.

if VS1053

config VS1053_DEVICE_COUNT
	int "Number of VS1053 devices attached"
	default 1
	---help---
		Sets the number of VS1053 type devices availalbe to the system.
		This is required to reserve global, static lower-half driver
		context pointers for the DREQ ISR to use for lookup when it needs
		to signal that additional data is being requested.

if AUDIO_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_BUFFERS

config VS1053_NUM_BUFFERS
	int "Number of Audio Pipeline Buffers to use"
	default 2
	---help---
		Sets the number of the Audio Pipeline Buffers used to deliver audio
		data to the VS1053 driver.  The minimum you should set this is
		2 buffers, which should be adequate for most media types.

config VS1053_BUFFER_SIZE
	int "Size of Audio Pipeline Buffers to use"
	default 8192
	---help---
		Sets the size of the Audio Pipeline Buffers used to deliver audio
		data to the VS1053 driver.  The minimum you should set this is
		2048 bytes.  The larger the buffer, the better CPU performance.
