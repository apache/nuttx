menuconfig MTD
	bool "Memory Technology Device (MTD) Support"
	default n
	---help---
		Memory Technology Device (MTD) drivers.  Some simple drivers for
		memory technologies like FLASH, EEPROM, NVRAM, etc.  See
		include/nuttx/mtd/mtd.h

		(Note: This is a simple memory interface and should not be
		confused with the "real" MTD developed at infradead.org.  This
		logic is unrelated; I just used the name MTD because I am not
		aware of any other common way to refer to this class of devices).

config MTD_PARTITION
	bool "Support MTD partitions"
	default n
	---help---
		MTD partitions are build as MTD drivers that manage a sub-region
		of the FLASH memory.  The contain the original FLASH MTD driver and
		simply manage all accesses to assure that (1) FLASH accesses are
		always offset to the beginning of the partition, and (2) that FLASH
		accesses do not extend outside of the partition.

		A FLASH device may be broken up into several partitions managed,
		each managed by a separate MTD driver.  The MTD partition interface
		is described in:

			include/nuttx/mtd/mtd.h
			FAR struct mtd_dev_s *mtd_partition(FAR struct mtd_dev_s *mtd, off_t offset, off_t nblocks);

		Each call to mtd_partition() will create a new MTD driver instance
		managing the sub-region of flash beginning at 'offset' (in blocks)
		and of size 'nblocks' on the device specified by 'mtd'.

config MTD_CONFIG_RAM_CONSOLIDATE
	bool "Always use RAM consolidation method (work in progress)"
	default n
	---help---
		When the MTD device used for /dev/config contains more than one
		erase block, the "unused entry" consolidation reserves one erase
		block by default for cleanup purposes.  This consumes the minimum
		amount of RAM, however it "wastes" one erase block on the device.
		(For configurations that have only a single erase block assigned
		to the config device, RAM consolidation is the ONLY option.)

		Another approach is to allow the driver to use the entire MTD
		device (or partition) to save config data, and then allocate a
		RAM buffer (the size of one erase block) to perform the
		consolidation.  Enabling this feature basically trades off RAM
		usage for FLASH usage.  If the MTD device used for config data
		has small erase sizes (4K, etc.) and there is plenty of free RAM
		available, then this is probably a good option.

		Another benefit of this option is it reduces code space a bit
		since the "reserved block" consolidate routine is not needed.

		Reduces RAM usage in the SMART MTD layer by replacing the 1-for-1 logical to
		physical sector map with a smaller cache-based structure.  This can save a
		considerable amount of RAM on devices with a large sector count, but at the
		expense of increased read/write times when a cache miss occurs.  If the

		larger number allows larger files to be "seek"ed randomly without encountering
