menuconfig RMT
	bool "RMT (Remote Control) Driver Support"
	default n
	---help---
		This option selects common RMT (Remote Control) options and should be
		enabled by the platforms that implement a Remote Control Peripheral.

if RMT

config RMTCHAR
	bool "RMT character driver (for testing only)"
	default n
	---help---
		The RMT character driver is a simple character driver that supports
		RMT transfers via read() and write(). This driver is primarily
		intended to support RMT testing. It is not suitable for use in any
		real driver application in its current form because its buffer
		management heuristics are dependent on the lower half driver
		(device-specific). Applications that use the RMT peripheral to
		implement protocols such as NEC (for Remote Control), or use this
		driver to implement other 1-wire protocols such as WS2812 LED must
		provide their specific driver implementation.

config RMT_DEFAULT_RX_BUFFER_SIZE
	int "Default RX buffer size"
	default 100
	---help---
		The RMT RX default buffer size. This is the expected buffer size
		that should be returned on a `read()` operation.

config RMT_LOOP_TEST_MODE
	bool "RMT character driver loopback test mode (for testing only)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
	---help---
		This enables a lower-half driver-specific loopback test
		mode that attaches the transmitter to the receiver, being
		able to test the RMT peripheral without any external
		connection. This feature depends on lower-half driver
		implementation.
