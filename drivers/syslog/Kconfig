config RAMLOG
	bool "RAM log device support"
	default n
	---help---
		This is a driver that was intended to support debugging output,
		aka syslogging, when the normal serial output is not available.
		For example, if you are using a telnet or USB serial console,
		the debug output will get lost.  However, the RAMLOG device should
		be usable even if system logging is disabled.

		This driver is similar to a pipe in that it saves the debugging
		output in a FIFO in RAM.  It differs from a pipe in numerous
		details as needed to support logging.

if RAMLOG
config RAMLOG_BUFSIZE
	int "RAMLOG buffer size"
	default 1024
	depends on RAMLOG_SYSLOG
	---help---
		Size of the console RAM log.  Default: 1024

config RAMLOG_CRLF
	bool "RAMLOG CR/LF"
	default n
	---help---
		Pre-pend a carriage return before every linefeed that goes into the
		RAM log.

config RAMLOG_NONBLOCKING
	bool "RAMLOG non-block reads"
	default y
	---help---
		Reading from the RAMLOG will never block if the RAMLOG is empty.  If the RAMLOG
		is empty, then zero is returned (usually interpreted as end-of-file).

config RAMLOG_NPOLLWAITERS
	int "RAMLOG number of poll waiters"
	default 4
	---help---
		The maximum number of threads that may be waiting on the poll method.

config RAMLOG_OVERWRITE
	bool "RAMLOG overwrite circular buffer"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable overwrite of circular buffer. If RAMLOG buffer overflows,
		overwrite it from the top of buffer and always keep the latest log.

endif

config SYSLOG_BUFFER
	bool "Use buffered output"
	default n
	depends on SYSLOG_WRITE
	select MM_IOB
	---help---
		Enables an buffering logic that will be used to serialize debug
		output from concurrent tasks. This enables allocation of one buffer
		per thread, each of size CONFIG_IOB_BUFSIZE.

		The use of SYSLOG buffering is optional.  If not enabled, however,
		then the output from multiple tasks that attempt to generate SYSLOG
		output may be interleaved and difficult to read.

config SYSLOG_INTBUFFER
	bool "Use interrupt buffer"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables an interrupt buffer that will be used to serialize debug
		output from interrupt handlers.

config SYSLOG_INTBUFSIZE
	int "Interrupt buffer size"
	default 512
	depends on SYSLOG_INTBUFFER
	---help---
		The size of the interrupt buffer in bytes.

config SYSLOG_TIMESTAMP
	bool "Prepend timestamp to syslog message"
	default n
	---help---
		Prepend timestamp to syslog message.

config SYSLOG_TIMESTAMP_REALTIME
	bool "Use wall-clock for syslog timestamp"
	default n
	depends on SYSLOG_TIMESTAMP
	---help---
		Use wall-clock (CLOCK_REALTIME) for timestamp.  By default,
		CLOCK_MONOTONIC, if enabled, will be used or the system timer
		is not.

config SYSLOG_PREFIX
	bool "Prepend prefix to syslog message"
	default n
	---help---
		Prepend prefix to syslog message.

config SYSLOG_PREFIX_STRING
	string "Prefix string"
	depends on SYSLOG_PREFIX
	default ""
	---help---
		The prefix string to be prepend.

	prompt "System log device"
	default SYSLOG_CONSOLE if !ARCH_LOWPUTC
	default SYSLOG_DEFAULT if ARCH_LOWPUTC
	depends on !ARCH_SYSLOG

config SYSLOG_CHAR
	bool "Log to a character device"
	select SYSLOG_WRITE
	---help---
		Enable the generic character device for the SYSLOG. The full path to the
		SYSLOG device is provided by SYSLOG_DEVPATH. A valid character device (or
		file) must exist at this path.  It will by opened by syslog_initialize.

config RAMLOG_SYSLOG
	bool "Use RAMLOG for SYSLOG"
	depends on RAMLOG && !ARCH_SYSLOG
	---help---
		Use the RAM logging device for the syslogging interface.  If this
		feature is enabled (along with SYSLOG), then all debug output (only)
		will be re-directed to the circular buffer in RAM.  This RAM log can
		be viewed from NSH using the 'dmesg' command.

config SYSLOG_CONSOLE
	bool "Log to /dev/console"
	depends on DEV_CONSOLE
	select SYSLOG_WRITE
	---help---
		Use the system console as a SYSLOG output device.

config SYSLOG_RPMSG
	bool "Log to RPMSG"
	depends on OPENAMP
	depends on SCHED_WORKQUEUE
	select SYSLOG_WRITE
	---help---
		Use the rpmsg as a SYSLOG output device, send message to remote proc.

config SYSLOG_DEFAULT
	bool "Default SYSLOG device"
	---help---
		syslog() interfaces will be present, but all output will go to the
		up_putc(ARCH_LOWPUTC == y) or bit-bucket(ARCH_LOWPUTC == n).

config SYSLOG_RPMSG_WORK_DELAY
	int "SYSLOG RPMSG work delay(ms)"
	default 100
	depends on SYSLOG_RPMSG

config SYSLOG_RPMSG_SERVER
	bool "Enable RPMSG server for SYSLOG"
	default n
	depends on OPENAMP
	---help---
		Use rpmsg to receive message from remote proc.

config SYSLOG_FILE
	bool "Syslog file output"
	default n
	select SYSLOG_WRITE
	---help---
		Build in support to use a file to collect SYSLOG output.  File SYSLOG
		channels differ from other SYSLOG channels in that they cannot be
		established until after fully booting and mounting the target file
		system.  The function syslog_file_channel() would need to be called
		from board-specific bring-up logic AFTER mounting the file system
		containing 'devpath'.

		NOTE interrupt level SYSLOG output will be lost in this case unless
		the interrupt buffer is used.

config CONSOLE_SYSLOG
	bool "Use SYSLOG for /dev/console"
	default n
	depends on DEV_CONSOLE && !SYSLOG_CONSOLE
	---help---
		Use the syslog logging device as a system console. If this feature is
		enabled (along with DEV_CONSOLE), then all console output will be
		re-directed to syslog output (syslog_putc). This is useful, for
		example, if the only console is a Telnet console.  Then in that case,
		console output from non-Telnet threads will go to the syslog output.

config SYSLOG_CHAR_CRLF
	bool "SYSLOG device CR/LF"
	default y
	depends on SYSLOG_CHAR
	---help---
		Pre-pend a carriage return before every linefeed that goes to the
		character device.

config SYSLOG_DEVPATH
	string "System log device"
	default "/dev/ttyS1"
	depends on SYSLOG_CHAR
	---help---
		The full path to the system logging device.  For the RAMLOG SYSLOG device,
		this is normally "/dev/ramlog".  For character SYSLOG devices, it should be
		some other existing character device (or file) supported by the configuration
		(such as "/dev/ttyS1")/

config SYSLOG_CHARDEV
	bool "SYSLOG character device"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables support for a simple character driver at /dev/syslog whose
		write() method will transfer data to the SYSLOG device.  This can be
		useful if, for example, you want to redirect the output of a program
		to the SYSLOG.

		NOTE that unlike other syslog output, this data is unformatted raw
		byte output with no time-stamping or any other SYSLOG features
		supported.
