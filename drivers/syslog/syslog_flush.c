 * Name: syslog_flush
 *
 * Description:
 *   This is called by system crash-handling logic.  It must flush any
 *   buffered data to the SYSLOG device.
 *
 *   Interrupts are disabled at the time of the crash and this logic must
 *   perform the flush using low-level, non-interrupt driven logic.
 *
 *   REVISIT:  There is an implementation problem in that if a character
 *   driver is the underlying device, then there is no mechanism to flush
 *   the data buffered in the driver with interrupts disabled.
 *
 *   Currently, this function on (a) dumps the interrupt buffer (if the
 *   SYSLOG interrupt buffer is enabled), and (b) only the SYSLOG interface
 *   supports supports the 'sc_force()' method.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   ch - The character to add to the SYSLOG (must be positive).
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK)is returned on  success.  A negated errno value is returned
 *   on any failure.
