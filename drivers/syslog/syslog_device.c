 * (2) While the device is being initialized.  The case could happen if
 *     debug output is generated while syslog_dev_initialize() executes
 *     (SYSLOG_INITIALIZING).
 * (3) While we are generating SYSLOG output.  The case could happen if
 *     debug output is generated while syslog_dev_putc() executes
 *     (This case is actually handled inside of syslog_semtake()).
 * (4) Any debug output generated from interrupt handlers.  A disadvantage
 *     of using the generic character device for the SYSLOG is that it
 *     cannot handle debug output generated from interrupt level handlers.
 * (5) Any debug output generated from the IDLE loop.  The character
 *     driver interface is blocking and the IDLE thread is not permitted
 *     to block.
 * (6) If any failure occurred during output.  In this case, we properly
 *     close the device, and set it for later re-opening.
 *
 * NOTE: That the third case is different.  It applies only to the thread
 * that currently holds the sl_sem semaphore.  Other threads should wait.
 * that is why that case is handled in syslog_semtake().
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   syslog_dev  - Handle to syslog device to be used.

 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success; a negated errno value is returned on

 *   devpath - The full path to the character device to be used.
 *   oflags  - File open flags.
 *   mode    - File open mode (only if oflags include O_CREAT).
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Returns a newly created SYSLOG channel, or NULL in case of any failure.

 * Name: syslog_dev_uninitialize

 * Description:
 *   Disable the last device/file channel in preparation to use a different

 * Input Parameters:
 *   channel    - Handle to syslog channel to be used.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success; a negated errno value is returned on
 *   any failure.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   The caller has already switched the SYSLOG source to some safe channel
 *   (the default channel).
