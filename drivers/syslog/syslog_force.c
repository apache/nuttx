 * Name: syslog_force
 *
 * Description:
 *   This is the low-level system logging interface.  This version forces
 *   the output and is only used in emergency situations (e.g., in assertion
 *   handling).
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   ch - The character to add to the SYSLOG (must be positive).
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, the character is echoed back to the caller. A negated errno
 *   value is returned on any failure.
