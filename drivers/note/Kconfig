menuconfig DRIVER_NOTE
	bool "Note Driver Support"
	depends on SCHED_INSTRUMENTATION
	default n

if DRIVER_NOTE

config DRIVER_NOTE_MAX
	int "Maximum number of sched_note drivers"
	default 1
	---help---
		sched_note supports the maximum number of drivers

choice
	prompt "Note driver selection"
	default DRIVER_NOTERAM

config DRIVER_NOTERAM
	bool "Note RAM driver"
	depends on !SCHED_INSTRUMENTATION_CSECTION && (!SCHED_INSTRUMENTATION_SPINLOCK || !SMP)
	---help---
		If this option is selected, then in-memory buffering logic is
		enabled to capture scheduler instrumentation data.  This has
		the advantage that (1) the platform logic does not have to provide
		the sched_note_* interfaces described for the previous settings.
		Instead, the buffering logic catches all of these.  It encodes
		timestamps the scheduler note and adds the note to an in-memory,
		circular buffer.  And (2) buffering the scheduler instrumentation
		data (versus performing some output operation) minimizes the impact
		of the instrumentation on the behavior of the system. If the in-memory
		buffer becomes full, then older notes are overwritten by newer notes.

		A character driver is provided which can be used by an application
		to read data from the in-memory, scheduler instrumentation "note"
		buffer.

		NOTE: This option is not available if critical sections are being
		monitored (nor if spinlocks are being monitored in SMP configuration)
		because there would be a logical error in the design in those cases.
		That error is that these interfaces call enter_ and leave_critical_section
		(which use spinlocks in SMP mode).  That means that each call to
		sched_note_get() causes several additional entries to be added from
		the note buffer in order to remove one entry.

config DRIVER_NOTEARCH
	bool "Note Arch driver"
	---help---
		The note driver is provided by arch specific code.

config DRIVER_NOTELOG
	bool "Note syslog driver"
	select SCHED_INSTRUMENTATION_EXTERNAL
	---help---
		The note driver output to syslog.

config SEGGER_SYSVIEW
	bool "Note SEGGER SystemView driver"
	select SEGGER_RTT
	select SCHED_INSTRUMENTATION_EXTERNAL
	---help---
		SystemView is a real-time recording and visualization tool for embedded
		systems that reveals the true runtime behavior of an application,
		going far deeper than the system insights provided by debuggers. This is
		particularly effective when developing and working with complex embedded
		systems comprising multiple threads and interrupts. SystemView can ensure
		unintended interactions and resource conflicts.

config DRIVER_NOTERAM_BUFSIZE
	int "Note RAM buffer size"
	depends on DRIVER_NOTERAM
	default 2048
	---help---
		The size of the in-memory, circular instrumentation buffer (in bytes).

config DRIVER_NOTERAM_TASKNAME_BUFSIZE
	int "Note RAM task name buffer size"
	depends on DRIVER_NOTERAM
	default 256 if TASK_NAME_SIZE > 0
	default 0 if TASK_NAME_SIZE = 0
	---help---
		The size of the in-memory task name buffer (in bytes).
		The buffer is used to hold the name of the task during instrumentation.
		Trace dump can find and show a task name corresponding to given pid in
		the instrumentation data by using this buffer.
		If 0 is specified, this feature is disabled and trace dump shows only
		the name of the newly created task.

config DRIVER_NOTERAM_DEFAULT_NOOVERWRITE
	bool "Disable overwrite by default"
	depends on DRIVER_NOTERAM
	default n
	---help---
		Disables overwriting old notes in the circular buffer when the buffer
		is full by default. This is useful to keep instrumentation data of the
		beginning of a system boot.

config DRIVER_NOTECTL
	bool "Scheduler instrumentation filter control driver"
	default n
	depends on SCHED_INSTRUMENTATION_FILTER
	---help---
		If this option is selected, the instrumentation filter control device
		/dev/notectl is provided.
