config DRIVER_NOTERAM
	bool "Note RAM driver"
	depends on !SCHED_INSTRUMENTATION_CSECTION && (!SCHED_INSTRUMENTATION_SPINLOCK || !SMP)
	---help---
		If this option is selected, then in-memory buffering logic is
		enabled to capture scheduler instrumentation data.  This has
		the advantage that (1) the platform logic does not have to provide
		the sched_note_* interfaces described for the previous settings.
		Instead, the buffering logic catches all of these.  It encodes
		timestamps the scheduler note and adds the note to an in-memory,
		circular buffer.  And (2) buffering the scheduler instrumentation
		data (versus performing some output operation) minimizes the impact
		of the instrumentation on the behavior of the system. If the in-memory
		buffer becomes full, then older notes are overwritten by newer notes.

		A character driver is provided which can be used by an application
		to read data from the in-memory, scheduler instrumentation "note"
		buffer.

		NOTE: This option is not available if critical sections are being
		monitor (nor if spinlocks are being monitored in SMP configuration)
		because there would be a logical error in the design in those cases.
		That error is that these interfaces call enter_ and leave_critical_section
		(and which us spinlocks in SMP mode).  That means that each call to
		sched_note_get() causes several additional entries to be added from
		the note buffer in order to remove one entry.

config DRIVER_NOTEARCH
	bool "Note Arch driver"
	---help---
		The note driver is provided by arch specific code.

config DRIVER_NOTERAM_BUFSIZE
	int "Note RAM buffer size"
	depends on DRIVER_NOTERAM
	default 2048
	---help---
		The size of the in-memory, circular instrumentation buffer (in bytes).

config DRIVER_NOTERAM_TASKNAME_BUFSIZE
	int "Note RAM task name buffer size"
	depends on DRIVER_NOTERAM
	default 256 if TASK_NAME_SIZE > 0
	default 0 if TASK_NAME_SIZE = 0
	---help---
		The size of the in-memory task name buffer (in bytes).
		The buffer is used to hold the name of the task during instrumentation.
		Trace dump can find and show a task name corresponding to given pid in
		the instrumentation data by using this buffer.
		If 0 is specified, this feature is disabled and trace dump shows only
		the name of the newly created task.

config DRIVER_NOTERAM_DEFAULT_NOOVERWRITE
	bool "Disable overwrite by default"
	depends on DRIVER_NOTERAM
	default n
	---help---
		Disables overwriting old notes in the circular buffer when the buffer
		is full by default. This is useful to keep instrumentation data of the
		beginning of a system boot.

config DRIVER_NOTECTL
	bool "Scheduler instrumentation filter control driver"
	default n
	depends on SCHED_INSTRUMENTATION_FILTER
	---help---
		If this option is selected, the instrumentation filter control device
		/dev/notectl is provided.
