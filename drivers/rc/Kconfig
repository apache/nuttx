		We test RC driver architecture by dummy rc device.
		Test Item: 1. Test all the IOCTL commands; 2. Test all API interface,
                ex: tx_ir, tx_scancode; 3. We use the way of workqueue to periodically
		feed data to the downstream buffer(userspace->kernelspace) to simulate
		reading data from IR device; 4. Write IR data to device by tx_ir/tx_scancode
		to simulate as remote control.
