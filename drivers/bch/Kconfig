	bool "Block-to-Character (BCH) Support"
	default n
	---help---
		Contains logic that may be used to convert a block driver into
		a character driver.  This is the complementary conversion as that
		performed by loop.c.  See include/nuttx/drivers/drivers.h for
		registration information.

config BCH_ENCRYPTION
	bool "Enable BCH encryption"
	default n

config BCH_ENCRYPTION_KEY_SIZE
	int "AES key size"
	default 16

config BCH_BUFFER_ALIGNMENT
	int "Buffer aligned bytes"

config BCH_DEVICE_READONLY
	bool "Set BCH device readonly"
	default n
	---help---
		Set bch devices read-only

config BCH_FORCE_INDIRECT
	bool "Force indirect transfers in BCH"
	default n
	---help---
		Force all data transfers in BCH to be indirect,
		using an intermediate buffer.
		This is needed because in some use cases (e.g. when CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL)
		it is not possible to write directly from user buffer.
