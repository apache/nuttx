	bool "TI ADS7843/TSC2046 touchscreen controller"
	default n
	select SPI
	---help---
		Enable support for the TI/Burr-Brown ADS7842 touchscreen controller.  I believe

		value provided by this setting.

config ADS7843E_SPIMODE
	int "SPI mode"
	default 0
	range 0 3
	---help---
		Controls the SPI mode.  The device should work in mode 0, but

config ADS7843E_FREQUENCY
	int "SPI frequency"
	default 100000
	---help---
		Define to use a different SPI bus frequency.

config ADS7843E_THRESHX
	int "X threshold"
	default 12
	---help---
		New touch positions will only be reported when the X or Y data changes by these
		thresholds. This trades reduced data rates for some loss in dragging accuracy.  For
		12-bit values the raw ranges are 0-4095. So for example, if your display is
		320x240, then THRESHX=13 and THRESHY=17 would correspond to one pixel.  Default: 12

config ADS7843E_THRESHY
	int "Y threshold"
	default 12
	---help---
		New touch positions will only be reported when the X or Y data changes by these
		thresholds. This trades reduced data rates for some loss in dragging accuracy.  For
		12-bit values the raw ranges are 0-4095. So for example, if your display is

config MXT_THRESHX
	int "X threshold"
	default 5
	---help---
		New touch positions will only be reported when the X or Y data
		changes by these thresholds. This trades reduced data rates for some
		loss in dragging accuracy.  For 12-bit values the raw ranges are
		0-4095. So for example, if your display is 800x480, then THRESHX=5
		and THRESHY=8 would correspond to a one pixel change. Default: 5

		NOTE: This does nothing to reduce the interrupt rate.  It only
		reduces the rate at which touch events are reports.

config MXT_THRESHY
	int "Y threshold"
	default 8
	---help---
		New touch positions will only be reported when the X or Y data
		changes by these thresholds. This trades reduced data rates for some

config MXT_NPOLLWAITERS
	int "Number poll waiters"
	default 4
	depends on !DISABLE_POLL
	---help---
		Maximum number of threads that can be waiting on poll()

config MXT_DISABLE_DEBUG_VERBOSE
	bool "Disable verbose debug output"
	default y
	depends on DEBUG_VERBOSE && DEBUG_INPUT
	---help---
		The maXTouch tends to generate interrupts at a high rate during the
		contact.  If verbose debug is enabled in this driver, you may not
		be able to get anything done because of the high debug output rate.

		This setting will allow you to keep verbose touchscreen debug output
		in other modules, but to specifically suppress the debug out from
		the MXT driver.  Debug (non-verbose) errors will still be generated,
		but the chit-chat level will be eliminated.

	bool "Active Low Interrupt"
	default n
	---help---
		The STMPE811 interrupt is provided by a discrete input (usually a
		GPIO interrupt on most MCU architectures).  This setting determines
		whether the interrupt is active high (or rising edge triggered) or

		high/rising edge.

config STMPE811_EDGE
	bool "Edge triggered Interrupt"
	default n
	---help---
		The STMPE811 interrupt is provided by a discrete input (usually a

		STMPE811 touchscreen data comes in a a very high rate.  New touch positions
		will only be reported when the X or Y data changes by these thresholds.

config DJOYSTICK
	bool "Discrete Joystick"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable standard discrete joystick upper half driver.  A discrete

		with GPIO input pins.  So up, down, left, and right are all discrete
