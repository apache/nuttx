config USBDEV_ISOCHRONOUS
	bool "Enable isochronous"
	default n
	---help---
		Build in extra support for isochronous endpoints

config USBDEV_DUALSPEED
	bool "Enable high and full speed"
	default n
	---help---
		Hardware handles high and full speed operation (USB 2.0)

choice USBDEV_POWERED
	prompt "Select USB device powered"
	default USBDEV_SELFPOWERED

config USBDEV_SELFPOWERED
	bool "Self powered"
	---help---
		Will cause USB features to indicate that the device is self-powered

config USBDEV_BUSPOWERED
	bool "Bus powered"
	---help---
		Will cause USB features to indicate that the device is self-powered

endchoice

config USBDEV_MAXPOWER
	int "Maximum power consumption in mA"
	default 100
#	depends on USBDEV_BUSPOWERED
	---help---
		Maximum power consumption in mA.  This selection should only apply if
		the device is bus powered (USBDEV_BUSPOWERED).  It is, however, used
		unconditionally in several USB device drivers.

config USBDEV_DMA
	bool "Enable DMA methods"
	default n
	---help---
		Select this enable DMA-related methods in USB device controller driver
		interface.  These methods include the DMA buffer allocation methods:
		allobuffer() and freebuffer().

		The USB class driver allocates packet I/O buffers for data transfer by
		calling the driver allocbuffer() and freebuffer() methods.  Those methods
		are only available if USBDEV_DMA is defined in the system configuration.

config USBDEV_DMAMEMORY
bool "Board DMA Allocation Hooks"
	default n
	depends on USBDEV_DMA
	---help---
		The USB class driver allocates packet I/O buffers for data transfer by
		calling the driver allocbuffer() and freebuffer() methods.  Those methods
		are only available if USBDEV_DMA is defined in the system configuration.

		If USBDEV_DMAMEMORY is also defined in the NuttX configuration, then
		the driver implementations of the allocbuffer() and freebuffer()
		methods may use board-specific usbdev_dma_alloc() and usbdev_dma_free().
		If USBDEV_DMA and USBDEV_DMAMEMORY are both defined, then the board-
		specific logic must provide the functions usbdev_dma_alloc() and
		usbdev_dma_free(): usbdev_dma_alloc() will allocate DMA-capable
		memory of the specified size; usbdev_dma_free() is the corresponding
		function that will be called to free the DMA-capable memory.

config ARCH_USBDEV_STALLQUEUE
	bool
	default n
	---help---
		This option is set by the USB device controller driver (DCD)
		selection.  These selection means that the DCD can support
		queuing of stall requests.  By this, it is meant that, (1) the
		stall is not sent until all write requests preceding the stall
		request are sent, (2) the stall is sent, and then after the
		stall is cleared, (3) all write requests queued after the stall
		are sent.

		If the driver does not support this feature, that the class drivers
		will enable some hokey and inefficient delay logic to workaround
		the lack of queuing.

config USBDEV_TRACE
	bool "Enable USB tracing for debug"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables USB tracing for debug

config USBDEV_TRACE_NRECORDS
	int "Number of trace entries to remember"
	default 128
	depends on USBDEV_TRACE
	---help---
		Number of trace entries to remember

config USBDEV_TRACE_STRINGS
bool "Decode device controller events"
	default n
	depends on USBDEV_TRACE || DEBUG_USB
	---help---
		If USBDEV_TRACE_STRINGS is defined, then the USB device controller
		driver must provide arrays of strings to support decoding of device-
		specific trace events.  These arrays of strings (and the type struct
		trace_msg_t) are defined in include/nuttx/usb/usbdev_trace.h:

		#ifdef CONFIG_USBDEV_TRACE_STRINGS
		extern const struct trace_msg_t g_usb_trace_strings_deverror[];
		extern const struct trace_msg_t g_usb_trace_strings_intdecode[];
		#endif

	default n
	---help---
		If one of the members of the composite has multiple interfaces
		(such as CDC/ACM), then an Interface Association Descriptor (IAD)
		will be necessary.  Default:  IAD will be used automatically if
		needed.  It should not be necessary to set this.

	default 96  if !USBDEV_DUALSPEED
	---help---
		Ideally, the BULKOUT request size should *not* be the same size as
		the maxpacket size.  That is because IN transfers of exactly the
		maxpacket size will be followed by a NULL packet.  The BULKOUT,
		on the other hand, request buffer size is always the same as the
		maxpacket size.
