# a new-style toolchain specification, force the selection of a single
# toolchain and allow the selected toolchain to be overridden by a
# command-line selection.

#                   invoking ar and nm.
#  ARCHCPUFLAGS     CPU-specific flags selecting the instruction set
#                   options, etc.
#  MAXOPTIMIZATION  The maximum optimization level that results in
#                   reliable code generation.
