 * Name: up_allocate_heap
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function will be called to dynamically set aside the heap region.
 *
 *   For the kernel build (CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL=y) with both kernel- and
 *   user-space heaps (CONFIG_MM_KERNEL_HEAP=y), this function provides the
 *   size of the unprotected, user-space heap.
 *
 *   If a protected kernel-space heap is provided, the kernel heap must be
 *   allocated (and protected) by an analogous up_allocate_kheap().
