/* A task group must have its L1 table in memory always, and the rest can
 * be dynamically committed to memory (and even swapped).
 *
 * In this implementation every level tables besides the final level N are
 * kept in memory always, while the level N tables are dynamically allocated.
 *
 * The implications ? They depend on the MMU type.
 *
 * For Sv32 this means that:
 * - A task can not have more than 4GB of memory allocated.
 * - The minimum amount of memory needed for page tables per task is 8K,
 *   which gives access to 4MB of memory. This is plenty for many tasks.
 *
 * For Sv39 this means that:
 * - A task can not have more than 1GB of memory allocated. This should be
 *   plenty enough...
 * - The minimum amount of memory needed for page tables per task is 12K,
 *   which gives access to 2MB of memory. This is plenty for many tasks.
