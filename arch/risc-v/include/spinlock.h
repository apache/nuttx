/* Memory barriers for use with NuttX spinlock logic
 *
 * Data Memory Barrier (DMB) acts as a memory barrier. It ensures that all
 * explicit memory accesses that appear in program order before the DMB
 * instruction are observed before any explicit memory accesses that appear
 * in program order after the DMB instruction. It does not affect the
 * ordering of any other instructions executing on the processor
 *
 * Data Synchronization Barrier (DSB) acts as a special kind of memory
 * barrier. No instruction in program order after this instruction executes
 * until this instruction completes. This instruction completes when: (1) All
 * explicit memory accesses before this instruction complete, and (2) all
 * Cache, Branch predictor and TLB maintenance operations before this
 * instruction complete.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: up_testset
 *
 * Description:
 *   Perform an atomic test and set operation on the provided spinlock.
 *
 *   This function must be provided via the architecture-specific logic.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   lock - The address of spinlock object.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   The spinlock is always locked upon return.  The value of previous value
 *   of the spinlock variable is returned, either SP_LOCKED if the spinlock
 *   as previously locked (meaning that the test-and-set operation failed to
 *   obtain the lock) or SP_UNLOCKED if the spinlock was previously unlocked
 *   (meaning that we successfully obtained the lock)
