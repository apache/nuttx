config SIM_M32
	bool "Build 32-bit simulation on 64-bit machine"
	default n
	depends on HOST_X86_64
	---help---
		Simulation context switching is based on logic like setjmp and longjmp.  This
		context switching is only available for 32-bit targets.  On 64-bit machines,
		this context switching will fail.

		The workaround on 64-bit machines for now is to build for a 32-bit target on the
		64-bit machine.  The workaround for this issue has been included in NuttX 6.15 and
		beyond.  For thoses versions, you must add SIM_M32=y to the .config file in
		order to enable building a 32-bit image on a 64-bit platform.

config SIM_WALLTIME
	bool "Execution simulation in near real-time"
	default n
	---help---
		NOTE:  In order to facility fast testing, the sim target's IDLE loop, by default,
		calls the system timer "interrupt handler" as fast as possible.  As a result, there
		really are no noticeable delays when a task sleeps.  However, the task really does
		sleep -- but the time scale is wrong.  If you want behavior that is closer to
		normal timing, then you can define SIM_WALLTIME=y in your configuration
		file.  This configuration setting will cause the sim target's IDLE loop to delay
		on each call so that the system "timer interrupt" is called at a rate approximately
		correct for the system timer tick rate.  With this definition in the configuration,
		sleep() behavior is more or less normal.

	default 8
	---help---
		Pixel depth in bits.  Valid choices are 4, 8, 16, 24, or 32.
		If you use the X11 display emulation, the selected BPP must match the BPP
		of your graphics hardware (probably 32 bits).  Default: 8

config SIM_SPIFLASH_MEMORY_TYPE

config SIM_SPIFLASH_SECTORSIZE
	int "FLASH Sector Erase Size"
	default 65536
	depends on SIM_SPIFLASH
	---help---
		Sets the large sector erase size that the part simulates.
		This driver simulates SPI devices that have both a large
		sector erase as well as a "sub-sector" (per the datasheet)
		erase size (typically 4K bytes).

config SIM_SPIFLASH_SUBSECTORSIZE
	int "FLASH Sub-Sector Erase Size"
	default 4096
	depends on SIM_SPIFLASH
	---help---
		Sets the smaller sub-sector erase size supported by the
		FLASH emulation

config SIM_SPIFLASH_PAGESIZE
	int "FLASH Write / Program Page Size"
	default 256
	depends on SIM_SPIFLASH
	---help---
		Sets the size of a page program operation.  The page size
		represents the maximum number of bytes that can be sent
		for a program operation.  If more bytes than this are
		sent on a single Page Program, then the address will
		"wrap" causing the initial data sent to be overwritten.
		This is consistent with standard SPI FLASH operation.
