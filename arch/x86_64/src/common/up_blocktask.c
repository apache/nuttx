 * Name: up_block_task
 *
 * Description:
 *   The currently executing task at the head of the ready to run list must
 *   be stopped.  Save its context and move it to the inactive list
 *   specified by task_state.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   tcb: Refers to a task in the ready-to-run list (normally the task at
 *     the head of the list).  It must be stopped, its context saved and
 *     moved into one of the waiting task lists.  If it was the task at the
 *     head of the ready-to-run list, then a context switch to the new
 *     ready to run task must be performed.
 *   task_state: Specifies which waiting task list should hold the blocked
 *     task TCB.
 *
