 * Name: up_create_stack
 *
 * Description:
 *   Allocate a stack for a new thread and setup up stack-related information
 *   in the TCB.
 *
 *   The following TCB fields must be initialized by this function:
 *
 *   - adj_stack_size: Stack size after adjustment for hardware, processor,
 *     etc.  This value is retained only for debug purposes.
 *   - stack_alloc_ptr: Pointer to allocated stack
 *   - adj_stack_ptr: Adjusted stack_alloc_ptr for HW.  The initial value of
 *     the stack pointer.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   - tcb: The TCB of new task
 *   - stack_size:  The requested stack size.  At least this much
 *     must be allocated.
 *   - ttype:  The thread type.  This may be one of following (defined in
 *     include/nuttx/sched.h):
 *
 *       TCB_FLAG_TTYPE_TASK     Normal user task
 *       TCB_FLAG_TTYPE_PTHREAD  User pthread
 *       TCB_FLAG_TTYPE_KERNEL   Kernel thread
 *
 *     This thread type is normally available in the flags field of the TCB,
 *     however, there are certain contexts where the TCB may not be fully
 *     initialized when up_create_stack is called.
