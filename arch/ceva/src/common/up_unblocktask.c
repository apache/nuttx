 * Name: up_unblock_task
 *
 * Description:
 *   A task is currently in the ready-to-run list but has been prepped
 *   to execute. Restore its context, and start execution.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   tcb: Refers to the head task of the ready-to-run list
 *     which will be executed.
 *   rtcb: Refers to the running task which will be blocked.
 *
