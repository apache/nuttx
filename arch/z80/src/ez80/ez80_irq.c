/****************************************************************************
 * Name: up_disable_irq
 *
 * Description:
 *   On many architectures, there are three levels of interrupt enabling: (1)
 *   at the global level, (2) at the level of the interrupt controller,
 *   and (3) at the device level.  In order to receive interrupts, they
 *   must be enabled at all three levels.
 *
 *   This function implements disabling of the device specified by 'irq'
 *   at the interrupt controller level if supported by the architecture
 *   (up_irq_save() supports the global level, the device level is hardware
 *   specific).
