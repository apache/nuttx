/************************************************************************************
 * Name: ez80_i2cbus_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   Initialize the selected I2C port. And return a unique instance of struct
 *   struct i2c_master_s.  This function may be called to obtain multiple
 *   instances of the interface, each of which may be set up with a
 *   different frequency and slave address.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   Port number (for hardware that has multiple I2C interfaces)
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Valid I2C device structure reference on success; a NULL on failure
 *

 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK on success, ERROR when internal reference count mismatch or dev
 *   points to invalid hardware device.
