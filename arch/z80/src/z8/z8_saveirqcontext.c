 * Name: z8_saveirqcontext
 *
 * Description:
 *   In order to provide faster interrupt handling, the interrupt logic does
 *   "lazy" context saving as described below:
 *
 *   (1) At the time of the interrupt, minimum information is saved and the
 *       register pointer is changed so that the interrupt logic does not
 *       alter the state of the interrupted task's registers.
 *   (2) If no context switch occurs during the interrupt processing, then
 *       the return from interrupt is also simple.
 *   (3) If a context switch occurs during interrupt processing, then
 *       (a) The full context of the interrupt task is saved, and
 *       (b) A full context switch is performed when the interrupt exits
 *           (see z8_vector.S).
 *
 * This function implements the full-context switch of bullet 3a.
 *
