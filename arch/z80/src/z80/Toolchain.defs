# Setup for the selected toolchain

#
# SDCC is currently the only z80 toolchain supported.  See
# http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/.  Source and pre-built SDCC binaries can be
# downloaded from the SDCC SourceForge site:
# http://sourceforge.net/projects/sdcc/files/.  Pre-built binaries are
# available for Linux, macOS, and for Win32.  In addition, SDCC can be
# built to run on Windows as a POSIX toolchain.  The various SDCC options are
# selected in the NuttX configuration with:
#
#  CONFIG_Z80_TOOLCHAIN_SDCCL=y : SDCC for Linux, macOS or Cygwin
#  CONFIG_Z80_TOOLCHAIN_SDCCW=y : SDCC for Win32
#

ifeq ($(filter y, \
      $(CONFIG_Z80_TOOLCHAIN_SDCCL) \
    ),y)
  CONFIG_Z80_TOOLCHAIN ?= SDCCPOSIX
endif
ifeq ($(filter y, \
      $(CONFIG_Z80_TOOLCHAIN_SDCCW) \
    ),y)
  CONFIG_Z80_TOOLCHAIN ?= SDCCWIN32
endif

# SDCC toolchain under Linux, macOS or Cygwin

ifeq ($(CONFIG_Z80_TOOLCHAIN),POSIX)
endif

# SDCC  toolchain under Windows/Cygwin

ifeq ($(CONFIG_AVR_TOOLCHAIN),SDCCWIN32)
  ifeq ($(CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN),y)
    WINTOOL = y
  endif
