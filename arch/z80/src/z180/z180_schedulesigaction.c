 * Name: up_schedule_sigaction
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is called by the OS when one or more
 *   signal handling actions have been queued for execution.
 *   The architecture specific code must configure things so
 *   that the 'sigdeliver' callback is executed on the thread
 *   specified by 'tcb' as soon as possible.
 *
 *   This function may be called from interrupt handling logic.
 *
 *   This operation should not cause the task to be unblocked
 *   nor should it cause any immediate execution of sigdeliver.
 *   Typically, a few cases need to be considered:
 *
 *   (1) This function may be called from an interrupt handler
 *       During interrupt processing, all xcptcontext structures
 *       should be valid for all tasks.  That structure should
 *       be modified to invoke sigdeliver() either on return
 *       from (this) interrupt or on some subsequent context
 *       switch to the recipient task.
 *   (2) If not in an interrupt handler and the tcb is NOT
 *       the currently executing task, then again just modify
 *       the saved xcptcontext structure for the recipient
 *       task so it will invoke sigdeliver when that task is
 *       later resumed.
 *   (3) If not in an interrupt handler and the tcb IS the
 *       currently executing task -- just call the signal
 *       handler now.
 *
