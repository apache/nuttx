/* TRAP Interrupt
 *
 * The Z8X180 generates a non-maskable TRAP interrupt when an undefined Op
 * Code fetch occurs. When a TRAP interrupt occurs the Z8X180 operates as
 * follows:
 *
 * 1. The TRAP bit in the Interrupt TRAP/Control (ITC) register is set to 1.
 * 2. The current PC (Program Counter) is saved on the stack.
 * 3. The Z8X180 vectors to logical address 0 (which may or may not be the
 *    same as reset which vectors to physical address 0x00000).
 *
 * The state of the UFO (Undefined Fetch Object) bit in ITC allows TRAP
 * manipulation software to correctly adjust the stacked PC, depending on
 * whether the second or third byte of the Op Code generated the TRAP. If
 * UFO is 0, the starting address of the invalid instruction is equal to
 * the stacked PC-1. If UFO is 1, the starting address of the invalid
 * instruction is equal to the stacked PC-2.
 */

#define Z180_TRAP          (7)

/* INT0
 *
 * INT0 (only) has 3 different software programmable interrupt response
 * modes—Mode 0, Mode 1 and Mode 2.
 *
 * - INT0 Mode 0. During the interrupt acknowledge cycle, an instruction
 *   is fetched from the data bus (DO–D7) at the rising edge of T3.
 *
 * - INT0 Mode 1. The PC is stacked and instruction execution restarts at
 *   logical address 0x0038.
 *
 * - INT0 Mode 2. The restart address is obtained by reading the contents
 *   of a table residing in memory. The vector table consists of up to
 *   128 two-byte restart addresses stored in low byte, high byte order.
 *
 *   This is similar to normal vector mode interrupts (like INT1 and 2):
 *   The 256-bit table address comes from I, however the lower-order 8
 *   bits of the vector is fetched from the data bus.
 */

#define Z180_INT0          (8)

/* Vector Interrupts
 *
 * Normal vector interrupts use a vector table with 16 entries (2 bytes
 * per entry).  Each entry holds the address of the interrupt handler.
 * The vector table address is determined by 11-bits from the I and IL
 * registers.  The vector table must be aligned on 32-byte address
 * boundaries.
