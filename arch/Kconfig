		NOTE: The use of interrupt priorities implies that you also have

config ARCH_IDLE_CUSTOM
	bool "Custom IDLE loop"
	default n
	---help---
		Each architecture provides a "default" IDLE loop that exits when the
		MCU has nothing else to do.  This default IDLE loop can be replaced
		by a custom, board-specific IDLE loop by setting this option.  Such
		a custom IDLE loop may do things like a continuous built-in test or
		perhaps or IDLE low power operations.

		NOTE: As of this writing, this capability is only supported by the

		Make.defs file.

config ARCH_CUSTOM_PMINIT
	bool "Custom PM initialization"
	default n
	depends on PM
	---help---
		Each architecture provides default power management (PM)
		initialization that is called automatically when the system is
		started. This default PM initialization can be replaced by custom,
		board-specific PM initialization by setting this option.  Such a
		custom initialization may do additional PM-related initialization
		that is unique to the board power management requirements.

		NOTE: As of this writing, this capability is only supported by the
		STM32.  However, the implementation is trivial:  If CONFIG_ARCH_CUSTOM_PMINIT,
		then the default PM initialization is not included in the MCU-specific
		Make.defs file.

		Copy some functions to RAM at boot time.  This is done in some

	int "Delay loops per millisecond"
	default 5000
	---help---
		Simple delay loops are used by some logic, especially during boot-up,

		board in order to assure accurate timing by the delay loops.

config ARCH_CALIBRATION
	bool "Calibrate delay loop"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables some built in instrumentation that causes a 100 second delay
		during boot-up.  This 100 second delay serves no purpose other than it
		allows you to calibrate BOARD_LOOPSPERMSEC.  You simply use a stop
		watch to measure the actual delay then adjust BOARD_LOOPSPERMSEC until

	bool
	default n

config ARCH_HIPRI_INTERRUPT
	bool "High priority interrupts"
	default n
	depends on ARCH_HAVE_HIPRI_INTERRUPT && ARCH_HAVE_IRQPRIO
	select ARMV7M_USEBASEPRI
	select ARCH_IRQPRIO
	---help---
		NOTE: This description is currently unique to the Cortex-M family
		which is the only family that currently supports this feature.  The
		general feature is not conceptually unique to the Cortex-M but it
		is extended to any other family, then this discussion will have to
		be generalized.

		If ARMV7M_USEBASEPRI is selected, then interrupts will be disabled
		by setting the BASEPRI register to NVIC_SYSH_DISABLE_PRIORITY so
		that most interrupts will not have execution priority.  SVCall must
		have execution priority in all cases.

		In the normal cases, interrupts are not nest-able and all interrupts
		run at an execution priority between NVIC_SYSH_PRIORITY_MIN and
		NVIC_SYSH_PRIORITY_MAX (with NVIC_SYSH_PRIORITY_MAX reserved for
		SVCall).

		If, in addition, ARCH_HIPRI_INTERRUPT is defined, then special high
		priority interrupts are supported.  These are not "nested" in the
		normal sense of the word.  These high priority interrupts can
		interrupt normal processing but execute outside of OS (although they
		can "get back into the game" via a PendSV interrupt).

		How do you specify a high priority interrupt?  You need to do two
		things:

			1) You need to change the address in the vector table so that
			   the high priority interrupt vectors to your special C
			   interrupt handler.  There are two ways to do this:

			   a) If you select CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS, then vectors will
			      be kept in RAM and the system will support the interface:

			      int up_ramvec_attach(int irq, up_vector_t vector)

			      that can be used to attach your C interrupt handler to the
			      vector at run time.

			   b) Alternatively, you could keep your vectors in FLASH but in
			      order to this, you would have to develop your own custom
			      vector table.

			2) Then set the priority of your interrupt to NVIC to
			   NVIC_SYSH_HIGH_PRIORITY using the standard interface:

			   int up_prioritize_irq(int irq, int priority)

		NOTE: ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK must be set in kernel mode (BUILD_KERNEL).
		In kernel mode without an interrupt stack, the interrupt handler
		will set the MSP to the stack pointer of the interrupted thread.  If
		the interrupted thread was a privileged thread, that will be the MSP
		otherwise it will be the PSP.  If the PSP is used, then the value of
		the MSP will be invalid when the interrupt handler returns because
		it will be a pointer to an old position in the unprivileged stack.
		Then when the high priority interrupt occurs and uses this stale MSP,
		there will most likely be a system failure.

		If the interrupt stack is selected, on the other hand, then the
		interrupt handler will always set the the MSP to the interrupt
		stack.  So when the high priority interrupt occurs, it will either
		use the MSP of the last privileged thread to run or, in the case of
		the nested interrupt, the interrupt stack if no privileged task has
		run

config ARCH_INT_DISABLEALL
	bool "Disable high priority interrupts"
	default y
	depends on ARCH_HIPRI_INTERRUPT && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
		If ARCH_HIPRI_INTERRUPT is defined, then special high priority
		interrupts are supported.  These are not "nested" in the normal
		sense of the word.  These high priority interrupts can interrupt
		normal processing but execute outside of OS (although they can "get
		back into the game" via a PendSV interrupt).

		In the normal course of things, interrupts must occasionally be
		disabled using the irqsave() inline function to prevent contention
		in use of resources that may be shared between interrupt level and
		non-interrupt level logic.  Now the question arises, if
		ARCH_HIPRI_INTERRUPT, do we disable all interrupts (except SVCall),
		or do we only disable the "normal" interrupts.  Since the high
		priority interrupts cannot interact with the OS, you may want to
		permit the high priority interrupts even if interrupts are
		disabled.  The setting ARCH_INT_DISABLEALL can be used to select
		either behavior:

		----------------------------+--------------+----------------------------
		CONFIG_ARCH_HIPRI_INTERRUPT |      NO      |             YES
		----------------------------+--------------+--------------+-------------
		CONFIG_ARCH_INT_DISABLEALL  |     N/A      |     YES      |      NO
		----------------------------+--------------+--------------+-------------
		                            |              |              |    SVCall
		                            |    SVCall    |    SVCall    |    HIGH
		Disable here and below --------> MAXNORMAL ---> HIGH --------> MAXNORMAL
		                            |              |    MAXNORMAL |
		----------------------------+--------------+--------------+-------------

		NOTE: This does not work now because interrupts get disabled in the
		standard interrupt handling, prohibiting nesting.  Fix is simple:  Need
		to used more priority levels so that we can make a cleaner distinction
		with the standard interrupt handler.
