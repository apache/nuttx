# Supported toolchains
#
# Each toolchain definition should set:
#
#  CROSSDEV         The GNU toolchain triple (command prefix)
#  ARCROSSDEV       If required, an alternative prefix used when
#                   invoking ar and nm.
#  ARCHCPUFLAGS     CPU-specific flags selecting the instruction set
#                   FPU options, etc.
#  MAXOPTIMIZATION  The maximum optimization level that results in
#                   reliable code generation.
#

CROSSDEV = xtensa-esp32-elf-
ARCROSSDEV = xtensa-esp32-elf-
