 * Name: xtensa_compareset
 *
 * Description:
 *   Wrapper for the Xtensa compare-and-set instruction. This function will
 *   atomically compare *addr to compare, and if it's the same, will set
 *   *addr to set. It will return the old value of *addr.
 *
 *   Warning: From the ISA docs: in some (unspecified) cases, the s32c1i
 *   instruction may return the *bitwise inverse* of the old mem if the
 *   mem wasn't written. This doesn't seem to happen on the ESP32, though.
 *   (Would show up directly if it did because the magic wouldn't match.)

 * Name: up_testset
 *
 * Description:
 *   Perform an atomic test and set operation on the provided spinlock.
 *
 *   This function must be provided via the architecture-specific logic.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   lock - The address of spinlock object.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   The spinlock is always locked upon return.  The value of previous value
 *   of the spinlock variable is returned, either SP_LOCKED if the spinlock
 *   was previously locked (meaning that the test-and-set operation failed to
 *   obtain the lock) or SP_UNLOCKED if the spinlock was previously unlocked
 *   (meaning that we successfully obtained the lock)

   *  operation on memory.  In rare cases the resulting value in register
   *  at can be different in this and later releases. The rule still holds
   *  that memory has been written if and only if the register result
   *  equals SCOMPARE1.
   *
   * "The difference is that in some cases where memory has not been
   *  written, the instruction returns ~SCOMPARE1 instead of the current
   *  value of memory.  Although this change can, in principle, affect
   *  the operation of code, scanning all internal Cadence code produced
   *  no examples where this change would change the operation of the
