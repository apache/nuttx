/* XTENSA CONTEXT SAVE AND RESTORE ROUTINES
 *
 * Low-level Call0 functions for handling generic context save and restore
 * of registers not specifically addressed by the interrupt vectors and
 * handlers.  Those registers (not handled by these functions) are PC, PS,
 * A0, A1 (SP).
 *
 * Note that in Call0 ABI, interrupt handlers are expected to preserve the callee-
 * save regs (A12-A15), which is always the case if the handlers are coded in C.
 * However A12, A13 are made available as scratch registers for interrupt dispatch
 * code, so are presumed saved anyway, and are always restored even in Call0 ABI.
 * Only A14, A15 are truly handled as callee-save regs.
 *
 * Because Xtensa is a configurable architecture, this port supports all user
 * generated configurations (except restrictions stated in the release notes).
 * This is accomplished by conditional compilation using macros and functions
 * defined in the Xtensa HAL (hardware adaptation layer) for your configuration.
 * Only the processor state included in your configuration is saved and restored,
 * including any processor state added by user configuration options or TIE.

 * Name: _xtensa_context_save

 * Description:
 *
 *   NOTE: MUST BE CALLED ONLY BY 'CALL0' INSTRUCTION!
 *
 *   This function saves Xtensa processor state.
 *   It is called directly by interrupt handling logic with interrupts
 *   disabled.  Registers PC, PS, A0, A1 (SP), A2 and A3 are saved before
 *   calling this function. 
 *
 *   The counterpart to this function is _xtensa_context_restore().
 *
 * Entry Conditions:
 *   - A0  = Return address to caller.
 *   - A2  = Pointer to the processor state save area
 *   - Other processor state except PC, PS, A0, A1 (SP), A2 and A3 are as at
 *     the point of interruption.
 *
 * Exit conditions:
 *   - A0  = Return address in caller.
 *   - A2, A12-A15 as at entry (preserved).
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   - Caller is expected to have saved PC, PS, A0, A1 (SP), and A2.
 *   - If windowed ABI, PS.EXCM = 1 (exceptions disabled).
