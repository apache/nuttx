/* The Type of a spinlock.

 * This must be a uint32_ because it will be set using S32C1I instruction.
 * That instruction atomically stores to a memory location only if its
 * current value is the expected one.  The state register (SCOMPARE1) is
 * used to provide the additional comparison operand. Some implementations
 * also have a state register (ATOMCTL) for further control of the atomic
 * operation in cache and on the PIF bus.

 * Name: up_testset
 *
 * Description:
 *   Perform an atomic test and set operation on the provided spinlock.
 *
 *   This function must be provided via the architecture-specific logic.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   lock - The address of spinlock object.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   The spinlock is always locked upon return.  The value of previous value
 *   of the spinlock variable is returned, either SP_LOCKED if the spinlock
 *   as previously locked (meaning that the test-and-set operation failed to
 *   obtain the lock) or SP_UNLOCKED if the spinlock was previously unlocked
 *   (meaning that we successfully obtained the lock)
