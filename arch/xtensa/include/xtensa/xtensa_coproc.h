/* CO-PROCESSOR STATE SAVE AREA FOR A THREAD
 *
 * NuttX provides an area per thread to save the state of co-processors when
 * that thread does not have control.  Co-processors are context-switched
 * lazily (on demand) only when a new thread uses a co-processor instruction,
 * otherwise a thread retains ownership of the co-processor even when it
 * loses control of the processor. An Xtensa co-processor exception is
 * triggered when any co-processor instruction is executed by a thread that
 * is not the owner, and the context switch of that co-processor is then
 * performed by the handler. Ownership represents which thread's state is
 * currently in the co-processor.
 *
 * Co-processors may not be used by interrupt or exception handlers. If an
 * co-processor instruction is executed by an interrupt or exception handler,
 * the co-processor exception handler will trigger a kernel panic and freeze.
 * This restriction is introduced to reduce the overhead of saving and
 * restoring co-processor state (which can be quite large) and in particular
 * remove that overhead from interrupt handlers.
 *
 * The co-processor state save area may be in any convenient per-thread
 * location such as in the thread control block or above the thread stack
 * area. It need not be in the interrupt stack frame since interrupts don't
 * use co-processors.
 *
 * Along with the save area for each co-processor, two bitmasks with flags
 * per co-processor (laid out as in the CPENABLE reg) help manage context-
 * switching co-processors as efficiently as possible:
 *
 * XTENSA_CPENABLE
 *   The contents of a non-running thread's CPENABLE register.
 *   It represents the co-processors owned (and whose state is still needed)
 *   by the thread. When a thread is preempted, its CPENABLE is saved here.
 *   When a thread solicits a context-swtich, its CPENABLE is cleared - the
 *   compiler has saved the (caller-saved) co-proc state if it needs to.
 *   When a non-running thread loses ownership of a CP, its bit is cleared.
 *   When a thread runs, it's XTENSA_CPENABLE is loaded into the CPENABLE
 *   reg. Avoids co-processor exceptions when no change of ownership is
 *   needed.
 *
 * XTENSA_CPSTORED
 *   A bitmask with the same layout as CPENABLE, a bit per co-processor.
 *   Indicates whether the state of each co-processor is saved in the state
 *   save area. When the state of a thread is saved, only the state of
 *   co-procs still enabled in CPENABLE is saved. When the co-processor
 *   state is restored, the state is only resotred for a co-processor if
 *   this bit is set.  This bist set is cleared after after co-processor
 *   state has been restored.
 *
 * XTENSA_CPASA
 *   Pointer to the aligned save area.  Allows it to be aligned more than
 *   the overall save area (which might only be stack-aligned or
 *   TCB-aligned).
 *   Especially relevant for Xtensa cores configured with a very large data
 *   path that requires alignment greater than 16 bytes (ABI stack
 *   alignment).
