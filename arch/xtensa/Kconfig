	---help---
		The ESP32 is a dual-core system from Espressif with two Harvard
		architecture Xtensa LX6 CPUs. All embedded memory, external memory
		and peripherals are located on the data bus and/or the instruction
		bus of these CPUs. With some minor exceptions, the address mapping
		of two CPUs is symmetric, meaning they use the same addresses to
		access the same memory.

		The two CPUs are named "PRO_CPU" and "APP_CPU" (for "protocol" and
		"application"), however for most purposes the two CPUs are
		interchangeable.

config ARCH_CHIP_XTENSA_CUSTOM
	bool "Custom XTENSA chip"
	select ARCH_CHIP_CUSTOM
	---help---
		Select this option if there is no directory for the chip under arch/xtensa/src/.

config ARCH_FAMILY_LX6
	bool
	default n
	---help---
		Cadence® Tensilica® Xtensa® LX6 data plane processing unit (DPU).
		The LX6 is a configurable and extensible processor core.

	string
	default "esp32"		if ARCH_CHIP_ESP32

config XTENSA_CP_LAZY
	bool "Lazy co-processor state restoration"
	default n
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
		NuttX logic saves and restores the co-processor enabled (CPENABLE)
		register on each context switch.  This has disadvantages in that (1)
		co-processor context will be saved and restored even if the co-
		processor was never used, and (2) tasks must explicitly enable and
		disable co-processors.

		An alternative, "lazy" co-processor state restore is enabled with
		this option.  That logic works like as follows:

		a. CPENABLE is set to zero on each context switch, disabling all co-
		   processors.
		b. If/when the task attempts to use the disabled co-processor, an
		   exception occurs
		c. The co-processor exception handler re-enables the co-processor.

config XTENSA_USE_OVLY
	bool
	default n
	---help---
		Enable code overlay support. This option is currently unsupported.

config XTENSA_CP_INITSET
	hex "Default co-processor enables"
	default 0x0001
	range 0 0xffff
	depends on !XTENSA_CP_LAZY
	---help---
		Co-processors may be enabled on a thread by calling xtensa_coproc_enable()
		and disabled by calling xtensa_coproc_disable().  Some co-processors
		should be enabled on all threads by default.  That set of co-processors
		is provided by CONFIG_XTENSA_CP_INITSET.  Each bit corresponds to one
		coprocessor with the same bit layout as for the CPENABLE register.

config XTENSA_USE_SEPARATE_IMEM
	bool "Use a separate heap for internal memory"
	default n
	help
		This is a separate internal heap that's used by drivers when certain operations
		are not possible with the provided buffer(s).
		Mainly, when the provided buffer comes from external RAM and a DMA or flash 
		operation is going to be performed.

		This separate heap will be part of the internal DRAM.  It starts right after .data
		and ends at the configurable size given by the OPTION XTENSA_IMEM_REGION_SIZE.

	hex "DRAM region size for internal use"
	depends on XTENSA_USE_SEPARATE_IMEM
