	default n

config ARMV8M_HAVE_DCACHE

	default n

config ARMV8M_USEBASEPRI
	bool "Use BASEPRI Register"
	default y if ARCH_HIPRI_INTERRUPT
	---help---
		Use the BASEPRI register to enable and disable interrupts. By
		default, the PRIMASK register is used for this purpose. This
		usually results in hardfaults when supervisor calls are made.
		Though, these hardfaults are properly handled by the RTOS, the
		hardfaults can confuse some debuggers. With the BASEPRI
		register, these hardfaults, will be avoided. For more details see
		https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NUTTX/ARMv7-M+Hardfaults%2C+SVCALL%2C+and+Debuggers

		WARNING:  If CONFIG_ARCH_HIPRI_INTERRUPT is selected, then you
		MUST select CONFIG_ARMV8M_USEBASEPRI.  The Kconfig dependencies
		here will permit to select an invalid configuration because it
		cannot enforce that requirement.  If you create this invalid
		configuration, you will encounter some problems that may be
		very difficult to debug.

config ARMV8M_STACKCHECK_NONE
	bool "Do not check for stack overflow"

config ARMV8M_STACKCHECK
	bool "Check for stack overflow on each function call"
	---help---
		This check uses R10 to check for a stack overflow within each
		function call. This has performances and code size impacts, but it
		will be able to catch hard to find stack overflows.

		Currently only available only for the STM32, SAM3/4 and SAMA5D
		architectures.  The changes are not complex and patches for
		other architectures will be accepted.

		This option requires that you are using a GCC toolchain and that
		you also include -finstrument-functions in your CFLAGS when you
		compile.  This addition to your CFLAGS should probably be added
		to the definition of the CFFLAGS in your board Make.defs file.

config ARMV8M_STACKCHECK_HARDWARE
	bool "Check for stack overflow by stack pointer limit register"
	---help---
		This option signifies the CPU has the MSPLIM, PSPLIM registers.

		The stack pointer limit registers, MSPLIM, PSPLIM, limit the
		extend to which the Main and Process Stack Pointers, respectively,
		can descend. MSPLIM, PSPLIM are always present in ARMv8-M
		MCUs that implement the ARMv8-M Main Extension (Mainline).

		In an ARMv8-M Mainline implementation with the Security Extension
		the MSPLIM, PSPLIM registers have additional Secure instances.
		In an ARMv8-M Baseline implementation with the Security Extension
		the MSPLIM, PSPLIM registers have only Secure instances.
