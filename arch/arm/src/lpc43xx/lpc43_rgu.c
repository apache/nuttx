 * Name: lpc43_softreset
 *
 * Description:
 *   Reset as many of the LPC43 peripherals as possible. This is necessary
 *   because the LPC43 does not provide any way of performing a full system
 *   reset under debugger control.  So, if CONFIG_DEBUG_FEATURES is set (indicating
 *   that a debugger is being used?), the boot logic will call this
 *   function on all restarts.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   Since this function is called early in the boot sequence, it cannot
 *   depend on anything such as initialization of .bss or .data.  It can
 *   only assume that it has a stack.
 *
