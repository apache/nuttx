 * Function: arm_netinitialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   This is the "standard" network initialization logic called from the
 *   low-level initialization logic in arm_initialize.c.  This is just
 *   a shim to support the slightly different prototype of
 *   sam_emac_intiialize() and to provide support for future chips that
 *   may have multiple EMAC peripherals.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *
