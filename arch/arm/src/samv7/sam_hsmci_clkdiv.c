 * Name: sam_hsmci_clkdiv
 *
 * Description:
 *   Multimedia Card Interface clock (MCCK or MCI_CK) is Master Clock (MCK)
 *   divided by (2*(CLKDIV) + CLOCKODD + 2).
 *
 *     CLKFULLDIV = 2*CLKDIV + CLOCKODD;
 *     MCI_SPEED  = MCK / (CLKFULLDIV + 2)
 *     CLKFULLDIV = MCK / MCI_SPEED - 2
 *
 *     CLKDIV     = CLKFULLDIV >> 1
 *     CLOCKODD   = CLKFULLDIV & 1
 *
 *   Where CLKDIV has a range of 0-255.
 *
 *   NOTE: The primary use of this function is for cases where the clock
 *   frequencies are not known a priori and so HSMCI clock dividers must
 *   be determined dynamically.  This is the case, for example, when we
 *   execute out of SDRAM.  In that case, the clocking was set up by the
 *   bootloader that brought us into SDRAM and it is that bootloader that
 *   has configured the clocking.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   target - The target SD frequency
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   A bitset containing the CLKDIV and CLKODD bits as needed to configure
 *   the HSMCI clock output.
