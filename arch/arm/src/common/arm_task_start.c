/****************************************************************************
 * Name: up_task_start
 *
 * Description:
 *   In this kernel mode build, this function will be called to execute a
 *   task in user-space.  When the task is first started, a kernel-mode
 *   stub will first run to perform some housekeeping functions.  This
 *   kernel-mode stub will then be called transfer control to the user-mode
 *   task.
 *
 *   Normally the a user-mode start-up stub will also execute before the
 *   task actually starts.  See libc/sched/task_startup.c
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   taskentry - The user-space entry point of the task.
 *   argc - The number of parameters being passed.
 *   argv - The parameters being passed. These lie in kernel-space memory
 *     and will have to be reallocated  in user-space memory.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This function should not return.  It should call the user-mode start-up
 *   stub and that stub should call exit if/when the user task terminates.
 *
