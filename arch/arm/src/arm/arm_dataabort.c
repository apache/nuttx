 * Name: arm_dataabort
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   regs - The standard, ARM register save array.
 *
 * If CONFIG_PAGING is selected in the NuttX configuration file, then these
 * additional input values are expected:
 *
 *   far - Fault address register.  On a data abort, the ARM MMU places the
 *     miss virtual address (MVA) into the FAR register.  This is the address
 *     of the data which, when accessed, caused the fault.
 *   fsr - Fault status register.  On a data a abort, the ARM MMU places an
 *     encoded four-bit value, the fault status, along with the four-bit
 *     encoded domain number, in the data FSR
 *
 * Description:
 *   This is the data abort exception handler. The ARM data abort exception
 *   occurs when a memory fault is detected during a data transfer.
 *
