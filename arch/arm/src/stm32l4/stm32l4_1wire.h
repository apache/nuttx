 * Name: stm32l4_1wireinitialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   Initialize the selected 1-Wire port. And return a unique instance of
 *   struct struct onewire_dev_s.  This function may be called to obtain
 *   multiple instances of the interface, each of which may be set up with a
 *   different frequency and slave address.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   Port number (for hardware that has multiple 1-Wire interfaces)
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Valid 1-Wire device structure reference on success; a NULL on failure
 *

 * Name: stm32l4_1wireuninitialize

 * Description:
 *   De-initialize the selected 1-Wire port, and power down the device.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   Device structure as returned by the stm32l4_1wireinitialize()
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK on success, ERROR when internal reference count mismatch or dev
 *   points to invalid hardware device.
