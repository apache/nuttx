/* Waste CPU Time
 *
 *   stm32l4_waste() is the logic that will be executed when portions of
 *   kernel or user-app is polling some register or similar, waiting for
 *   desired status. This time is wasted away. This function offers a
 *   measure of badly written piece of software or some undesired behavior.
 *
 *   At the same time this function adds to some IDLE time which portion
 *   cannot be used for other purposes (yet).
