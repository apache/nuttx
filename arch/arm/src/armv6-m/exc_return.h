/* The processor saves an EXC_RETURN value to the LR on exception entry. The
 * exception mechanism relies on this value to detect when the processor has
 * completed an exception handler.
 *
 * Bits [31:4] of an EXC_RETURN value are always 1.  When the processor loads a
 * value matching this pattern to the PC it detects that the operation is a not
 * a normal branch operation and instead, that the exception is complete.
 * Therefore, it starts the exception return sequence.
 *
 * Bits[3:0] of the EXC_RETURN value indicate the required return stack and eventual
 * processor mode.  The remaining bits of the EXC_RETURN value should be set to 1.
