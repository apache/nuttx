 * Name: up_initial_state
 *
 * Description:
 *   A new thread is being started and a new TCB
 *   has been created. This function is called to initialize
 *   the processor specific portions of the new TCB.
 *
 *   This function must setup the initial architecture registers
 *   and/or  stack so that execution will begin at tcb->start
 *   on the next context switch.
