/****************************************************************************
 * Name: stm32_otgfshost_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   Initialize USB host device controller hardware.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   controller -- If the device supports more than USB host controller, then
 *     this identifies which controller is being initializeed.  Normally, this
 *     is just zero.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   And instance of the USB host interface.  The controlling task should
 *   use this interface to (1) call the wait() method to wait for a device
 *   to be connected, and (2) call the enumerate() method to bind the device
 *   to a class driver.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - This function should called in the initialization sequence in order
 *   to initialize the USB device functionality.
 * - Class drivers should be initialized prior to calling this function.
 *   Otherwise, there is a race condition if the device is already connected.

 *   mode. This is an opportunity for the board logic to shutdown clocks, power,
 *   etc. while the USB is suspended.
