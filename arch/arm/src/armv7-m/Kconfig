config ARMV7M_HAVE_ICACHE
	bool
	default n

config ARMV7M_HAVE_DCACHE

	default n

config ARMV7M_LAZYFPU
	bool "Lazy FPU storage"
	default n
	depends on ARCH_HAVE_LAZYFPU
	---help---
		There are two forms of the common vector logic.  There are pros and
		cons to each option:

		1) The standard common vector logic exploits features of the ARMv7-M
		   architecture to save the all of floating registers on entry into
		   each interrupt and then to restore the floating registers when
		   the interrupt returns.  The primary advantage to this approach is
		   that floating point operations are available in interrupt
		   handling logic.  Since the volatile registers are preserved,
		   operations on the floating point registers by interrupt handling
		   logic has no ill effect.  The downside is, of course, that more
		   stack operations are required on each interrupt to save and store
		   the floating point registers.  Because of the some special
		   features of the ARMv-M, this is not as much overhead as you might
		   expect, but overhead nonetheless.

		2) The lazy FPU common vector logic does not save or restore
		   floating point registers on entry and exit from the interrupt
		   handler. Rather, the floating point registers are not restored
		   until it is absolutely necessary to do so when a context switch
		   occurs and the interrupt handler will be returning to a different
		   floating point context.  Since floating point registers are not
		   protected, floating point operations must not be performed in
		   interrupt handling logic.  Better interrupt performance is be
		   expected, however.

		By default, the "standard" common vector logic is build.  This
		option selects the alternate lazy FPU common vector logic.

config ARMV7M_USEBASEPRI
	bool "Use BASEPRI Register"
	default y if ARCH_HIPRI_INTERRUPT
	depends on ARCH_CORTEXM3 || ARCH_CORTEXM4 || ARCH_CORTEXM7
	---help---
		Use the BASEPRI register to enable and disable interrupts. By
		default, the PRIMASK register is used for this purpose. This
		usually results in hardfaults when supervisor calls are made.
		Though, these hardfaults are properly handled by the RTOS, the
		hardfaults can confuse some debuggers. With the BASEPRI
		register, these hardfaults, will be avoided. For more details see
		https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NUTTX/ARMv7-M+Hardfaults%2C+SVCALL%2C+and+Debuggers

		WARNING:  If CONFIG_ARCH_HIPRI_INTERRUPT is selected, then you
		MUST select CONFIG_ARMV7M_USEBASEPRI.  The Kconfig dependencies
		here will permit to select an invalid configuration because it
		cannot enforce that requirement.  If you create this invalild
		configuration, you will encounter some problems that may be
		very difficult to debug.

config ARMV7M_BASEPRI_WAR
	bool "Cortex-M7 r0p1 Errata 837070 Workaround"
	default n
	depends on ARMV7M_USEBASEPRI && ARCH_CORTEXM7
	---help---
		Enable workaround for r0p1 Errata 837070: Increasing priority using
		write to BASEPRI does not take effect immediately.

		This update is required to be serialized to the instruction stream
		meaning that after this update completes, it takes effect
		immediately and no exceptions of lower priority than the new boosted
		priority can preempt execution.  Because of this erratum, the
		priority boosting does not take place immediately, allowing the
		instruction after the MSR to be interrupted by an exception of
		lower priority than the new boosted priority. This effect is only
		limited to the next instruction. Subsequent instructions are
		guaranteed to see the new boosted priority.

config ARMV7M_STACKCHECK
	bool "Check for stack overflow on each function call"
	default n
	depends on ARMV7M_HAVE_STACKCHECK
	---help---
		This check uses R10 to check for a stack overflow within each
		function call. This has performances and code size impacts, but it
		will be able to catch hard to find stack overflows.

		Currently only available only for the STM32, SAM3/4 and SAMA5D
		architectures.  The changes are not complex and patches for
		other architectures will be accepted.

		This option requires that you are using a GCC toolchain and that
		you also include -finstrument-functions and -ffixed-r10 in your
		CFLAGS when you compile. This addition to your CFLAGS should probably
		be added to the definition of the CFFLAGS in your board Make.defs file.
