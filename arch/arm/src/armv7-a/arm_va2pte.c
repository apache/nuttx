 * Name: arm_va2pte
 *
 * Description:
 *  Convert a virtual address within the paged text region into a pointer to
 *  the corresponding page table entry.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   vaddr - The virtual address within the paged text region.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   A pointer to  the corresponding page table entry.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   - This function is called from the normal tasking context (but with
 *     interrupts disabled).  The implementation must take whatever actions
 *     are necessary to assure that the operation is safe within this
 *     context.
