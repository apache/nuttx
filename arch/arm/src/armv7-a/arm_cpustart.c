 * Name: up_cpu_start
 *
 * Description:
 *   In an SMP configution, only one CPU is initially active (CPU 0). System
 *   initialization occurs on that single thread. At the completion of the
 *   initialization of the OS, just before beginning normal multitasking,
 *   the additional CPUs would be started by calling this function.
 *
 *   Each CPU is provided the entry point to is IDLE task when started.  A
 *   TCB for each CPU's IDLE task has been initialized and placed in the
 *   CPU's g_assignedtasks[cpu] list.  Not stack has been allocated or
 *   initialized.
 *
 *   The OS initialization logic calls this function repeatedly until each
 *   CPU has been started, 1 through (CONFIG_SMP_NCPUS-1).
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   cpu - The index of the CPU being started.  This will be a numeric
 *         value in the range of from one to (CONFIG_SMP_NCPUS-1).  (CPU
 *         0 is already active)
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero on success; a negated errno value on failure.
