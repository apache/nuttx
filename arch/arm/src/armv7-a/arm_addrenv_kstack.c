/****************************************************************************
 * Address Environment Interfaces
 *
 * Low-level interfaces used in binfmt/ to instantiate tasks with address
 * environments.  These interfaces all operate on type group_addrenv_t which
 * is an abstract representation of a task group's address environment and
 * must be defined in arch/arch.h if CONFIG_ARCH_ADDRENV is defined.
 *
 *   up_addrenv_create   - Create an address environment
 *   up_addrenv_destroy  - Destroy an address environment.
 *   up_addrenv_vtext    - Returns the virtual base address of the .text
 *                         address environment
 *   up_addrenv_vdata    - Returns the virtual base address of the .bss/.data
 *                         address environment
 *   up_addrenv_heapsize - Returns the size of the initial heap allocation.
 *   up_addrenv_select   - Instantiate an address environment
 *   up_addrenv_restore  - Restore an address environment
 *   up_addrenv_clone    - Copy an address environment from one location to
 *                         another.
 *
 * Higher-level interfaces used by the tasking logic.  These interfaces are
 * used by the functions in sched/ and all operate on the thread which whose
 * group been assigned an address environment by up_addrenv_clone().
 *
 *   up_addrenv_attach   - Clone the address environment assigned to one TCB
 *                         to another.  This operation is done when a pthread
 *                         is created that share's the same group address
 *                         environment.
 *   up_addrenv_detach   - Release the thread's reference to an address
 *                         environment when a task/thread exits.
 *
 * CONFIG_ARCH_STACK_DYNAMIC=y indicates that the user process stack resides
 * in its own address space.  This options is also *required* if
 * CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL and CONFIG_LIBC_EXECFUNCS are selected.  Why?
 * Because the caller's stack must be preserved in its own address space
 * when we instantiate the environment of the new process in order to
 * initialize it.
 *
 * NOTE: The naming of the CONFIG_ARCH_STACK_DYNAMIC selection implies that
 * dynamic stack allocation is supported.  Certainly this option must be set
 * if dynamic stack allocation is supported by a platform.  But the more
 * general meaning of this configuration environment is simply that the
 * stack has its own address space.
 *
 * If CONFIG_ARCH_STACK_DYNAMIC=y is selected then the platform specific
 * code must export these additional interfaces:
 *
 *   up_addrenv_ustackalloc  - Create a stack address environment
 *   up_addrenv_ustackfree   - Destroy a stack address environment.
 *   up_addrenv_vustack      - Returns the virtual base address of the stack
 *   up_addrenv_ustackselect - Instantiate a stack address environment
 *
 * If CONFIG_ARCH_KERNEL_STACK is selected, then each user process will have
 * two stacks:  (1) a large (and possibly dynamic) user stack and (2) a
 * smaller kernel stack.  However, this option is *required* if both
 * CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL and CONFIG_LIBC_EXECFUNCS are selected.  Why?  Because
 * when we instantiate and initialize the address environment of the new
 * user process, we will temporarily lose the address environment of the old
 * user process, including its stack contents.  The kernel C logic will crash
 * immediately with no valid stack in place.
 *
 * If CONFIG_ARCH_KERNEL_STACK=y is selected then the platform specific
 * code must export these additional interfaces:
 *
 *   up_addrenv_kstackalloc  - Create a stack in the kernel address
 *                             environment
 *   up_addrenv_kstackfree   - Destroy the kernel stack.
 *   up_addrenv_vkstack      - Return the base address of the kernel stack

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: up_addrenv_kstackalloc

 * Description:
 *   This function is called when a new thread is created to allocate

 *   that case.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   tcb - The TCB of the thread that requires the kernel stack.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) on success; a negated errno value on failure.
