 * Name: cp15_coherent_dcache
 *
 * Description:
 *   Ensure that the I and D caches are coherent within specified region
 *   by cleaning the D cache (i.e., flushing the D cache contents to memory
 *   and invalidating the I cache. This is typically used when code has been
 *   written to a memory region, and will be executed.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   start - virtual start address of region
 *   end   - virtual end address of region + 1
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
