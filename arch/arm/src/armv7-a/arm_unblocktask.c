 * Name: up_unblock_task
 *
 * Description:
 *   A task is currently in an inactive task list
 *   but has been prepped to execute.  Move the TCB to the
 *   ready-to-run list, restore its context, and start execution.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   tcb: Refers to the tcb to be unblocked.  This tcb is
 *     in one of the waiting tasks lists.  It must be moved to
 *     the ready-to-run list and, if it is the highest priority
 *     ready to run task, executed.
