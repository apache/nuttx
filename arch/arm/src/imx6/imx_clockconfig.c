 * Description:
 *   Called to initialize the i.MX6.  This does whatever setup is needed to
 *   put the SoC in a usable state.  This includes the initialization of
 *   clocking using the settings in board.h.

  /* Don't change the current basic clock configuration if we are running

   * way that the bootloader has left them.
   *
   * Clocking will be configured at 792 MHz initially when started via
   * U-Boot.  The Linux kernel will uses the CPU frequency scaling code
   * which will switch the processor frequency between 400 MHz and 1GHz based
   * on load and temperature.  For now, NuttX simply leaves the clocking at
   * 792MHz.
