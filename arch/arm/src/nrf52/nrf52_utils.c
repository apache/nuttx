 * Name: nrf52_clrpend
 *
 * Description:
 *   Clear a pending interrupt at the NVIC.  This does not seem to be
 *   required for most interrupts.
 *
 *   This function is logically a part of nrf52_irq.c, but I will keep it in
 *   a separate file so that it will not increase the footprint on NRF52
 *   platforms that do not need this function.
