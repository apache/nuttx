 * Name: up_idle
 *
 * Description:
 *   up_idle() is the logic that will be executed when there is no other
 *   ready-to-run task.  This is processor idle time and will continue until
 *   some interrupt occurs to cause a context switch from the idle task.
 *
 *   Processing in this state may be processor-specific. e.g., this is where
 *   power management operations might be performed.

 * Name: up_cpu_idlestack
 *
 * Description:
 *   Allocate a stack for the CPU[n] IDLE task (n > 0) if appropriate and
 *   setup up stack-related information in the IDLE task's TCB.  This
 *   function is always called before up_cpu_start().  This function is
 *   only called for the CPU's initial IDLE task; up_create_task is used for
 *   all normal tasks, pthreads, and kernel threads for all CPUs.
 *
 *   The initial IDLE task is a special case because the CPUs can be started
 *   in different wans in different environments:
 *
 *   1. The CPU may already have been started and waiting in a low power
 *      state for up_cpu_start().  In this case, the IDLE thread's stack
 *      has already been allocated and is already in use.  Here
 *      up_cpu_idlestack() only has to provide information about the
 *      already allocated stack.
 *
 *   2. The CPU may be disabled but started when up_cpu_start() is called.
 *      In this case, a new stack will need to be created for the IDLE
 *      thread and this function is then equivalent to:
 *
 *      return up_create_stack(tcb, stack_size, TCB_FLAG_TTYPE_KERNEL);
 *
 *   The following TCB fields must be initialized by this function:
 *
 *   - adj_stack_size: Stack size after adjustment for hardware, processor,
 *     etc.  This value is retained only for debug purposes.
 *   - stack_alloc_ptr: Pointer to allocated stack
 *   - adj_stack_ptr: Adjusted stack_alloc_ptr for HW.  The initial value of
 *     the stack pointer.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   - cpu:         CPU index that indicates which CPU the IDLE task is
 *                  being created for.
 *   - tcb:         The TCB of new CPU IDLE task
 *   - stack_size:  The requested stack size for the IDLE task.  At least
 *                  this much must be allocated.  This should be
 *                  CONFIG_SMP_STACK_SIZE.
