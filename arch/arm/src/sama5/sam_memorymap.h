/* The vectors are, by default, positioned at the beginning of the text
 * section.  Under what conditions do we have to remap these vectors?
 *
 * 1) If we are using high vectors (CONFIG_ARCH_LOWVECTORS=n).  In this case,
 *    the vectors will lie at virtual address 0xffff:000 and we will need
 *    to a) copy the vectors to another location, and b) map the vectors
 *    to that address, and
 *
 *    For the case of CONFIG_ARCH_LOWVECTORS=y, defined.  The SAMA5 boot-up
 *    logic will map the beginning of the boot memory to address 0x0000:0000
 *    using both the MMU and the AXI matrix REMAP register.  No vector copy
 *    is required because the vectors are position at the beginning of the
 *    boot memory at link time and no additional MMU mapping required.
 *
 * 2) We are not using a ROM page table.  We cannot set any custom mappings in
 *    the case and the build must conform to the ROM page table properties
