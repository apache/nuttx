  /* If CONFIG_ARCH_LOWVECTORS is defined, then the vectors located at the
   * beginning of the .text region must appear at address at the address
   * specified in the VBAR.  There are three ways to accomplish this:
   *
   *   1. By explicitly mapping the beginning of .text region with a page
   *      table entry so that the virtual address zero maps to the beginning
   *      of the .text region.  VBAR == 0x0000:0000.
   *
   *   2. A second way is to map the use the AXI MATRIX remap register to
   *      map physical address zero to the beginning of the text region,
   *      either internal SRAM or EBI CS 0.  Then we can set an identity
   *      mapping to map the boot region at 0x0000:0000 to virtual address
   *      0x0000:00000.   VBAR == 0x0000:0000.
   *
   *      This method is used when booting from ISRAM or NOR FLASH.  In
   *      that case, vectors must lie at the beginning of NOFR FLASH.
   *
   *   3. Set the Cortex-A5 VBAR register so that the vector table address
   *      is moved to a location other than 0x0000:0000.
   *
   *      This is the method used when booting from SDRAM.
   *
   * - When executing from NOR FLASH, the first level bootloader is supposed
   *   to provide the AXI MATRIX mapping for us at boot time base on the state
   *   of the BMS pin.  However, I have found that in the test environments
   *   that I use, I cannot always be assured of that physical address mapping.
   *
   *   So we do both here.  If we are executing from NOR FLASH, then we provide
   *   the MMU to map the physical address of FLASH to address 0x0000:0000;
   *
   * - If we are executing out of ISRAM, then the SAMA5 primary bootloader
   *   probably copied us into ISRAM and set the AXI REMAP bit for us.
   *
   * - If we are executing from external SDRAM, then a secondary bootloader must
   *   have loaded us into SDRAM.  In this case, simply set the VBAR register
   *   to the address of the vector table (not necessary at the beginning
   *   or SDRAM).
