 * Name: lpc31_esrndx
 *
 * Description:
 *   Given a clock ID, return the index of the corresponding ESR
 *   register (or ESRNDX_INVALID if there is no ESR associated with
 *   this clock ID).  Indexing of ESRs differs slightly from the clock
 *   ID:  There are 92 clock IDs but only 89 ESR regisers. There are no
 *   ESR registers for:
 *
 *  CLKID_I2SRXBCK0         Clock ID 87: I2SRX_BCK0
 *  CLKID_I2SRXBCK1,        Clock ID 88: I2SRX_BCK1
 *
 * and
 *
 *  CLKID_SYSCLKO           Clock ID 91: SYSCLK_O
 *
