/* NVIC priority levels *************************************************************/
/* Each priority field holds a priority value.  The lower the value, the greater the
 * priority of the corresponding interrupt.  The XMC4500 implements only bits[7:2]
 * of this field, bits[1:0] read as zero and ignore writes.
 */

#define NVIC_SYSH_PRIORITY_MIN     0xfc /* All bits[7:2] set is minimum priority */
#define NVIC_SYSH_PRIORITY_DEFAULT 0x80 /* Midpoint is the default */
#define NVIC_SYSH_PRIORITY_MAX     0x00 /* Zero is maximum priority */
#define NVIC_SYSH_PRIORITY_STEP    0x04 /* Steps between supported priority values */

/* If CONFIG_ARMV7M_USEBASEPRI is selected, then interrupts will be disabled
 * by setting the BASEPRI register to NVIC_SYSH_DISABLE_PRIORITY so that most
 * interrupts will not have execution priority.  SVCall must have execution
 * priority in all cases.
 *
 * In the normal cases, interrupts are not nest-able and all interrupts run
 * at an execution priority between NVIC_SYSH_PRIORITY_MIN and
 * NVIC_SYSH_PRIORITY_MAX (with NVIC_SYSH_PRIORITY_MAX reserved for SVCall).
 *
 * If, in addition, CONFIG_ARCH_HIPRI_INTERRUPT is defined, then special
 * high priority interrupts are supported.  These are not "nested" in the
 * normal sense of the word.  These high priority interrupts can interrupt
 * normal processing but execute outside of OS (although they can "get back
 * into the game" via a PendSV interrupt).
 *
 * In the normal course of things, interrupts must occasionally be disabled
 * using the up_irq_save() inline function to prevent contention in use of
 * resources that may be shared between interrupt level and non-interrupt
 * level logic.  Now the question arises, if CONFIG_ARCH_HIPRI_INTERRUPT,
 * do we disable all interrupts (except SVCall), or do we only disable the
 * "normal" interrupts.  Since the high priority interrupts cannot interact
 * with the OS, you may want to permit the high priority interrupts even if
 * interrupts are disabled.  The setting CONFIG_ARCH_INT_DISABLEALL can be
 * used to select either behavior:
 *
 *   ----------------------------+--------------+----------------------------
 *   CONFIG_ARCH_HIPRI_INTERRUPT |      NO      |             YES
 *   ----------------------------+--------------+--------------+-------------
 *   CONFIG_ARCH_INT_DISABLEALL  |     N/A      |     YES      |      NO
 *   ----------------------------+--------------+--------------+-------------
 *                               |              |              |    SVCall
 *                               |    SVCall    |    SVCall    |    HIGH
 *   Disable here and below --------> MAXNORMAL ---> HIGH --------> MAXNORMAL
 *                               |              |    MAXNORMAL |
