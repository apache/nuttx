/****************************************************************************
 * Name: up_tls_info
 *
 * Description:
 *   Return the TLS information structure for the currently executing thread.
 *   When TLS is enabled, up_createstack() will align allocated stacks to
 *   the TLS_STACK_ALIGN value.  An instance of the following structure will
 *   be implicitly positioned at the "lower" end of the stack.  Assuming a
 *   "push down" stack, this is at the "far" end of the stack (and can be
 *   clobbered if the stack overflows).
 *
 *   If an MCU has a "push up" then that TLS structure will lie at the top
 *   of the stack and stack allocation and initialization logic must take
 *   care to preserve this structure content.
 *
 *   The stack memory is fully accessible to user mode threads.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   A pointer to TLS info structure at the beginning of the STACK memory
 *   allocation.  This is essentially an application of the TLS_INFO(sp)
 *   macro and has a platform dependency only in the manner in which the
 *   stack pointer (sp) is obtained and interpreted.
