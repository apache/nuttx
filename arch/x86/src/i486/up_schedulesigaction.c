 * Name: up_schedule_sigaction
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is called by the OS when one or more signal handling
 *   actions have been queued for execution.  The architecture specific code
 *   must configure things so that the 'sigdeliver' callback is executed on
 *   the thread specified by 'tcb' as soon as possible.
 *
 *   This function may be called from interrupt handling logic.
 *
 *   This operation should not cause the task to be unblocked nor should it
 *   cause any immediate execution of sigdeliver. Typically, a few cases need
 *   to be considered:
 *
 *   (1) This function may be called from an interrupt handler. During
 *       interrupt processing, all xcptcontext structures should be valid for
 *       all tasks.  That structure should be modified to invoke sigdeliver()
 *       either on return from (this) interrupt or on some subsequent context
 *       switch to the recipient task.
 *   (2) If not in an interrupt handler and the tcb is NOT the currently
 *       executing task, then again just modify the saved xcptcontext
 *       structure for the recipient task so it will invoke sigdeliver when
 *       that task is later resumed.
 *   (3) If not in an interrupt handler and the tcb IS the currently
 *       executing task -- just call the signal handler now.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   Called from critical section
 *
