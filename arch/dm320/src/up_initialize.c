 * Name: up_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   up_initialize will be called once during OS
 *   initialization after the basic OS services have been
 *   initialized.  The architecture specific details of
 *   initializing the OS will be handled here.  Such things as
 *   setting up interrupt service routines, starting the
 *   clock, and registering device drivers are some of the
 *   things that are different for each processor and hardware
 *   platform.
 *
 *   up_initialize is called after the OS initialized but
 *   before the init process has been started and before the
 *   libraries have been initialized.  OS services and driver
 *   services are available.
