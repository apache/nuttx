 * Name: up_fullcontextrestore
 *
 * Description:
 *   Restore the full-running contex of a thread.
 *
 *   NOTE: Thus function must handle one very strange case.  That is when
 *   this function is called with up_sigdeliver().  That case is strange in
 *   two ways:
 *
 *   1. It is not a context switch between threads.  Rather, up_fullcontextrestore
 *      must behave more it more like a longjmp within the same task, using the
 *      same stack.
 *   2. In this case, this function is called with r12 pointing to a register
 *      save area on the stack to be destroyed.  This is dangerous for two
 *      reasons: (a) there is a period of time where the stack contents still
 *      contain valid data, but are outside of range protected by the stack
 *      pointer (hence, interrupts must be disabled), and (b) there is the
 *      very real possibility that the new stack pointer might overlap with
 *      the register save area and stack usage in this function might corrupt
 *      the register save data before the state is restored.  It turns that
 *      an extra 3 words in the register save structure size will protect its
 *      contents (because that is the number of temporaries pushed onto the
 *      stack).
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   r12 = A pointer to the register save area of the thread to be restored.
 *
 * C Prototype:
 *  void up_fullcontextrestore(uint32_t *regs);
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   Interrupts are disabled.
