# Setup for the selected toolchain

#
# Since all of the supported toolchains are variants of the Atmel-patched
# GCC, the only interesting question to answer here is whether or not
# the build is hosted on Windows, and how to override the configuration.
#
# NOTE: There is a logic error in the following:  CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS means
# that we are operating on a Windows platform.  But in the case where we
# have an AVR32 toolchain built under Cygwin, the correct setting would be
# GNU, not AVRTOOLSW.
