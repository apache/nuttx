 * Name: up_release_stack
 *
 * Description:
 *   A task has been stopped. Free all stack related resources retained in
 *   the defunct TCB.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   - dtcb:  The TCB containing information about the stack to be released
 *   - ttype:  The thread type.  This may be one of following (defined in
 *     include/nuttx/sched.h):
 *
 *       TCB_FLAG_TTYPE_TASK     Normal user task
 *       TCB_FLAG_TTYPE_PTHREAD  User pthread
 *       TCB_FLAG_TTYPE_KERNEL   Kernel thread
 *
 *     This thread type is normally available in the flags field of the TCB,
 *     however, there are certain error recovery contexts where the TCB may
 *     not be fully initialized when up_release_stack is called.
 *
 *     If CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL is defined, then this thread type may affect
 *     how the stack is freed.  For example, kernel thread stacks may have
 *     been allocated from protected kernel memory.  Stacks for user tasks
 *     and threads must have come from memory that is accessible to user
 *     code.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
 *
