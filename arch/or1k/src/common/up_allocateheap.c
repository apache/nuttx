/* Terminology.  In the flat build (CONFIG_BUILD_FLAT=y), there is only a
 * single heap access with the standard allocations (malloc/free).  This
 * heap is referred to as the user heap.  In the protected build
 * (CONFIG_BUILD_PROTECTED=y) where an MPU is used to protect a region of
 * otherwise flat memory, there will be two allocators:  One that allocates
 * protected (kernel) memory and one that allocates unprotected (user)
 * memory.  These are referred to as the kernel and user heaps,
 * respectively.

 * Name: up_allocate_heap/up_allocate_kheap
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function will be called to dynamically set aside the heap region.
 *
 *   - For the normal "flat" build, this function returns the size of the
 *     single heap.
 *   - For the protected build (CONFIG_BUILD_PROTECTED=y) with both kernel-
 *     and user-space heaps (CONFIG_MM_KERNEL_HEAP=y), this function
 *     provides the size of the unprotected, user-space heap.
 *   - For the kernel build (CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL=y), this function provides
 *     the size of the protected, kernel-space heap.
 *
 *   If a protected kernel-space heap is provided, the kernel heap must be
 *   allocated by an analogous up_allocate_kheap(). A custom version of this
 *   file is needed if memory protection of the kernel heap is required.
 *
 *   The following memory map is assumed for the flat build:
 *
 *     .data region.  Size determined at link time.
 *     .bss  region  Size determined at link time.
 *     IDLE thread stack.  Size determined by CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE.
 *     Heap.  Extends to the end of SRAM.
 *
 *   The following memory map is assumed for the kernel build:
 *
 *     Kernel .data region.  Size determined at link time.
 *     Kernel .bss  region  Size determined at link time.
 *     Kernel IDLE thread stack.  Size determined by CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE.
 *     Padding for alignment
 *     User .data region.  Size determined at link time.
 *     User .bss region  Size determined at link time.
 *     Kernel heap.  Size determined by CONFIG_MM_KERNEL_HEAPSIZE.
 *     User heap.  Extends to the end of SRAM.
