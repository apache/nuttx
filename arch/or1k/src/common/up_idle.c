 * Name: up_idle
 *
 * Description:
 *   up_idle() is the logic that will be executed when there is no other
 *   ready-to-run task.  This is processor idle time and will continue until
 *   some interrupt occurs to cause a context switch from the idle task.
 *
 *   Processing in this state may be processor-specific. e.g., this is where
 *   power management operations might be performed.
 *
