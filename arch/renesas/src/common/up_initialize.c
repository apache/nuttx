 * Name: up_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   up_initialize will be called once during OS initialization after the
 *   basic OS services have been initialized.  The architecture specific
 *   details of initializing the OS will be handled here.  Such things as
 *   setting up interrupt service routines, starting the clock, and
 *   registering device drivers are some of the things that are different
 *   for each processor and hardware platform.
 *
 *   up_initialize is called after the OS initialized but before the user
 *   initialization logic has been started and before the libraries have
 *   been initialized.  OS services and driver services are available.
 *
