 * Tickless OS Support.
 *
 * When CONFIG_SCHED_TICKLESS is enabled, all support for timer interrupts
 * is suppressed and the platform specific code is expected to provide the
 * following custom functions.
 *
 *   void up_timer_initialize(void): Initializes the timer facilities.
 *     Called early in the initialization sequence (by up_initialize()).
 *   int up_timer_gettime(FAR struct timespec *ts):  Returns the current
 *     time from the platform specific time source.
 *   int up_timer_cancel(void):  Cancels the interval timer.
 *   int up_timer_start(FAR const struct timespec *ts): Start (or re-starts)
 *     the interval timer.
 *
 * The RTOS will provide the following interfaces for use by the platform-
 * specific interval timer implementation:
 *
 *   void nxsched_timer_expiration(void):  Called by the platform-specific
 *     logic when the interval timer expires.

/****************************************************************************
 * BM3803 Timer Usage
 *
 * This current implementation uses two timers:  A one-shot timer to provide
 * the timed events and a free running timer to provide the current time.
 * Since timers are a limited resource, that could be an issue on some
 * systems.
 *
 * We could do the job with a single timer if we were to keep the single
 * timer in a free-running at all times.  The STM32 timer/counters have
 * 16-bit/32-bit counters with the capability to generate a compare interrupt
 * when the timer matches a compare value but also to continue counting
 * without stopping (giving another, different interrupt when the timer
 * rolls over from 0xffffffff to zero).  So we could potentially just set
 * the compare at the number of ticks you want PLUS the current value of
 * timer.  Then you could have both with a single timer:  An interval timer
 * and a free-running counter with the same timer!
 *
 * Patches are welcome!

 * Name: up_timer_gettime
 *
 * Description:

 *      int clock_gettime(clockid_t clockid, FAR struct timespec *ts);

 *   when clockid is CLOCK_MONOTONIC.
 *
 *   This function provides the basis for reporting the current time and

 *   time calculations.
 *
 *   Provided by platform-specific code and called from the RTOS base code.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   ts - Provides the location in which to return the up-time.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success; a negated errno value is returned on
 *   any failure.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   Called from the normal tasking context.  The implementation must
 *   provide whatever mutual exclusion is necessary for correct operation.
 *   This can include disabling interrupts in order to assure atomic register
 *   operations.

 *
 * Description:
 *   Cancel the interval timer and return the time remaining on the timer.
 *   These two steps need to be as nearly atomic as possible.
 *   nxsched_timer_expiration() will not be called unless the timer is
 *   restarted with up_timer_start().
 *
 *   If, as a race condition, the timer has already expired when this
 *   function is called, then that pending interrupt must be cleared so
 *   that up_timer_start() and the remaining time of zero should be
 *   returned.
 *
 *   NOTE: This function may execute at a high rate with no timer running (as
 *   when pre-emption is enabled and disabled).
 *
 *   Provided by platform-specific code and called from the RTOS base code.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   ts - Location to return the remaining time.  Zero should be returned
 *        if the timer is not active.  ts may be zero in which case the
 *        time remaining is not returned.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success.  A call to up_timer_cancel() when
 *   the timer is not active should also return success; a negated errno
 *   value is returned on any failure.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   May be called from interrupt level handling or from the normal tasking
 *   level.  Interrupts may need to be disabled internally to assure
 *   non-reentrancy.
