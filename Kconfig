		Use the mklink command to set up symbolic links when NuttX is

		If directories are copied, then some confusion can result ("Which
		version of the file did I modify?").  In that case, it is recommended
		that you re-build using 'make clean_context all'.  That will cause the
		configured directories to be recopied on each build.

		NOTE: This option also (1) that you have administrator privileges, (2)
		that you are using Windows 2000 or better, and (3) that you are using
		the NTFS file system.  Select 'n' is that is not the case.

	---help---
		Identifies the directory that builds the
		application to link with NuttX.  Default: ../apps This symbol must
		be assigned to the path to the application build directory
		*relative* to the NuttX top build directory. If you had an
		application directory and the NuttX directory each in separate
		directory trees like this:

			build
			|-nuttx
			|  |
			|  `- Makefile
			`-application
			|
			`- Makefile

		Then you would set APPS_DIR=../application.

		The application direction must contain Makefile and this make
		file must support the following targets:

		1)libapps$(LIBEXT) (usually libapps.a). libapps.a is a static
		library ( an archive) that contains all of application object
		files.

		2)clean. Do whatever is appropriate to clean the application
		directories for a fresh build.

		3)distclean. Clean everything -- auto-generated files, symbolic
		links etc. -- so that the directory contents are the same as
		the contents in your configuration management system.
		This is only done when you change the NuttX configuration.

		4)depend. Make or update the application build dependencies.

		When this application is invoked it will receive the setting TOPDIR like:

		$(MAKE) -C $(CONFIG_APPS_DIR) TOPDIR="$(TOPDIR)" <target>

		TOPDIR is the full path to the NuttX directory. It can be used, for
		example, to include makefile fragments (e.g., .config or Make.defs)
		or to set up include file paths.

		privileged kernel blob and a separate unprivileged, user blob.  This
		requires use of the two pass build with each blob being build on
		each pass.

		NOTE:  This build configuration requires that the platform support

		built.  All user applications must reside in a file system where
		they can be loaded into memory for execution.

		is assumed to be an incremental (relative) link object, but could be a static
		library (archive) (some modification to this Makefile would be required if
		PASS1_TARGET generates an archive). Pass 1 1ncremental (relative) link

		The stdint.h header file can be found at nuttx/include/stdint.h.
		However, that header includes logic to redirect the inclusion of an
		architecture specific header file like:

			#ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_STDINT_H
			#  include <arch/stdint.h>
			#else
			...
			#endif

		Recall that that include path, include/arch, is a symbolic link and
		will refer to a version of stdint.h at nuttx/arch/<architecture>/include/stdint.h.

config ARCH_HAVE_STDBOOL_H
	bool
	default n

		Selected by architecture specific logic if the architecture provides
		a stdbool.h header file.

config ARCH_STDBOOL_H

	---help---
		The stdbool.h header file can be found at nuttx/include/stdbool.h.

		architecture specific header file like:

			#ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_STDBOOL_H
			#  include <arch/stdbool.h>
			#else

			#endif

		Recall that that include path, include/arch, is a symbolic link and

config ARCH_HAVE_MATH_H

	default n
	---help---
		Selected by architecture specific logic if the architecture provides
		a math.h header file.

config ARCH_MATH_H
	bool "math.h"
	depends on ARCH_HAVE_MATH_H
	default n
	---help---
		There is also a re-directing version of math.h in the source tree.
		However, it resides out-of-the-way at include/nuttx/lib/math.h because it
		conflicts too often with the system math.h. If ARCH_MATH_H=y is
		defined, however, the top-level makefile will copy the redirecting
		math.h header file from include/nuttx/lib/math.h to include/math.h. math.h
		will then include the architecture-specific version of math.h that you
		must provide at nuttx/arch/>architecture</include/math.h.

			#ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_MATH_H
			#  include <arch/math.h>
			#endif

		So for the architectures that define ARCH_MATH_H=y, include/math.h
		will be the redirecting math.h header file; for the architectures
		that don't select ARCH_MATH_H, the redirecting math.h header file
		will stay out-of-the-way in include/nuttx/.

config ARCH_FLOAT_H
	bool "float.h"

		The float.h header file defines the properties of your floating
		point implementation.  It would always be best to use your

		float.h header file will provided if this option is selected.  However
		there is no assurance that the settings in this float.h are actually
		correct for your platform!

config ARCH_STDARG_H
	bool "stdarg.h"
	depends on ARCH_HAVE_STDARG_H
	default n
	---help---
		There is a redirecting version of stdarg.h in the source tree. It
		resides out-of-the-way at include/nuttx/lib/stdarg.h.  This is
		because you should normally use your toolchain's stdarg.h file. But
		sometimes, your toolchain's stdarg.h file may have other header
		file dependencies and so may not be usable in the NuttX build
		environment. In those cases, you may have to create a architecture-
		specific stdarg.h header file at nuttx/arch/<architecture>/include/stdarg.h

		If ARCH_STDARG_H=y is defined, the top-level makefile will copy the
		re-directing stdarg.h header file from include/nuttx/lib/stdarg.h to
		include/stdarg.h. So for the architectures that cannot use their
		toolchain's stdarg.h file, they can use this alternative by defining
		ARCH_STDARG_H=y and providing. If ARCH_STDARG_H, is not defined, then
