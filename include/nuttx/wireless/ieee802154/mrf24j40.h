/* The MRF24J40 provides interrupts to the MCU via a GPIO pin.  The
 * following structure provides an MCU-independent mechanism for controlling
 * the MRF24J40 GPIO interrupt.
 *
 * The MRF24J40 interrupt is an active low, *level* interrupt.
 * From Datasheet:
 * "Note 1: The INTEDGE polarity defaults to:
 *
 *   0 = Falling Edge. Ensure that the interrupt polarity matches the
 *       interrupt pin polarity of the host microcontroller.
 *
 *  Note 2: The INT pin will remain high or low, depending on INTEDGE
 *   polarity setting, until INTSTAT register is read."

 * Name: mrf24j40_init
 *
 * Description:
 *   Initialize the IEEE802.15.4 driver. The MRF24J40 device is assumed to
 *   be in the post-reset state upon entry to this function.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   spi   - A reference to the platform's SPI driver for the MRF24J40
 *   lower - The MCU-specific interrupt used to control low-level MCU
 *           functions (i.e., MRF24J40 GPIO interrupts).
 *   devno - If more than one MRF24J40 is supported, then this is the
 *           zero based number that identifies the MRF24J40;
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK on success; Negated errno on failure.
 *
 * Assumptions:
