/****************************************************************************
 * Name: xbee_init
 *
 * Description:
 *   Initialize an XBee driver.  The XBee device is assumed to be
 *   in the post-reset state upon entry to this function.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   spi   - A reference to the platform's SPI driver for the XBee
 *   lower - The MCU-specific interrupt used to control low-level MCU
 *           functions (i.e., XBee GPIO interrupts).
 *   devno - If more than one XBee is supported, then this is the
 *           zero based number that identifies the XBee;
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK on success; Negated errno on failure.
 *
 * Assumptions:
