/* Most internal nxsig_* interfaces are not available in the user space in
 * PROTECTED and KERNEL builds.  In that context, the application signal
 * interfaces must be used.  The differences between the two sets of
 * interfaces are:  (1) the nxsig_* interfaces do not cause cancellation
 * points and (2) they do not modify the errno variable.
 *
 * This is only important when compiling libraries (libc or libnx) that are
 * used both by the OS (libkc.a and libknx.a) or by the applications
 * (libc.a and libnx.a).  In that case, the correct interface must be
 * used for the build context.
 *
 * REVISIT:  In the flat build, the same functions must be used both by
 * the OS and by applications.  We have to use the normal user functions
 * in this case or we will fail to set the errno or fail to create the
 * cancellation point.
 *
 * The interfaces sigtimedwait(), sigwait(), sigwaitinfo(), sleep(),
 * nanosleep(), and usleep()  are cancellation points.
 *
 * REVISIT:  The fact that these interfaces are cancellation points is an
 * issue and may cause violations:  It use of these internally will cause
 * the calling function to become a cancellation points!

 *
