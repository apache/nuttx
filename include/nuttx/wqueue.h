/* Configuration ************************************************************/

/* CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE.  Not selectable.  Set by the configuration system
 *   if either CONFIG_SCHED_HPWORK or CONFIG_SCHED_LPWORK are selected.
 * CONFIG_SCHED_HPWORK.  Create a dedicated "worker" thread to
 *   handle delayed processing from interrupt handlers.  This feature
 *   is required for some drivers but, if there are not complaints,
 *   can be safely disabled.  The worker thread also performs
 *   from interrupt handlers.  If the worker thread is disabled,
 *   then that clean will be performed by the IDLE thread instead
 *   (which runs at the lowest of priority and may not be appropriate
 *   if memory reclamation is of high priority).  If CONFIG_SCHED_HPWORK
 *   is enabled, then the following options can also be used:
 * CONFIG_SCHED_HPNTHREADS - The number of thread in the high-priority
 *   queue's thread pool.  Default: 1
 * CONFIG_SCHED_HPWORKPRIORITY - The execution priority of the high-
 *   priority worker thread.  Default: 224
 * CONFIG_SCHED_HPWORKSTACKSIZE - The stack size allocated for the worker
 *   thread.  Default: 2048.
 * CONFIG_SIG_SIGWORK - The signal number that will be used to wake-up
 *   the worker thread.  Default: 17
 *
 * CONFIG_SCHED_LPWORK. If CONFIG_SCHED_LPWORK is selected then a lower-
 *   priority work queue will be created.  This lower priority work queue
 *   is better suited for more extended processing (such as file system
 *   clean-up operations)
 * CONFIG_SCHED_LPNTHREADS - The number of thread in the low-priority queue's
 *   thread pool.  Default: 1
 * CONFIG_SCHED_LPWORKPRIORITY - The minimum execution priority of the lower
 *   priority worker thread.  Default: 50
 * CONFIG_SCHED_LPWORKPRIOMAX - The maximum execution priority of the lower
 *   priority worker thread.  Default: 176
 * CONFIG_SCHED_LPWORKSTACKSIZE - The stack size allocated for the lower
 *   priority worker thread.  Default: 2048.
 *
 * The user-mode work queue is only available in the protected or kernel
 * builds.  This those configurations, the user-mode work queue provides the
 * same (non-standard) facility for use by applications.
 *
 * CONFIG_LIB_USRWORK. If CONFIG_LIB_USRWORK is also defined then the
 *   user-mode work queue will be created.
 * CONFIG_LIB_USRWORKPRIORITY - The minimum execution priority of the lower
 *   priority worker thread.  Default: 100
 * CONFIG_LIB_USRWORKSTACKSIZE - The stack size allocated for the lower
 *   priority worker thread.  Default: 2048.

 * Name: work_queue
 *
 * Description:
 *   Queue work to be performed at a later time.  All queued work will be

 *
 *   The work structure is allocated and must be initialized to all zero by
 *   the caller.  Otherwise, the work structure is completely managed by the

 *   pending work will be canceled and lost.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   qid    - The work queue ID
 *   work   - The work structure to queue
 *   worker - The worker callback to be invoked.  The callback will invoked
 *            on the worker thread of execution.
 *   arg    - The argument that will be passed to the worker callback when
 *            it is invoked.
 *   delay  - Delay (in clock ticks) from the time queue until the worker
 *            is invoked. Zero means to perform the work immediately.
