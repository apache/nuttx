/* 6.1.1 ProtocolVersion
 *
 * "Handshaking begins by the server sending the client a ProtocolVersion
 *  message. This lets the client know which is the highest RFB protocol
 *  version number supported by the server. The client then replies with a
 *  similar message giving the version number of the protocol which should
 *  actually be used (which may be different to that quoted by the server).
 *  A client should never request a protocol version higher than that
 *  offered by the server. It is intended that both clients and servers may
 *  provide some level of backwards compatibility by this mechanism.
 *
 * "The only published protocol versions at this time are 3.3, 3.7, 3.8
 *  (version 3.5 was wrongly reported by some clients, but this should be
 *  interpreted by all servers as 3.3). Addition of a new encoding or
 *  pseudo-encoding type does not require a change in protocol version,
 *  since a server can simply ignore encodings it does not understand.
 *
 * "The ProtocolVersion message consists of 12 bytes interpreted as a string
 *  of ASCII characters in the format "RFB xxx.yyy\n" where xxx and yyy are
 *  the major and minor version numbers, padded with zeros."

/* "The interpretation of keysyms is a complex area. In order to be as
 * widely interoperable as possible the following guidelines should be
 * used:
 *
 *   - "The 'shift state' (i.e. whether either of the Shift keysyms are down)
 *      should only be used as a hint when interpreting a keysym. For
 *      example, on a US keyboard the ’#’ character is shifted, but on a
 *      UK keyboard it is not. A server with a US keyboard receiving a
 *      ’#’ character from a client with a UK keyboard will not have been
 *      sentany shift presses.
 *      In this case, it is likely that the server will internally need to
 *      'fake' a shift press on its local system, in order to get a ’#’
 *      character and not, for example, a ’3’.
 *   - "The difference between upper and lower case keysyms is significant.
 *      This is unlike some of the keyboard processing in the X Window
 *      System which treats them as the same. For example, a server receiving
 *      an uppercase ’A’ keysym without any shift presses should
 *      interpret it as an uppercase ’A’.
 *      Again this may involve an internal ’fake’ shift press.
 *   - "Servers should ignore 'lock' keysyms such as CapsLock and NumLock
 *      where possible. Instead they should interpret each character-based
 *      keysym according to its case.
 *   - "Unlike Shift, the state of modifier keys such as Control and Alt
 *      should be taken as modifying the interpretation of other keysyms.
 *      Note that there are no keysyms for ASCII control characters such
 *      as ctrl-a - these should be generated by viewers sending a Control
 *      press followed by an ’a’ press.
 *   - "On a viewer where modifiers like Control and Alt can also be used to
 *      generate character-based keysyms, the viewer may need to send extra
 *      'release' events in order that the keysym is interpreted correctly.
 *      For example, on a German PC keyboard, ctrl-alt-q generates the "@"
 *      character. In this case, the viewer needs to send 'fake' release
 *      events for Control and Alt in order that the ’@’ character is
 *      interpreted correctly (ctrl-alt-@is likely to mean something
 *      completely different to the server).
 *   - "There is no universal standard for 'backward tab' in the X Window
 *      System. On some systems shift+tab gives the keysym 'ISO Left Tab',
 *      on others it gives a private 'BackTab' keysym and on others it gives
 *      'Tab' and applications tell from the shift state that it means
 *      backward-tab rather than forward-tab. In the RFB protocol the latter
 *      approach is preferred. Viewers should generate a shifted Tab rather
 *      than ISO Left Tab. However, to be backwards-compatible with existing
 *      viewers, servers should also recognise ISO Left Tab as meaning a

/* 6.6.1 Raw encoding
 *
 * "The simplest encoding type is raw pixel data. In this case the data
 *  consists of width x height pixel values (where width and height are the
 *  width and height of the rectangle).  The values simply represent each
 *  pixel in left-to-right scanline order. All RFB clients must be able to
 *  cope with pixel data in this raw encoding, and RFB servers should only
 *  produce raw encoding unless the client specifically asks for some other
 *  encoding type.
 */

/* 6.6.2 CopyRect encoding
 *
 * "The CopyRect (copy rectangle) encoding is a very simple and efficient
 *  encoding which can be used when the client already has the same pixel
 *  data elsewhere in its framebuffer.  The encoding on the wire simply
 *  consists of an X,Y coordinate. This gives a position in the framebuffer
 *  from which the client can copy the rectangle of pixel data. This can be
 *  used in a variety of situations, the most obvious of which are when the
 *  user moves a window across the screen, and when the contents of a window
 *  are scrolled. A less obvious use is for optimising drawing of text or
 *  other repeating patterns. An intelligent server may be able to send a
 *  pattern explicitly only once, and knowing the previous position of the
 *  pattern in the framebuffer, send subsequent occurrences of the same
 *  pattern using the CopyRect encoding."

/* 6.6.3 RRE encoding
 *

 *  rendered immediately and efficiently by the simplest of graphics
 *  engines. RRE is not appropriate for complex desktops, but can be
 *  useful in some situations.
 *
 * "The basic idea behind RRE is the partitioning of a rectangle of pixel
 *  data into rectangular subregions (subrectangles) each of which consists
 *  of pixels of a single value and the union of which comprises the
 *  original rectangular region. The near-optimal partition of a given
 *  rectangle into such subrectangles is relatively easy to compute.
 *
 * "The encoding consists of a background pixel value, Vb (typically the
 *  most prevalent pixel value in the rectangle) and a count N, followed
 *  by a list of N subrectangles, each of which consists of a tuple
 *  < v, x, y, w, h > where v (6= Vb) is the pixel value, (x, y) are the
 *  coordinates of the subrectangle relative to the top-left corner of the
 *  rectangle, and (w, h) are the width and height of the subrectangle. The
 *  client can render the original rectangle by drawing a filled rectangle
 *  of the background pixel value and then drawing a filled rectangle
 *  corresponding to each subrectangle. On the wire, the data begins with

 *  into tiles starting at the top left going in left-to-right, top-to-
 *  bottom order. The encoded contents of the tiles simply follow one another

 *  an exact multiple of 16 then the width of the last tile in each row will
 *  be correspondingly smaller. Similarly if the height of the whole
 *  rectangle is not an exact multiple of 16 then the height of each tile in
 *  the final row will also be smaller.
 *
 * "Each tile is either encoded as raw pixel data, or as a variation on RRE.
 *  Each tile has a background pixel value, as before. The background pixel
 *  value does not need to be explicitly specified for a given tile if it is
 *  the same as the background of the previous tile. However the background
 *  pixel value may not be carried over if the previous tile was Raw. If all
 *  of the subrectangles of a tile have the same pixel value, this can be
 *  specified once as a foreground pixel value for the whole tile. As with
 *  the background, the foreground pixel value can be left unspecified,
 *  meaning it is carried over from the previous tile. The foreground pixel
 *  value may not be carried over if the previous tile had the Raw or
 *  SubrectsColoured bits set. It may, however, be carried over from a
