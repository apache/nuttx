 * Name: nxtask_create
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function creates and activates a new user task with a specified
 *   priority and returns its system-assigned ID.
 *
 *   The entry address entry is the address of the "main" function of the
 *   task.  This function will be called once the C environment has been
 *   set up.  The specified function will be called with four arguments.
 *   Should the specified routine return, a call to exit() will
 *   automatically be made.
 *
 *   Note that four (and only four) arguments must be passed for the spawned
 *   functions.
 *
 *   nxtask_create() is identical to the function task_create(), differing
 *   only in its return value:  This function does not modify the errno
 *   variable.  This is a non-standard, internal OS function and is not
 *   intended for use by application logic.  Applications should use
 *   task_create().
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   name       - Name of the new task
 *   priority   - Priority of the new task
 *   stack_size - size (in bytes) of the stack needed
 *   entry      - Entry point of a new task
 *   arg        - A pointer to an array of input parameters.  The array
 *                should be terminated with a NULL argv[] value. If no
 *                parameters are required, argv may be NULL.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Returns the positive, non-zero process ID of the new task or a negated
 *   errno value to indicate the nature of any failure.  If memory is
 *   insufficient or the task cannot be created -ENOMEM will be returned.
 *

 * Name: kthread_create
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function creates and activates a kernel thread task with
 *   kernel-mode privileges. It is identical to task_create() except
 *   that it configures the newly started thread to run in kernel model.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   name       - Name of the new task
 *   priority   - Priority of the new task
 *   stack_size - size (in bytes) of the stack needed
 *   entry      - Entry point of a new task
 *   arg        - A pointer to an array of input parameters.  The array
 *                should be terminated with a NULL argv[] value. If no
 *                parameters are required, argv may be NULL.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Returns the positive, non-zero process ID of the new task or a negated
 *   errno value to indicate the nature of any failure.  If memory is
 *   insufficient or the task cannot be created -ENOMEM will be returned.

 * Name: kthread_delete
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function will terminate a kernel thread.  At present, this
 *   function is equivalent to task_delete.c; the following definition
 *   simply reserves the name in the name space.
 *
 *   Refer to comments with task_delete() for a more detailed description of
 *   the operation of this function.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   pid - The task ID of the task to delete.  A pid of zero
 *         signifies the calling task.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK on success; or ERROR on failure with the errno variable set
 *   appropriately.
