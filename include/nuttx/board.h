/* This header file contains function prototypes for the interfaces between
 * (1) the nuttx core-code, (2) the microprocessor specific logic that
 * resides under the arch/ sub-directory, and (3) the board-specific logic
 * that resides under boards/
 *
 * Naming conventions:
 *
 * 1. Common Microprocessor Interfaces.
 *
 *    Any interface that is common across all microprocessors should be
 *    prefixed with up_ and prototyped in this header file. These
 *    definitions provide the common interface between NuttX and the
 *    architecture-specific implementation in arch/
 *
 *    These definitions are retained in the header file
 *    nuttx/include/arch.h
 *
 *    NOTE: up_ is supposed to stand for microprocessor; the u is like the
 *    Greek letter micron: µ. So it would be µP which is a common
 *    shortening of the word microprocessor.
 *
 * 2. Microprocessor-Specific Interfaces.
 *
 *    An interface which is unique to a certain microprocessor should be
 *    prefixed with the name of the microprocessor, for example stm32_,
 *    and be prototyped in some header file in the arch/ directories.
 *
 *    There is also a arch/<architecture>/include/<chip>/chip.h header file
 *    that can be used to communicate other microprocessor-specific
 *    information between the board logic and even application logic.
 *    Application logic may, for example, need to know specific capabilities
 *    of the chip.  Prototypes in that chip.h header file should follow the
 *    microprocessor specific naming convention.
 *
 * 3. Common Board Interfaces.
 *
 *    Any interface that is common across all boards should be prefixed
 *    with board_ and should be prototyped in this header file. These
 *    board_ definitions provide the interface between the board-level
 *    logic and the architecture-specific logic.
 *
 *    Board related declarations are retained in this header file.
 *
 *    There is also a boards/<arch>/<chip>/<board>/include/board.h header
 *    file that can be used to communicate other board-specific information
 *    between the architecture logic and even application logic.  Any
 *    definitions that are common between a single architecture and several
 *    boards should go in this board.h header file; this file is reserved
 *    for board-related definitions common to all architectures.
 *
 * 4. Board-Specific Interfaces.
 *
 *    Any interface that is unique to a board should be prefixed with
 *    the board name, for example stm32f4discovery_. Sometimes the board
 *    name is too long so stm32_ would be okay too. These should be
 *    prototyped in boards/<arch>/<chip>/<board>/src/<board>.h and should
 *    not be used outside of that board directory since board-specific
 *    definitions have no meaning outside of the board directory.

 *
 * Description:
 *   If CONFIG_BOARD_EARLY_INITIALIZE is selected, then an additional
 *   initialization call will be performed in the boot-up sequence to a
 *   function called board_early_initialize().  board_early_initialize()
 *   will be called immediately after up_initialize() and well before

 *   suitable for early initialization of most, simple device drivers and
 *   is a logical, board-specific extension of up_initialize().
 *
 *   board_early_initialize() runs on the startup, initialization thread.
 *   Some initialization operations cannot be performed on the start-up,
 *   initialization thread.  That is because the initialization thread
 *   cannot wait for event.  Waiting may be required, for example, to
 *   mount a file system or or initialize a device such as an SD card.
 *   For this reason, such driver initialize must be deferred to
 *   board_late_initialize().
