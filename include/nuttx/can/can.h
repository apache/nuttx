/* Configuration ********************************************************************/

/* CONFIG_CAN - Enables CAN support (MCU-specific selections are also required.  For
 *   STM32, as an example, one or both of CONFIG_STM32_CAN1 or CONFIG_STM32_CAN2
 *   must also be defined)
 * CONFIG_CAN_EXTID - Enables support for the 29-bit extended ID.  Default
 *   Standard 11-bit IDs.
 * CONFIG_CAN_FD - Enable support for CAN FD mode.  For the upper half driver, this
 *   just means handling encoded DLC values (for values of DLC > 9).
 * CONFIG_CAN_FIFOSIZE - The size of the circular buffer of CAN messages.
 *   Default: 8
 * CONFIG_CAN_NPENDINGRTR - The size of the list of pending RTR requests.
 *   Default: 4
 * CONFIG_CAN_LOOPBACK - A CAN driver may or may not support a loopback
 *   mode for testing. If the driver does support loopback mode, the setting
 *   will enable it. (If the driver does not, this setting will have no effect).
 *   The loopback mode may be changed later by ioctl() if the driver supports the
 *   CANIOC_SET_CONNMODES ioctl command.
 * CONFIG_CAN_TXREADY - Add support for the can_txready() callback.  This is needed
 *   only for CAN hardware the supports an separate H/W TX message FIFO.  The call
 *   back is needed to keep the S/W FIFO and the H/W FIFO in sync.  Work queue
 *   support is needed for this feature.
 * CONFIG_CAN_TXREADY_HIPRI or CONFIG_CAN_TXREADY_LOPRI - Selects which work queue
 *   will be used for the can_txready() processing.
 */

/* Ioctl Commands *******************************************************************/

/* Ioctl commands supported by the upper half CAN driver.
 *
 * CANIOC_RTR:
 *   Description:    Send the given message as a remote request. On successful
 *                   return, the passed message structure is updated with
 *                   the contents of the received message; i.e. the message
 *                   ID and the standard/extended ID indication bit stay the
 *                   same, but the DLC and data bits are updated with the
 *                   contents of the received message. If no response is
 *                   received after the specified timeout, ioctl will return.

/************************************************************************************
 * Name: can_txdone
 *
 * Description:
 *   Called when the hardware has processed the outgoing TX message.  This
 *   normally means that the CAN messages was sent out on the wire.  But
 *   if the CAN hardware supports a H/W TX FIFO, then this call may mean
 *   only that the CAN message has been added to the H/W FIFO.  In either
 *   case, the upper-half CAN driver can remove the outgoing message from
 *   the S/W FIFO and discard it.
 *
 *   This function may be called in different contexts, depending upon the
 *   nature of the underlying CAN hardware.
 *
 *   1. No H/W TX FIFO (CONFIG_CAN_TXREADY not defined)
 *
 *      This function is only called from the CAN interrupt handler at the
 *      completion of a send operation.
 *
 *        can_write() -> can_xmit() -> dev_send()
 *        CAN interrupt -> can_txdone()
 *
 *      If the CAN hardware is busy, then the call to dev_send() will
 *      fail, the S/W TX FIFO will accumulate outgoing messages, and the
 *      thread calling can_write() may eventually block waiting for space in
 *      the S/W TX FIFO.
 *
 *      When the CAN hardware completes the transfer and processes the
 *      CAN interrupt, the call to can_txdone() will make space in the S/W
 *      TX FIFO and will awaken the waiting can_write() thread.
 *
 *   2a. H/W TX FIFO (CONFIG_CAN_TXREADY=y) and S/W TX FIFO not full
 *
 *      This function will be called back from dev_send() immediately when a
 *      new CAN message is added to H/W TX FIFO:
 *
 *        can_write() -> can_xmit() -> dev_send() -> can_txdone()
 *
 *      When the H/W TX FIFO becomes full, dev_send() will fail and
 *      can_txdone() will not be called.  In this case the S/W TX FIFO will
 *      accumulate outgoing messages, and the thread calling can_write() may
 *      eventually block waiting for space in the S/W TX FIFO.
 *
 *   2b. H/W TX FIFO (CONFIG_CAN_TXREADY=y) and S/W TX FIFO full
 *
 *      In this case, the thread calling can_write() is blocked waiting for
 *      space in the S/W TX FIFO.  can_txdone() will be called, indirectly,
 *      from can_txready_work() running on the thread of the work queue.
 *
 *        CAN interrupt -> can_txready() -> Schedule can_txready_work()
 *        can_txready_work() -> can_xmit() -> dev_send() -> can_txdone()
 *
 *      The call dev_send() should not fail in this case and the subsequent
 *      call to can_txdone() will make space in the S/W TX FIFO and will
 *      awaken the waiting thread.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   dev  - The specific CAN device
 *   hdr  - The 16-bit CAN header
 *   data - An array contain the CAN data.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK on success; a negated errno on failure.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   Interrupts are disabled.  This is required by can_xmit() which is called
 *   by this function.  Interrupts are explicitly disabled when called
 *   through can_write().  Interrupts are expected be disabled when called
 *   from the CAN interrupt handler.
 *
 ************************************************************************************/

int can_txdone(FAR struct can_dev_s *dev);

/************************************************************************************
 * Name: can_txready
 *
 * Description:
 *   Called from the CAN interrupt handler at the completion of a send
 *   operation.  This interface is needed only for CAN hardware that
 *   supports queueing of outgoing messages in a H/W FIFO.
 *
 *   The CAN upper half driver also supports a queue of output messages in a
 *   S/W FIFO.  Messages are added to that queue when when can_write() is
 *   called and removed from the queue in can_txdone() when each TX message
 *   is complete.
 *
 *   After each message is added to the S/W FIFO, the CAN upper half driver
 *   will attempt to send the message by calling into the lower half driver.
 *   That send will not be performed if the lower half driver is busy, i.e.,
 *   if dev_txready() returns false.  In that case, the number of messages in
 *   the S/W FIFO can grow.  If the S/W FIFO becomes full, then can_write()
 *   will wait for space in the S/W FIFO.
 *
 *   If the CAN hardware does not support a H/W FIFO then busy means that
 *   the hardware is actively sending the message and is guaranteed to
 *   become non-busy (i.e, dev_txready()) when the send transfer completes
 *   and can_txdone() is called.  So the call to can_txdone() means that the
 *   transfer has completed and also that the hardware is ready to accept
 *   another transfer.
 *
 *   If the CAN hardware supports a H/W FIFO, can_txdone() is not called
 *   when the transfer is complete, but rather when the transfer is queued in
 *   the H/W FIFO.  When the H/W FIFO becomes full, then dev_txready() will
 *   report false and the number of queued messages in the S/W FIFO will grow.
 *
 *   There is no mechanism in this case to inform the upper half driver when
 *   the hardware is again available, when there is again space in the H/W
 *   FIFO.  can_txdone() will not be called again.  If the S/W FIFO becomes
 *   full, then the upper half driver will wait for space to become
 *   available, but there is no event to awaken it and the driver will hang.
 *
 *   Enabling this feature adds support for the can_txready() interface.
 *   This function is called from the lower half driver's CAN interrupt
 *   handler each time a TX transfer completes.  This is a sure indication
 *   that the H/W FIFO is no longer full.  can_txready() will then awaken
 *   the can_write() logic and the hang condition is avoided.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   dev  - The specific CAN device
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK on success; a negated errno on failure.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   Interrupts are disabled.  This function may execute in the context of
 *   and interrupt handler.
