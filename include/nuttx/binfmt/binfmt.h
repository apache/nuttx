int exec_module(FAR const struct binary_s *bin);

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: exec
 *
 * Description:
 *   This is a convenience function that wraps load_ and exec_module into
 *   one call.  If CONFIG_BINFMT_LOADABLE is defined, this function will
 *   schedule to unload the module when task exits.
 *
 *   This non-standard, NuttX function is similar to execv() and
 *   posix_spawn() but differs in the following ways;
 *
 *   - Unlike execv() and posix_spawn() this function accepts symbol table
 *     information as input parameters. This means that the symbol table
 *     used to link the application prior to execution is provided by the
 *     caller, not by the system.
 *   - Unlike execv(), this function always returns.
 *
 *   This non-standard interface is included as a official NuttX API only
 *   because it is needed in certain build modes: exec() is probably the
 *   only want to load programs in the PROTECTED mode. Other file execution
 *   APIs rely on a symbol table provided by the OS. In the PROTECTED build
 *   mode, the OS cannot provide any meaningful symbolic information for
 *   execution of code in the user-space blob so that is the exec() function
 *   is really needed in that build case
 *
 *   The interface is available in the FLAT build mode although it is not
 *   really necessary in that case. It is currently used by some example
 *   code under the apps/ that that generate their own symbol tables for
 *   linking test programs. So although it is not necessary, it can still
 *   be useful.
 *
 *   The interface would be completely useless and will not be supported in
 *   in the KERNEL build mode where the contrary is true: An application
 *   process cannot provide any meaning symbolic information for use in
 *   linking a different process.
 *
 *   NOTE: This function is flawed and useless without CONFIG_BINFMT_LOADABLE
 *   because without that features there is then no mechanism to unload the
 *   module once it exits.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   filename - The path to the program to be executed. If
 *              CONFIG_LIB_ENVPATH is defined in the configuration, then
 *              this may be a relative path from the current working
 *              directory. Otherwise, path must be the absolute path to the
 *              program.
 *   argv     - A pointer to an array of string arguments. The end of the
 *              array is indicated with a NULL entry.
 *   exports  - The address of the start of the caller-provided symbol
 *              table. This symbol table contains the addresses of symbols
 *              exported by the caller and made available for linking the
 *              module into the system.
 *   nexports - The number of symbols in the exports table.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   It returns the PID of the exec'ed module.  On failure, it returns
 *   the negative errno value appropriately.

 * Name: exec_spawn
 *
 * Description:

 * Input Parameters:
