/* Most internal nxsem_* interfaces are not available in the user space in

 *
 * This is only important when compiling libraries (libc or libnx) that are

 * Description:
 *   This function initializes the UNNAMED semaphore sem. Following a

 * Input Parameters:
 *   sem - Semaphore to be initialized

 *   value - Semaphore initialization value
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This is an internal OS interface and should not be used by applications.

 * Name: nxsem_set_protocol

 * Description:

 *
 *    One particularly important use of this function is when a semaphore

 *
 *      TASK A                 TASK B

 *      Awakens as holder
 *
 *    In this case priority inheritance can interfere with the operation of
 *    the semaphore.  The problem is that when TASK A is restarted it is a
 *    holder of the semaphore.  However, it never calls sem_post(sem) so it
 *    becomes *permanently* a holder of the semaphore and may have its
 *    priority boosted when any other task tries to acquire the semaphore.
 *
 *    The fix is to call nxsem_set_protocol(SEM_PRIO_NONE) immediately after
 *    the sem_init() call so that there will be no priority inheritance
 *    operations on this semaphore.
