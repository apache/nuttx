/* P14201 Configuration Settings:
 *
 * CONFIG_P14201_SPIMODE - Controls the SPI mode
 * CONFIG_P14201_FREQUENCY - Define to use a different bus frequency
 * CONFIG_P14201_NINTERFACES - Specifies the number of physical P14201 devices
 *   that will be supported.
 * CONFIG_P14201_FRAMEBUFFER - If defined, accesses will be performed using
 *   an in-memory copy of the OLEDs GDDRAM.  This cost of this buffer is
 *   128 * 96 / 2 = 6Kb.  If this is defined, then the driver will be fully
 *   functional. If not, then it will have the following limitations:
 *
 *   - Reading graphics memory cannot be supported, and
 *   - All pixel writes must be aligned to byte boundaries.
 *
 *   The latter limitation effectively reduces the 128x96 display to 64x96.
 *
 * Required LCD driver settings:
 * CONFIG_LCD_P14201 - Enable P14201 support
 * CONFIG_LCD_MAXCONTRAST should be 255, but any value >0 and <=255 will be
 *   accepted.
 * CONFIG_LCD_MAXPOWER must be 1
 *
 * Required SPI driver settings:
 * CONFIG_SPI_CMDDATA - Include support for cmd/data selection.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name:  rit_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   Initialize the P14201 video hardware.  The initial state of the OLED is
 *   fully initialized, display memory cleared, and the OLED ready to use,
 *   but with the powersetting at 0 (full off == sleep mode).
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *
 *   spi - A reference to the SPI driver instance.
 *   devno - A value in the range of 0 through CONFIG_P14201_NINTERFACES-1.
 *     This allows support for multiple OLED devices.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *
 *   On success, this function returns a reference to the LCD object for the
 *   specified OLED.  NULL is returned on any failure.
