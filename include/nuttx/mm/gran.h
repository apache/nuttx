/****************************************************************************
 * Name: gran_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   Set up one granule allocator instance.  Allocations will be aligned to
 *   the alignment size (log2align; allocations will be in units of the
 *   granule size (log2gran). Larger granules will give better performance
 *   and less overhead but more losses of memory due to quantization waste.
 *   Additional memory waste can occur from alignment; log2align should be
 *   set to 0 unless you are using the granule allocator to manage DMA
 *   or page-aligned memory and your hardware has specific memory alignment
 *   requirements.
 *
 *   General Usage Summary.  This is an example using the GCC section
 *   attribute to position a DMA heap in memory (logic in the linker script
 *   would assign the section .dmaheap to the DMA memory.
 *
 *   FAR uint32_t g_dmaheap[DMAHEAP_SIZE] locate_data(.dmaheap);
 *
 *   The heap is created by calling gran_initialize.  Here the granule size
 *   is set to 64 bytes and the alignment to 16 bytes:
 *
 *     GRAN_HANDLE handle = gran_initialize(g_dmaheap, DMAHEAP_SIZE, 6, 4);
 *
 *   Then the GRAN_HANDLE can be used to allocate memory:
 *
 *     FAR uint8_t *dma_memory = (FAR uint8_t *)gran_alloc(handle, 47);
 *
 *   The actual memory allocates will be 64 byte (wasting 17 bytes) and
 *   will be aligned at least to (1 << log2align).
 *
 *   NOTE: The current implementation also restricts the maximum allocation
 *   size to 32 granules.  That restriction could be eliminated with some
 *   additional coding effort.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   heapstart - Start of the granule allocation heap
 *   heapsize  - Size of heap in bytes
 *   log2gran  - Log base 2 of the size of one granule.  0->1 byte,
 *               1->2 bytes, 2->4 bytes, 3->8 bytes, etc.
 *   log2align - Log base 2 of required alignment.  0->1 byte,
 *               1->2 bytes, 2->4 bytes, 3->8 bytes, etc.  Note that
 *               log2gran must be greater than or equal to log2align
 *               so that all contiguous granules in memory will meet
 *               the minimum alignment requirement. A value of zero
 *               would mean that no alignment is required.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, a non-NULL handle is returned that may be used with other
 *   granule allocator interfaces.
