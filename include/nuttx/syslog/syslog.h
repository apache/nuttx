/* Configuration ************************************************************/

/* CONFIG_SYSLOG_INTBUFFER - Enables an interrupt buffer that will be used
 *   to serialize debug output from interrupt handlers.
 * CONFIG_SYSLOG_INTBUFSIZE - The size of the interrupt buffer in bytes.
 * CONFIG_SYSLOG_DEVPATH - The full path to the system logging device
 *
 * In addition, some SYSLOG device must also be enabled that will provide
 * the syslog output channel.  As of this writing, there are two SYSLOG
 * devices available:
 *
 *   1. A RAM SYSLOGing device that will log data into a circular buffer
 *      that can be dumped using the NSH dmesg command.  This device is
 *      described in the include/nuttx/syslog/ramlog.h header file.
 *
 *   2. And a generic character device that may be used as the SYSLOG.  The
 *      generic device interfaces are described in this file.  A disadvantage
 *      of using the generic character device for the SYSLOG is that it
 *      cannot handle debug output generated from interrupt level handlers.
 *
 * CONFIG_SYSLOG_CHAR - Enable the generic character device for the SYSLOG.
 *   The full path to the SYSLOG device is provided by CONFIG_SYSLOG_DEVPATH.
 *   A valid character device must exist at this path.  It will by opened
 *   by logic in syslog_initialize() based on the current configuration.
 *
 *   NOTE:  No more than one SYSLOG device should be configured.

 * Name: syslog_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   One power up, the SYSLOG facility is non-existent or limited to very
 *   low-level output.  This function is called later in the initialization
 *   sequence after full driver support has been initialized.  It installs
 *   the configured SYSLOG drivers and enables full SYSLOGing capability.
 *
 *   This function performs these basic operations:
 *
 *   - Initialize the SYSLOG device
 *   - Call syslog_channel() to begin using that device.
 *
 *   If CONFIG_ARCH_SYSLOG is selected, then the architecture-specifica
 *   logic will provide its own SYSLOG device initialize which must include
 *   as a minimum a call to syslog_channel() to use the device.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success; a negated errno value is returned on
 *   any failure.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: syslog_file_channel
 *
 * Description:
 *   Configure to use a file in a mounted file system at 'devpath' as the
 *   SYSLOG channel.
 *
 *   This tiny function is simply a wrapper around syslog_dev_initialize()
 *   and syslog_channel().  It calls syslog_dev_initialize() to configure
 *   the character file at 'devpath then calls syslog_channel() to use that
 *   device as the SYSLOG output channel.
 *
 *   File SYSLOG channels differ from other SYSLOG channels in that they
 *   cannot be established until after fully booting and mounting the target
 *   file system.  This function would need to be called from board-specific
 *   bring-up logic AFTER mounting the file system containing 'devpath'.
 *
 *   SYSLOG data generated prior to calling syslog_file_channel will, of
 *   course, not be included in the file.
 *
 *   NOTE interrupt level SYSLOG output will be lost in this case unless
 *   the interrupt buffer is used.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   devpath - The full path to the file to be used for SYSLOG output.
 *     This may be an existing file or not.  If the file exists,
 *     syslog_file_channel() will append new SYSLOG data to the end of the
 *     file.  If it does not, then syslog_file_channel() will create the
 *     file.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success; a negated errno value is returned on
 *   any failure.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: syslog_flush
 *
 * Description:
 *   This is called by system crash-handling logic.  It must flush any
 *   buffered data to the SYSLOG device.
 *
 *   Interrupts are disabled at the time of the crash and this logic must
 *   perform the flush using low-level, non-interrupt driven logic.
 *
 *   REVISIT:  There is an implementation problem in that if a character
 *   driver is the underlying device, then there is no mechanism to flush
 *   the data buffered in the driver with interrupts disabled.
 *
 *   Currently, this function on (a) dumps the interrupt buffer (if the
 *   SYSLOG interrupt buffer is enabled), and (b) only the SYSLOG interface
 *   supports supports the 'sc_force()' method.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK)is returned on  success.  A negated errno value is returned
 *   on any failure.

 *   filtering has already been performed and the va_list parameter is
