/****************************************************************************
 * Name: pg_miss
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is called from architecture-specific memory segmentation
 *   fault handling logic.  This function will perform the following
 *   operations:
 *
 *   1) Sanity checking.
 *      - ASSERT if the currently executing task is the page fill worker
 *        thread.  The page fill worker thread is how the page fault
 *        is resolved and all logic associated with the page fill worker
 *        must be "locked" and always present in memory.
 *   2) Block the currently executing task.
 *      - Call up_block_task() to block the task at the head of the ready-
 *        to-run list.  This should cause an interrupt level context switch
 *        to the next highest priority task.
 *      - The blocked task will be marked with state TSTATE_WAIT_PAGEFILL
 *        and will be retained in the g_waitingforfill prioritized task
 *        list.
 *   3) Boost the page fill worker thread priority.
 *      - Check the priority of the task at the head of the g_waitingforfill
 *        list.  If the priority of that task is higher than the current
 *        priority of the page fill worker thread, then boost the priority
 *        of the page fill worker thread to that priority.
 *   4) Signal the page fill worker thread.
 *      - Is there a page fill pending?  If not then signal the worker
 *        thread to start working on the queued page fill requests.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None - The head of the ready-to-run list is assumed to be task that
 *   caused the exception.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None - Either this function function succeeds or an assertion occurs.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   - It is assumed that this function is called from the level of an
 *     exception handler and that all interrupts are disabled.
 *   - It is assumed that currently executing task (the one at the head of
 *     the ready-to-run list) is the one that cause the fault.  This will
 *     always be true unless the page fault occurred in an interrupt handler.
 *     Interrupt handling logic must always be present and "locked" into
 *     memory.
 *   - The chip-specific page fault exception handler has already verified
 *     that the exception did not occur from interrupt/exception handling
 *     logic.
 *   - As mentioned above, the task causing the page fault must not be the
 *     page fill worker thread because that is the only way to complete the
 *     page fill.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *   1. One way to accomplish this would be a two pass link phase:
 *      - In the first phase, create a partially linked objected containing
 *        all interrupt/exception handling logic, the page fill worker thread
 *        plus all parts of the IDLE thread (which must always be available
 *        for execution).
 *      - All of the .text and .rodata sections of this partial link should
 *        be collected into a single section.
 *      - The second link would link the partially linked object along with
 *        the remaining object to produce the final binary.  The linker
 *        script should position the "special" section so that it lies
 *        in a reserved, "non-swappable" region.

 * Name: up_checkmapping()
 *
 * Description:
 *  The function up_checkmapping() returns an indication if the page fill
 *  still needs to performed or not. In certain conditions, the page fault
 *  may occur on several threads and be queued multiple times. This function
 *  will prevent the same page from be filled multiple times.
 *
 * Input Parameters:

 *         needs to have a page fill.  Architecture-specific logic can
 *         retrieve page fault information from the architecture-specific
 *         context information in this TCB and can consult processor
 *         resources (page tables or TLBs or ???) to determine if the fill
 *         still needs to be performed or not.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This function will return true if the mapping is in place and false
 *   if the mapping is still needed.  Errors encountered should be
 *   interpreted as fatal.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   - This function is called from the normal tasking context (but with

 * Name: up_allocpage()
 *
 * Description:
 *  This architecture-specific function will set aside page in memory and map
 *  the page to its correct virtual address.  Architecture-specific context
 *  information saved within the TCB will provide the function with the
 *  information needed to identify the virtual miss address.
 *
 *  This function will return the allocated physical page address in vpage.
 *  The size of the underlying physical page is determined by the
 *  configuration setting CONFIG_PAGING_PAGESIZE.
 *
 *  NOTE 1: This function must always return a page allocation. If all
 *  available pages are in-use (the typical case), then this function will
 *  select a page in-use, un-map it, and make it available.
 *
 *  NOTE 2: If an in-use page is un-mapped, it may be necessary to flush the
 *  instruction cache in some architectures.
 *
 *  NOTE 3: Allocating and filling a page is a two step process.
 *  up_allocpage() allocates the page, and up_fillpage() fills it with data
 *  from some non- volatile storage device.  This distinction is made because
 *  up_allocpage() can probably be implemented in board-independent logic
 *  whereas up_fillpage() probably must be implemented as board-specific
 *  logic.
 *
 *  NOTE 4: The initial mapping of vpage should be read-able and write-
 *  able (but not cached).  No special actions will be required of
 *  up_fillpage() in order to write into this allocated page.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   tcb - A reference to the task control block of the task that needs to
 *         have a page fill.  Architecture-specific logic can retrieve page
 *         fault information from the architecture-specific context
 *         information in this TCB to perform the mapping.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This function will return zero (OK) if the allocation was successful.
 *   A negated errno value may be returned if an error occurs.  All errors,
 *   however, are fatal.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   - This function is called from the normal tasking context (but with
 *     interrupts disabled).  The implementation must take whatever actions
 *     are necessary to assure that the operation is safe within this

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: up_fillpage()
 *
 * Description:
 *  After a page is allocated and mapped by up_allocpage(), the actual
 *  filling of the page with data from the non-volatile, must be performed
 *  by a separate call to the architecture-specific function, up_fillpage().
 *  This function is non-blocking, it will start an asynchronous page fill.
 *  The common paging logic will provide a callback function, pg_callback,
 *  that will be called when the page fill is finished (or an error occurs).
 *  This callback is assumed to occur from an interrupt level when the
 *  device driver completes the fill operation.
 *
 *  NOTE 1: Allocating and filling a page is a two step process.
 *  up_allocpage() allocates the page, and up_fillpage() fills it with data
 *  from some non- volatile storage device. This distinction is made because
 *  up_allocpage() can probably be implemented in board-independent logic
 *  whereas up_fillpage() probably must be implemented as board-specific
 *  logic.
 *
 *  NOTE 2: The initial mapping of vpage will be read-able, write-able,
 *  but non-cacheable.  No special actions will be required of
 *  up_fillpage() in order to write into this allocated page.  If the
 *  virtual address maps to a text region, however, this function should
 *  remap the region so that is is read/execute only.  It should be made
 *  cache-able in any case.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   tcb - A reference to the task control block of the task that needs to
 *         have a page fill.  Architecture-specific logic can retrieve page
 *         fault information from the architecture-specific context
 *         information in this TCB to perform the fill.
 *   pg_callbck - The function to be called when the page fill is complete.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   This function will return zero (OK) if the page fill was successfully
 *   started (the result of the page fill is passed to the callback function
 *   as the result argument).  A negated errno value may be returned if an
 *   error occurs.  All errors, however, are fatal.
 *
 *   NOTE: -EBUSY has a special meaning. It is used internally to mean that
 *   the callback function has not executed.  Therefore, -EBUSY should
 *   never be provided in the result argument of pg_callback.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   - This function is called from the normal tasking context (but
 *     interrupts siabled).  The implementation must take whatever actions
 *     are necessary to assure that the operation is safe within this
 *     context.
 *   - Upon return, the caller will sleep waiting for the page fill callback
 *     to occur.  The callback function will perform the wakeup.
