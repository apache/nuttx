 *   You can register the character device type by specific path and esize.
 *   This API corresponds to the sensor_custom_unregister.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   dev   - A pointer to an instance of lower half sensor driver. This
 *           instance is bound to the sensor driver and must persist as long
 *           as the driver persists.
 *   path  - The user specifies path of device. ex: /dev/uorb/xxx.
 *   esize - The element size of intermediate circular buffer.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK if the driver was successfully register; A negated errno value is
 *   returned on any failure.
