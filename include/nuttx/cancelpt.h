 * Cancellation Points.
 *
 * Cancellation points shall occur when a thread is executing the following
 * functions:
 *
 * accept()          mq_timedsend()           putpmsg()       sigtimedwait()
 * aio_suspend()     msgrcv()                 pwrite()        sigwait()
 * clock_nanosleep() msgsnd()                 read()          sigwaitinfo()
 * close()           msync()                  readv()         sleep()
 * connect()         nanosleep()              recv()          system()
 * creat()           open()                   recvfrom()      tcdrain()
 * fcntl()           pause()                  recvmsg()       usleep()
 * fdatasync()       poll()                   select()        wait()
 * fsync()           pread()                  sem_timedwait() waitid()
 * getmsg()          pselect()                sem_wait()      waitpid()
 * getpmsg()         pthread_cond_timedwait() send()          write()
 * lockf()           pthread_cond_wait()      sendmsg()       writev()
 * mq_receive()      pthread_join()           sendto()
 * mq_send()         pthread_testcancel()     sigpause()
 * mq_timedreceive() putmsg()                 sigsuspend()
 *
 * Each of the above function must call enter_cancellation_point() on entry
 * in order to establish the cancellation point and leave_cancellation_point()
 * on exit.  These functions are described below.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: enter_cancellation_point
 *
 * Description:
 *   Called at the beginning of the cancellation point to establish the
 *   cancellation point.  This function does the following:
 *
 *   1. If deferred cancellation does not apply to this thread, nothing is
 *      done, otherwise, it
 *   2. Sets state information in the caller's TCB and increments a nesting
 *      count.
 *   3. If this is the outermost nesting level, it checks if there is a
 *      pending cancellation and, if so, calls either exit() or
 *      pthread_exit(), depending upon the type of the thread.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value
 *   true is returned if a cancellation is pending but cannot be performed
 *   now due to the nesting level.

 * Name: leave_cancellation_point
 *
 * Description:
 *   Called at the end of the cancellation point.  This function does the
 *   following:
 *
 *   1. If deferred cancellation does not apply to this thread, nothing is
 *      done, otherwise, it
 *   2. Clears state information in the caller's TCB and decrements a
 *      nesting count.
 *   3. If this is the outermost nesting level, it checks if there is a
 *      pending cancellation and, if so, calls either exit() or

 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
