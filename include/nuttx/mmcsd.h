 *     registered as /dev/mmcsdN where N is the minor number
 *   dev - And instance of an MMC/SD interface.  The MMC/SD hardware should
 *     be initialized and ready to use.

 * Input Parameters:
 *   minor - The MMC/SD minor device number.  The MMC/SD device will be
 *     registered as /dev/mmcsdN where N is the minor number
 *   slotno - The slot number to use.  This is only meaningful for architectures
 *     that support multiple MMC/SD slots.  This value must be in the range
 *     {0, ..., CONFIG_MMCSD_NSLOTS}.
 *   spi - And instance of an SPI interface obtained by called the
 *     appropriate xyz_spibus_initialize() function for the MCU "xyz" with
 *     the appropriate port number.
