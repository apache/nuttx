/* Configuration ************************************************************/

/* CONFIG_HID_STATEDEPTH
 *   Constant indicating the maximum stack depth of the state table. A larger
 *   state table allows for more PUSH/POP report items to be nested, but
 *   consumes more memory. By default this is set to 2 levels (allowing non-
 *   nested PUSH items) but this can be overridden by defining
 *   CONFIG_HID_STATEDEPTH in the NuttX config file.
 *
 * CONFIG_HID_USAGEDEPTH
 *   Constant indicating the maximum stack depth of the usage table. A larger
 *   usage table allows for more USAGE items to be indicated sequentially for
 *   REPORT COUNT entries of more than one, but requires more stack space. By
 *   default this is set to 8 levels (allowing for a report item with a count
 *   of 8) but this can be overridden by defining CONFIG_HID_USAGEDEPTH to
 *   in the NuttX config file.
 *
 * CONFIG_HID_MAXCOLLECTIONS
 *   Constant indicating the maximum number of COLLECTION items (nested or
 *   unnested) that can be processed in the report item descriptor. A large
 *   value allows for more COLLECTION items to be processed, but consumes
 *   more memory. By default this is set to 10 collections, but this can be
 *   overridden by defining CONFIG_HID_MAXCOLLECTIONS in the NuttX config
 *   file.
 *
 * CONFIG_HID_MAXITEMS
 *   Constant indicating the maximum number of report items (IN, OUT or
 *   FEATURE) that can be processed in the report item descriptor and stored
 *   in the user HID Report Info structure. A large value allows
 *   for more report items to be stored, but consumes more memory. By default
 *   this is set to 20 items, but this can be overridden by defining
 *   CONFIG_HID_MAXITEMS in the NuttX config file.
 *
 * CONFIG_HID_MAXIDS
 *   Constant indicating the maximum number of unique report IDs that can be
 *   processed in the report item descriptor for the report size information
 *   array in the user HID Report Info structure. A large value allows for
 *   more report ID report sizes to be stored, but consumes more memory. By
 *   default this is set to 10 items, but this can be overridden by defining
 *   CONFIG_HID_MAXIDS in the NuttX config file. Note that IN, OUT and
 *   FEATURE items sharing the same report ID consume only one size item in
 *   the array.
