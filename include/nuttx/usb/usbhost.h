/************************************************************************************
 * Name: CLASS_CREATE
 *
 * Description:
 *   This macro will call the create() method of struct usbhost_registry_s.
 *   The create() method is a callback into the class implementation.  It is used
 *   to (1) create a new instance of the USB host class state and to (2) bind a
 *   USB host driver "session" to the class instance.  Use of this create() method
 *   will support environments where there may be multiple USB ports and multiple
 *   USB devices simultaneously connected.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   reg - The USB host class registry entry previously obtained from a call to
 *     usbhost_findclass().
 *   hport - The hub hat manages the new class instance.
 *   id - In the case where the device supports multiple base classes, subclasses, or
 *     protocols, this specifies which to configure for.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, this function will return a non-NULL instance of struct
 *   usbhost_class_s that can be used by the USB host driver to communicate with the
 *   USB host class.  NULL is returned on failure; this function will fail only if
 *   the drvr input parameter is NULL or if there are insufficient resources to
 *   create another USB host class instance.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   If this function is called from an interrupt handler, it will be unable to
 *   allocate memory and CONFIG_USBHOST_NPREALLOC should be defined to be a value
 *   greater than zero specify a number of pre-allocated class structures.

 * Name: CLASS_CONNECT
 *
 * Description:
 *   This macro will call the connect() method of struct usbhost_class_s.  This
 *   method is a callback into the devclass implementation.  It is used to provide
 *   the device's configuration descriptor to the devclass so that the devclass may
 *   initialize properly.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   devclass   - The USB host class entry previously obtained from a call
 *                to create().
 *   configdesc - A pointer to a uint8_t buffer containing the configuration
 *                descriptor.
 *   desclen    - The length in bytes of the configuration descriptor.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, zero (OK) is returned. On a failure, a negated errno value is
 *   returned indicating the nature of the failure
 *
 *   NOTE that the class instance remains valid upon return with a failure.  It is
 *   the responsibility of the higher level enumeration logic to call
 *   CLASS_DISCONNECTED to free up the class driver resources.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   - This function is probably called on the same thread that called the driver
 *     enumerate() method. This function will *not* be called from an interrupt
 *     handler.
 *   - If this function returns an error, the USB host controller driver
