/* The maximum delay tick are supposed to be CLOCK_MAX >> 1.
 * However, if there are expired wdog timers in the wdog queue,
 * clock_compare might be incorrect when the delay is CLOCK_MAX >> 1.
 * e.g. Current tick is 123, and there is an expired wdog timer with the
 * expired ticks 100. If we insert a wdog timer with delay CLOCK_MAX >> 1,
 * Then clock_compare(100, 123 + CLOCK_MAX >> 1) will return false, leading
 * to the new wdog timer queued before the expired wdog timer.
 * So we limited the delay to CLOCK_MAX >> 2, which is 2^30 - 1 or 2^62 - 1.
 * Assuming all expired wdog timer can be processed within WDOG_MAX_DELAY
 * ticks, this ensure the correct enqueue of the wdog timer.

 * Description:
 *   This function adds a watchdog timer to the active timer queue.  The

 *   Watchdog timers may be started from the interrupt level.
 *
 *   Watchdog timers execute in the address environment that was in effect
 *   when wd_start() is called.
 *
 *   Watchdog timers execute only once.
 *
 *   To replace either the timeout delay or the function to be executed,
 *   call wd_start again with the same wdog; only the most recent wdStart()
 *   on a given watchdog ID has any effect.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   wdog     - Watchdog ID
 *   delay    - Delay count in clock ticks
 *   wdentry  - Function to call on timeout
 *   arg      - Parameter to pass to wdentry.
 *
 *   NOTE:  The parameter must be of type wdparm_t.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) is returned on success; a negated errno value is return to
