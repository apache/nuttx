 * Name: bluetooth_input
 *
 * Description:
 *   Handle incoming Bluetooth input
 *
 *   This function is called when the radio device driver has received an
 *   frame from the network.  The frame from the device driver must be
 *   provided in by the IOB frame argument of the  function call:
 *
 *   - The frame data is in the IOB io_data[] buffer,
 *   - The length of the frame is in the IOB io_len field, and
 *   - The offset past and radio MAC header is provided in the io_offset
 *     field.
 *
 *   The frame argument may refer to a single frame (a list of length one)
 *   or may it be the head of a list of multiple frames.
 *
 *   - The io_flink field points to the next frame in the list (if enable)
 *   - The last frame in the list will have io_flink == NULL.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   radio       The radio network driver interface.
 *   framelist - The head of an incoming list of frames.  Normally this
 *               would be a single frame.  A list may be provided if
 *               appropriate, however.
 *   meta      - Meta data characterizing the received frame.
 *
 *               If there are multiple frames in the list, this metadata
 *               must apply to all of the frames in the list.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK    The Bluetooth has been processed  and can be deleted
 *   ERROR Hold the Bluetooth and try again later. There is a listening
 *         socket but no recv in place to catch the Bluetooth yet.
 *         Useful when a packet arrives before a recv call is in place.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   Called from the network diver with the network locked.
