 * to query the multicast listening state of neighboring interfaces

 * There are three variants of the Query message:
 *
 * 1. A "General Query" is sent by the Querier to learn which multicast
 *    addresses have listeners on an attached link.  In a General Query,
 *    both the Multicast Address field and the Number of Sources (N)

 * 2. A "Multicast Address Specific Query" is sent by the Querier to

 *    attached link.  In a Multicast Address Specific Query, the
 *    Multicast Address field contains the multicast address of
 *    interest, while the Number of Sources (N) field is set to zero.
 * 3. "Multicast Address and Source Specific Query" is sent by the
 *    Querier to learn if any of the sources from the specified list for
 *    the particular multicast address has any listeners on an attached
 *    link or not.  In a Multicast Address and Source Specific Query the
