/* The device structure for radio network device differs from the standard
 * Ethernet MAC device structure.  The main reason for this difference is
 * that fragmentation must be supported.
 *
 * The radio network driver does not use the d_buf packet buffer directly.
 * Rather, it uses a list smaller frame buffers.
 *
 *   - Outgoing frame data is provided in an IOB in the via the
 *     r_req_data() interface method each time that the radio needs to
 *     send more data.  The length of the frame is provided in the io_len
 *     field of the IOB.
 *
 *     Outgoing frames are generated when the radio network driver calls
 *     the devif_poll(), devif_timer(), sixlowpan_input(), or
 *     ieee802154_input() interfaces.  In each case, the radio driver must
 *     provide a working buffer in the d_buf pointer.  A special form of
 *     the packet buffer must be used, struct sixlowpan_reassbuf_s.  This
 *     special for includes appended data for managing reassembly of packets.
 *
 *   - Received frames are provided by radio network driver to the network
 *     via an IOB parameter in the sixlowpan_input() pr ieee802154_input()
 *     interface.  The length of the frame is io_len.
 *
 *     Again, the radio network driver must provide an instance of struct
 *     sixlowpan_reassbuf_s as the packet buffer in the d_buf field.  This
 *     driver-provided data will only be used if the the receive frames are
 *     not fragmented.
 *
 *   - Received 6LoWPAN frames and will be uncompressed and possibly
 *     reassembled in resassembled the d_buf;  d_len will hold the size of
 *     the reassembled packet.
 *
 *     For fagemented frames, d_buf provided by radio driver will not be
 *     used.  6LoWPAN must handle multiple reassemblies from different
 *     sources simultaneously.  To support this, 6LoWPAN will allocate a
 *     unique reassembly buffer for each active reassembly, based on the
 *     reassembly tag and source radio address.  These reassembly buffers
 *     are managed entirely by the 6LoWPAN layer.
 *
 * This is accomplished by "inheriting" the standard 'struct net_driver_s'
 * and appending the frame buffer as well as other metadata needed to
 * manage the fragmentation.  'struct radio_driver_s' is cast
 * compatible with 'struct net_driver_s' when dev->d_lltype ==
 * NET_LL_IEEE802154 or dev->d_lltype == NET_LL_PKTRADIO.
 *
 * The radio network driver has responsibility for initializing this
 * structure.  In general, all fields must be set to NULL.  In addition:
 *
 * 1. On a TX poll, the radio network driver should provide its driver
 *    structure along is (single) reassemby buffer provided at d_buf.
 *    During the course of the poll, the networking layer may generate
 *    outgoing frames.  These frames will by provided to the radio network
 *    driver via the req_data() method.
 *
 *    After sending each frame through the radio, the MAC driver must
 *    return the frame to the pool of free IOBs using the iob_free().
 *
 * 2. When receiving data both buffers must be provided for 6LoWPAN
 *    frames;  PF_IEEE802154 frames do not require the d_buf.
 *
 *    The radio driver should receive the frame data directly into the
 *    payload area of an IOB frame structure.  That IOB structure may be
 *    obtained using the iob_alloc() function.
 *
 *    For 6LoWPAN, fragmented packets will be reassembled using allocated
 *    reassembly buffers that are managed by the 6LoWPAN layer.  The radio
 *    driver must still provide its (single) reassembly buffer in d_buf;
 *    that buffer is still used for the case where the packet is not
 *    fragmented into many frames.  In either case, the packet buffer will
 *    have a size of advertised MTU of the protocol,
 *    CONFIG_NET_6LOWPAN_PKTSIZE, plus CONFIG_NET_GUARDSIZE and some
 *    additional overhead for reassembly state data.
 *
 *    The radio network driver should then inform the network of the recipt
 *    of a frame by calling sixlowpan_input() or ieee802154_input().  That
 *    single frame (or, perhaps, list of frames) should be provided as
 *    second argument of that call.
 *
 *    The network will free the IOB by calling iob_free after it has
 *    processed the incoming frame.  As a complexity, the result of
 *    receiving a frame may be that the network may respond provide an
 *    outgoing frames in the via a nested call to the req_data() method.
