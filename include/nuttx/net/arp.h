 * Name: arp_ipin
 *
 * Description:
 *   The arp_ipin() function should be called by Ethernet device drivers
 *   whenever an IP packet arrives from the network.  The function will
 *   check if the address is in the ARP cache, and if so the ARP cache entry
 *   will be refreshed.
 *   If no ARP cache entry was found, a new one is created.
 *
 *   This function expects that an IP packet with an Ethernet header is
 *   present in the d_buf buffer and that the length of the packet is in the
 *   d_len field.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: arp_arpin
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function should be called by the Ethernet device driver when an ARP
 *   packet has been received.   The function will act differently
 *   depending on the ARP packet type: if it is a reply for a request
 *   that we previously sent out, the ARP cache will be filled in with
 *   the values from the ARP reply.  If the incoming ARP packet is an ARP
 *   request for our IP address, an ARP reply packet is created and put
 *   into the d_buf buffer.
 *
 *   On entry, this function expects that an ARP packet with a prepended
 *   Ethernet header is present in the d_buf buffer and that the length of
 *   the packet is set in the d_len field.
 *
 *   When the function returns, the value of the field d_len indicates
 *   whether the device driver should send out the ARP reply packet or not.
 *   If d_len is zero, no packet should be sent; If d_len is non-zero, it
 *   contains the length of the outbound packet that is present in the d_buf
 *   buffer.
 *

void arp_arpin(FAR struct net_driver_s *dev);

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: arp_out
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function should be called before sending out an IPv4 packet. The
 *   function checks the destination IPv4 address of the IPv4 packet to see
 *   what Ethernet MAC address that should be used as a destination MAC
 *   address on the Ethernet.
 *
 *   If the destination IPv4 address is in the local network (determined
 *   by logical ANDing of netmask and our IPv4 address), the function
 *   checks the ARP cache to see if an entry for the destination IPv4
 *   address is found.  If so, an Ethernet header is pre-pended at the
 *   beginning of the packet and the function returns.
 *
 *   If no ARP cache entry is found for the destination IIPv4P address, the
 *   packet in the d_buf is replaced by an ARP request packet for the
 *   IPv4 address. The IPv4 packet is dropped and it is assumed that the
 *   higher level protocols (e.g., TCP) eventually will retransmit the
 *   dropped packet.
 *
 *   Upon return in either the case, a packet to be sent is present in the
 *   d_buf buffer and the d_len field holds the length of the Ethernet
 *   frame that should be transmitted.
