/* This header file provides definition for a standard discrete joystick
 * interface.  A discrete joystick refers to a joystick that could be
 * implemented entirely with GPIO input pins.  So up, down, left, and right
 * are all discrete values like buttons (as opposed to integer values like
 * you might obtain from an analog joystick).
 *
 * The discrete joystick driver exports a standard character driver
 * interface. By convention, the discrete joystick is registered as an input
 * device at /dev/djoyN where N uniquely identifies the driver instance.
 *
 * This header file documents the generic interface that all NuttX discrete
 * joystick devices must conform.  It adds standards and conventions on top
 * of the standard character driver interface.

/* IOCTL commands
 *
 * Discrete joystick drivers do not support the character driver write() or
 * seek() methods.  The remaining driver methods behave as follows:
 *
 * 1) The read() method will always return a single value of size
 *    djoy_buttonset_t that represents the current state of the joystick
 *    buttons.  read() never blocks.
 * 2) The poll() method can be used to notify a client if there is a change
 *    in any of the joystick discrete inputs.  This feature, of course,
 *    depends upon interrupt GPIO support from the platform.  NOTE: that
 *    semantics of poll() for POLLIN are atypical:  The successful poll
 *    means that the data has changed and has nothing to with the
 *    availability of data to be read; data is always available to be
 *    read.
 * 3) The ioctl() method supports the commands documented below:
