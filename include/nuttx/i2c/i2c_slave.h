/****************************************************************************
 * Name: I2CS_SETOWNADDRESS
 *
 * Description:
 *   Set our own I2C address. Calling this function enables Slave mode and
 *   disables Master mode on the I2C bus (note that I2C is a bus, where
 *   multiple masters and slave may be handled by one device driver).
 *
 *   One may register a callback to be notified about reception. During the
 *   slave mode reception, the methods READ and WRITE must be used to
 *   to handle reads and writes from a master.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   dev     - Device-specific state data
 *   address - Our own slave address; If it is 0x00, then the device driver
 *             listens to general call
 *   nbits   - The number of address bits provided (7 or 10)
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK on valid address and if the same address has not been assigned
 *   to another instance sharing the same port. Otherwise ERROR is returned.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: I2CS_WRITE
 *
 * Description:
 *   Send a block of data on I2C using the previously selected I2C
 *   frequency and slave address. Each write operational will be an 'atomic'
 *   operation in the sense that any other I2C actions will be serialized
 *   and pend until this write completes. Required.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   dev    - Device-specific state data
 *   buffer - A pointer to the read-only buffer of data to be written to
 *            device
 *   buflen - The number of bytes to send from the buffer
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   0: success, <0: A negated errno
