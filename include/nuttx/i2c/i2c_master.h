 * START/STOP Rules:
 *
 * 1. The lower half I2C driver will always issue the START condition at the
 *    beginning of a message unless I2C_M_NOSTART flag is set in the
 *    message.
 *
 * 2. The lower half I2C driver will always issue the STOP condition at the
 *    end of the messages unless:
 *
 *    a. The I2C_M_NOSTOP flag is set in the message, OR
 *    b. The following message has the I2C_M_NOSTART flag set (meaning
 *       that following message is simply a continuation of the transfer).
 *
 * A proper I2C repeated start would then have I2C_M_NOSTOP set on msg[n]
 * and I2C_M_NOSTART *not* set on msg[n+1].  See the following table:
 *
 *   msg[n].flags  msg[n+1].flags Behavior
 *   ------------ --------------- -----------------------------------------
 *   0            0                Two normal, separate messages with STOP
 *                                 on msg[n] then START on msg[n+1]
 *   0*           I2C_M_NOSTART    Continuation of the same transfer (must
 *                                 be the same direction).  See NOTE below.
 *   NO_STOP      0                No STOP on msg[n]; repeated START on
 *                                 msg[n+1].

 *   count - The number of transfers to perform
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) or positive on success; a negated errno value on failure.
 *
 *   Note : some implementations of this interface return the number of
