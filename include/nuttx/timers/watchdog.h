/* IOCTL Commands ***********************************************************/
/* The watchdog driver uses a standard character driver framework.  However,
 * since the watchdog driver is a device control interface and not a data
 * transfer interface, the majority of the functionality is implemented in
 * driver ioctl calls.  The watchdog ioctl commands are lised below:
 *
 * These are detected and handled by the "upper half" watchdog timer driver.
 *
 * WDIOC_START      - Start the watchdog timer
 *                    Argument: Ignored
 * WDIOC_STOP       - Stop the watchdog timer
 *                    Argument: Ignored
 * WDIOC_GETSTATUS  - Get the status of the watchdog timer.
 *                    Argument:  A writeable pointer to struct watchdog_status_s.
 * WDIOC_SETTIMEOUT - Reset the watchdog timeout to this value
 *                    Argument: A 32-bit timeout value in milliseconds.
 * WDIOC_CAPTURE    - Do not reset.  Instead, called this handler.
 *                    Argument: A pointer to struct watchdog_capture_s.
 * WDIOC_KEEPALIVE  - Reset the watchdog timer ("ping", "pet the dog");
 *                    Argument: Ignored
 *
 * These may be supported by certain "lower half" drivers
 *
 * WDIOC_MINTIME    - Set the minimum ping time.  If two keepalive ioctls
 *                    are received within this time, a reset event will
 *                    be generated.  This feature should assume to be
 *                    disabled after WDIOC_SETTIMEOUT.
 *                    Argument: A 32-bit time value in milliseconds.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: watchdog_register
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function binds an instance of a "lower half" watchdog driver with the
 *   "upper half" watchdog device and registers that device so that can be used
 *   by application code.
 *
 *   When this function is called, the "lower half" driver should be in the
 *   disabled state (as if the stop() method had already been called).
 *
 *   NOTE:  This function would not be called by application code.  Rather it is
 *   called indirectly through the architecture-specific interfaces.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   dev path - The full path to the driver to be registers in the NuttX
 *     pseudo-filesystem.  The recommended convention is to name all watchdog
 *     drivers as "/dev/watchdog0", "/dev/watchdog1", etc.  where the driver
 *     path differs only in the "minor" number at the end of the device name.
 *   lower - A pointer to an instance of lower half watchdog driver.  This
 *     instance is bound to the watchdog driver and must persists as long as
 *     the driver persists.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, a non-NULL handle is returned to the caller.  In the event
 *   of any failure, a NULL value is returned.
