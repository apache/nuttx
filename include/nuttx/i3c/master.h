 *        This method is mandatory.
 * @bus_cleanup: cleanup everything done in
 *       &i3c_master_controller_ops->bus_init().
 *       This method is optional.
 * @attach_i3c_dev: called every time an I3C device is attached to the bus.
 *        It can be after a DAA or when a device is statically declared
 *        by the FW, in which case it will only have a static address
 *        and the dynamic address will be 0.
 *        When this function is called, device information have not
 *        been retrieved yet.
 *        This is a good place to attach master controller specific
 *        data to I3C devices.
 *        This method is optional.
 * @reattach_i3c_dev: called every time an I3C device has its addressed
 *        changed. It can be because the device has been powered
 *        down and has lost its address, or it can happen when a
 *        device had a static address and has been assigned a
 *        dynamic address with SETDASA.
 *        This method is optional.
 * @detach_i3c_dev: called when an I3C device is detached from the bus.
 *        Usually happens when the master device is unregistered.
 *        This method is optional.
 * @do_daa: do a DAA (Dynamic Address Assignment) procedure. This is
 *        procedure should send an ENTDAA CCC command and then add all
 *        devices discovered sure the DAA using
 *        i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked().
 *        Add devices added with i3c_master_add_i3c_dev_locked() will then be
 *        attached or re-attached to the controller.
 *        This method is mandatory.
 * @supports_ccc_cmd: should return true if the CCC command is supported,
 *        false otherwise.
 *        This method is optional, if not provided the core assumes
 *        all CCC commands are supported.
 * @send_ccc_cmd: send a CCC command
 *        This method is mandatory.
 * @priv_xfers: do one or several private I3C SDR transfers
 *        This method is mandatory.
 * @attach_i2c_dev: called every time an I2C device is attached to the bus.
 * @detach_i2c_dev: called when an I2C device is detached from the bus.
 * @i2c_xfers: do one or several I2C transfers. Note that, unlike i3c
 *        transfers, the core does not guarantee that buffers attached to
 *        the transfers are DMA-safe. If drivers want to have DMA-safe
 *        buffers, they should use the i2c_get_dma_safe_msg_buf()
 *        and i2c_put_dma_safe_msg_buf() helpers provided by the I2C
 *        framework.
 *        This method is mandatory.
 * @request_ibi: attach an IBI handler to an I3C device. This implies
 *        defining an IBI handler and the constraints of the IBI (maximum
 *        payload length and number of pre-allocated slots).
 *        Some controllers support less IBI-capable devices than regular
 *        devices, so this method might return -%EBUSY if there's no
 *        more space for an extra IBI registration
 *        This method is optional.
 * @free_ibi: free an IBI previously requested with ->request_ibi(). The IBI
 *        should have been disabled with ->disable_irq() prior to that
 *        This method is mandatory only if ->request_ibi is not NULL.
 * @enable_ibi: enable the IBI. Only valid if ->request_ibi() has been called
 *        prior to ->enable_ibi(). The controller should first enable
 *        the IBI on the controller end (for example, unmask the hardware
 *        IRQ) and then send the ENEC CCC command (with the IBI flag set)
 *        to the I3C device.
 *        This method is mandatory only if ->request_ibi is not NULL.
 * @disable_ibi: disable an IBI. First send the DISEC CCC command with the
 *        IBI flag set and then deactivate the hardware IRQ on the
 *        controller end.
 *        This method is mandatory only if ->request_ibi is not NULL.
 * @recycle_ibi_slot: recycle an IBI slot. Called every time an IBI has been
 *        processed by its handler. The IBI slot should be put back
 *        in the IBI slot pool so that the controller can re-use it
 *        for a future IBI
 *        This method is mandatory only if ->request_ibi is not
