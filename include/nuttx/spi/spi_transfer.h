 * Description:
 *   This is a helper function that can be used to encapsulate and manage

 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   spi - An instance of the SPI device to use for the transfer
 *   seq - Describes the sequence of transfers.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) on success; a negated errno value on failure.

 * Name: spi_register
 *
 * Description:
 *   Create and register the SPI character driver.
 *
 *   The SPI character driver is a simple character driver that supports SPI
 *   transfers.  The intent of this driver is to support SPI testing.  It is
 *   not suitable for use in any real driver application.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   spi - An instance of the lower half SPI driver
 *   bus - The SPI bus number.  This will be used as the SPI device minor
 *     number.  The SPI character device will be registered as /dev/spiN
 *     where N is the minor number
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   OK if the driver was successfully register; A negated errno value is
 *   returned on any failure.
