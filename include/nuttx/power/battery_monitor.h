/* Configuration ************************************************************/

/* CONFIG_BATTERY_MONITOR - Upper half battery monitor driver support
 *
 * Specific, lower-half drivers will have other configuration requirements
 * such as:
 *
 *   CONFIG_I2C - I2C support *may* be needed
 *   CONFIG_I2C_BQ769X0 - The BQ769X0 driver must be explicitly selected.
 */

/* IOCTL Commands ***********************************************************/

/* The upper-half battery monitor driver provides a character driver
 * "wrapper" around the lower-half battery monitor driver that does all of
 * the real work. Since there is no real data transfer to/or from a battery,
 * all of the driver interaction is through IOCTL commands.  The IOCTL
 * commands supported by the upper-half driver simply provide calls into the
 * lower half as summarized below:
 *
 * BATIOC_STATE - Return the current state of the battery (see
 *   enum battery_monitor_status_e).
 *   Input value:  A pointer to type int.
 * BATIOC_HEALTH - Return the current health of the battery (see
 *   enum battery_monitor_health_e).
 *   Input value:  A pointer to type int.
 * BATIOC_ONLINE - Return 1 if the battery is online; 0 if offline.
 *   Input value:  A pointer to type bool.
 * BATIOC_VOLTAGE - Return the current battery pack voltage in microvolts.
 *   Input value:  A pointer to type int.
 * BATIOC_CELLVOLTAGE - Return the voltage of all cells in microvolts.
 *   Input value:  A pointer to type battery_monitor_voltage_s.
 * BATIOC_CURRENT - Return the current battery pack current in microamps.
 *   The returned data includes duration over which measurement was done, if
 *   provided by the hardware.
 *   Input value:  A pointer to type battery_monitor_current_s.
 * BATIOC_SOC - Return the state-of-charge of the battery, in percent.
 *   Input value:  A pointer to type b16_t.
 * BATIOC_COULOMBS - Return the value of the monitor's coulomb counter,
 *   if provided by the hardware
 *   Input value:  A pointer to type int.
 * BATIOC_TEMPERATURE - Return the value of any temperature sensors attached
 *   to the monitor, in microvolts.
 *   Input value:  A pointer to type battery_monitor_temperature_s.
 * BATIOC_BALANCE - Set the monitor's battery balancing switches.
 *   Input value:  A pointer to type battery_monitor_balance_s.
 * BATIOC_SHUTDOWN - Put the device into low-power shutdown mode.
 *   Input value:  None.
 * BATIOC_SETLIMITS - Set the device's safety limits for voltage, current,
 *   etc.
 *   Input value:  A pointer to type battery_monitor_limits_s.
 * BATIOC_CHGDSG - Set the device's charge and discharge switches.
 *   Input value:  A pointer to type battery_monitor_switches_s.
 * BATIOC_CLEARFAULTS - Clear the device's most recent fault.
 *   Input value:  None.
 * BATIOC_OPERATE - Perform miscellaneous, device-specific charger operation.
 *   Input value:  An uintptr_t that can hold a pointer to struct
 *   batio_operate_msg_s.

 * Name: BQ769X0_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   Initialize the BQ769X0 battery driver and return an instance of the

 *
 * This is for:
 *   BQ7692000XXX
 *   BQ7693000XXX
 *   bq7694000XXX
 *
 *   This driver requires:
 *
 *   CONFIG_BATTERY_MONITOR - Upper half battery monitor driver support
 *   CONFIG_I2C - I2C support
 *   CONFIG_I2C_BQ769X0 - And the driver must be explicitly selected.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   i2c       - An instance of the I2C interface to use to communicate with
 *               the BQ769X0
 *   addr      - The I2C address of the BQ769X0 (Can be 0x08 or 0x18).
 *   frequency - The I2C frequency
 *   crc       - True if the device has CRC enabled (see TI datasheet)
 *   cellcount - The number of battery cells attached to the BQ769X0.  The
 *               mapping of the cells changes based on count - see datasheet.
 *   chip      - The chip type (either CHIP_BQ76920, CHIP_BQ76930, or
 *               CHIP_BQ76940).  This is used to map cell numbers when the
 *               full capacity of the chip is not used.  See the TI datasheet
 *               for cell wiring information.
 *   sense_r   - The value of the current sense resistor, in micro ohms.
 *               This value is used to calculate reported current, and when
 *               setting overcurrent thresholds.
 * Returned Value:
 *   A pointer to the initialized battery driver instance.  A NULL pointer
 *   is returned on a failure to initialize the BQ769X0 lower half.
