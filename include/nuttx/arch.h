/* This header file contains function prototypes for the interfaces between
 * (1) the nuttx core-code, (2) the microprocessor specific logic that
 * resides under the arch/ sub-directory, and (3) the board-specific logic
 * that resides under boards/
 *
 * Naming conventions:
 *
 * 1. Common Microprocessor Interfaces.
 *
 *    Any interface that is common across all microprocessors should be
 *    prefixed with up_ and prototyped in this header file. These
 *    definitions provide the common interface between NuttX and the
 *    architecture-specific implementation in arch/
 *
 *    This chip related declarations are retained in this header file.
 *
 *    NOTE: up_ is supposed to stand for microprocessor; the u is like the
 *    Greek letter micron.
 *
 * 2. Microprocessor-Specific Interfaces.
 *
 *    An interface which is unique to a certain microprocessor should be
 *    prefixed with the name of the microprocessor, for example stm32_,
 *    and be prototyped in some header file in the arch/ directories.
 *
 *    There is also a arch/<architecture>/include/<chip>/chip.h header file
 *    that can be used to communicate other microprocessor-specific
 *    information between the board logic and even application logic.
 *    Application logic may, for example, need to know specific capabilities
 *    of the chip.  Prototypes in that chip.h header file should follow the
 *    microprocessor specific naming convention.
 *
 * 3. Common Board Interfaces.
 *
 *    Any interface that is common across all boards should be prefixed
 *    with board_ and should be prototyped in the board.h header file.
 *    These board_ definitions provide the interface between the board-level
 *    logic and the architecture-specific logic.
 *
 * 4. Board-Specific Interfaces.
 *
 *    Any interface that is unique to a board should be prefixed with
 *    the board name, for example stm32f4discovery_.  Sometimes the board
 *    name is too long so stm32_ would be okay too.  These should be
 *    prototyped in boards/<arch>/<chip><board>/src/<board>.h and should
 *    not be used outside of that board directory since board-specific
 *    definitions have no meaning outside of the board directory.

 * Address Environment Interfaces
 *
 * Low-level interfaces used in binfmt/ to instantiate tasks with address
 * environments.  These interfaces all operate on type group_addrenv_t which
 * is an abstract representation of a task group's address environment and
 * must be defined in arch/arch.h if CONFIG_ARCH_ADDRENV is defined.
 *
 *   up_addrenv_create   - Create an address environment
 *   up_addrenv_destroy  - Destroy an address environment.
 *   up_addrenv_vtext    - Returns the virtual base address of the .text
 *                         address environment
 *   up_addrenv_vdata    - Returns the virtual base address of the .bss/.data
 *                         address environment
 *   up_addrenv_heapsize - Returns the size of the initial heap allocation.
 *   up_addrenv_select   - Instantiate an address environment
 *   up_addrenv_restore  - Restore an address environment
 *   up_addrenv_clone    - Copy an address environment from one location to
 *                         another.
 *
 * Higher-level interfaces used by the tasking logic.  These interfaces are
 * used by the functions in sched/ and all operate on the thread which whose
 * group been assigned an address environment by up_addrenv_clone().
 *
 *   up_addrenv_attach   - Clone the address environment assigned to one TCB
 *                         to another.  This operation is done when a pthread
 *                         is created that share's the same address
 *                         environment.
 *   up_addrenv_detach   - Release the threads reference to an address
 *                         environment when a task/thread exits.
 *
 * CONFIG_ARCH_STACK_DYNAMIC=y indicates that the user process stack resides
 * in its own address space.  This options is also *required* if
 * CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL and CONFIG_LIBC_EXECFUNCS are selected.  Why?
 * Because the caller's stack must be preserved in its own address space
 * when we instantiate the environment of the new process in order to
 * initialize it.
 *
 * NOTE: The naming of the CONFIG_ARCH_STACK_DYNAMIC selection implies that
 * dynamic stack allocation is supported.  Certainly this option must be set
 * if dynamic stack allocation is supported by a platform.  But the more
 * general meaning of this configuration environment is simply that the
 * stack has its own address space.
 *
 * If CONFIG_ARCH_STACK_DYNAMIC=y is selected then the platform specific
 * code must export these additional interfaces:
 *
 *   up_addrenv_ustackalloc  - Create a stack address environment
 *   up_addrenv_ustackfree   - Destroy a stack address environment.
 *   up_addrenv_vustack      - Returns the virtual base address of the stack
 *   up_addrenv_ustackselect - Instantiate a stack address environment
 *
 * If CONFIG_ARCH_KERNEL_STACK is selected, then each user process will have
 * two stacks:  (1) a large (and possibly dynamic) user stack and (2) a
 * smaller kernel stack.  However, this option is *required* if both
 * CONFIG_BUILD_KERNEL and CONFIG_LIBC_EXECFUNCS are selected.  Why?  Because
 * when we instantiate and initialize the address environment of the new
 * user process, we will temporarily lose the address environment of the old
 * user process, including its stack contents.  The kernel C logic will crash
 * immediately with no valid stack in place.
 *
 * If CONFIG_ARCH_KERNEL_STACK=y is selected then the platform specific
 * code must export these additional interfaces:
 *
 *   up_addrenv_kstackalloc  - Create a stack in the kernel address
 *                             environment
 *   up_addrenv_kstackfree   - Destroy the kernel stack.

 *   all normal tasks, pthreads, and kernel threads for all CPUs.
 *
 *   The initial IDLE task is a special case because the CPUs can be started
 *   in different wans in different environments:
 *
 *   1. The CPU may already have been started and waiting in a low power
 *      state for up_cpu_start().  In this case, the IDLE thread's stack
 *      has already been allocated and is already in use.  Here
 *      up_cpu_idlestack() only has to provide information about the
 *      already allocated stack.
 *
 *   2. The CPU may be disabled but started when up_cpu_start() is called.
 *      In this case, a new stack will need to be created for the IDLE
 *      thread and this function is then equivalent to:
 *
 *      return up_create_stack(tcb, stack_size, TCB_FLAG_TTYPE_KERNEL);
 *
 *   The following TCB fields must be initialized by this function:

 *   - adj_stack_size: Stack size after adjustment for hardware, processor,
 *     etc.  This value is retained only for debug purposes.
 *   - stack_alloc_ptr: Pointer to allocated stack
 *   - adj_stack_ptr: Adjusted stack_alloc_ptr for HW.  The initial value of

 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   - cpu:         CPU index that indicates which CPU the IDLE task is
 *                  being created for.
 *   - tcb:         The TCB of new CPU IDLE task
 *   - stack_size:  The requested stack size for the IDLE task.  At least

 *   In Harvard architectures, data accesses and instruction accesses occur

 *   used to read data from the instruction address space.  Also, in the
 *   typical MCU, the available SRAM data memory is much smaller that the
 *   non-volatile FLASH instruction memory.  So if the application requires
 *   many constant strings, the only practical solution may be to store
 *   those constant strings in FLASH memory where they can only be accessed
 *   using architecture-specific machine instructions.
 *
 *   A similar case is where strings are retained in "external" memory such
 *   as EEPROM or serial FLASH.  This case is similar only in that again
 *   special operations are required to obtain the string data; it cannot
 *   be accessed directly from a string pointer.
 *
 *   If CONFIG_ARCH_ROMGETC is defined, then the architecture logic must
 *   export the function up_romgetc().  up_romgetc() will simply read one
 *   byte of data from the instruction space.
 *

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: up_rtc_getdatetime_with_subseconds
 *
 * Description:
 *   Get the current date and time from the date/time RTC.  This interface
 *   is only supported by the date/time RTC hardware implementation.
 *   It is used to replace the system timer.  It is only used by the RTOS
 *   during initialization to set up the system time when CONFIG_RTC and
 *   CONFIG_RTC_DATETIME are selected (and CONFIG_RTC_HIRES is not).
 *
 *   NOTE: This interface exposes sub-second accuracy capability of RTC
 *   hardware. This interface allow maintaining timing accuracy when system
 *   time needs constant resynchronization with RTC, for example on MCU with
 *   low-power state that stop system timer.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   tp - The location to return the high resolution time value.
 *   nsec - The location to return the subsecond time value.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) on success; a negated errno on failure

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: arch_phy_irq
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function may be called to register an interrupt handler that will
 *   be called when a PHY interrupt occurs.  This function both attaches
 *   the interrupt handler and enables the interrupt if 'handler' is non-
 *   NULL.  If handler is NULL, then the interrupt is detached and disabled
 *   instead.
 *
 *   The PHY interrupt is always disabled upon return.  The caller must
 *   call back through the enable function point to control the state of
 *   the interrupt.
 *
 *   This interrupt may or may not be available on a given platform depending
 *   on how the network hardware architecture is implemented.  In a typical
 *   case, the PHY interrupt is provided to board-level logic as a GPIO
 *   interrupt (in which case this is a board-specific interface and really
 *   should be called board_phy_irq()); In other cases, the PHY interrupt
 *   may be cause by the chip's MAC logic (in which case arch_phy_irq()) is
 *   an appropriate name.  Other other boards, there may be no PHY interrupts
 *   available at all.  If client attachable PHY interrupts are available
 *   from the board or from the chip, then CONFIG_ARCH_PHY_INTERRUPT should
 *   be defined to indicate that fact.
 *
 *   Typical usage:
 *   a. OS service logic (not application logic*) attaches to the PHY
 *      PHY interrupt and enables the PHY interrupt.
 *   b. When the PHY interrupt occurs:  (1) the interrupt should be
 *      disabled and () work should be scheduled on the worker thread (or
 *      perhaps a dedicated application thread).
 *   c. That worker thread should use the SIOCGMIIPHY, SIOCGMIIREG,
 *      and SIOCSMIIREG ioctl calls** to communicate with the PHY,
 *      determine what network event took place (Link Up/Down?), and
 *      take the appropriate actions.
 *   d. It should then interact the PHY to clear any pending
 *      interrupts, then re-enable the PHY interrupt.
 *
 *    * This is an OS internal interface and should not be used from
 *      application space.  Rather applications should use the SIOCMIISIG
 *      ioctl to receive a signal when a PHY event occurs.
 *   ** This interrupt is really of no use if the Ethernet MAC driver
 *      does not support these ioctl calls.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   intf    - Identifies the network interface.  For example "eth0".  Only
 *             useful on platforms that support multiple Ethernet interfaces
 *             and, hence, multiple PHYs and PHY interrupts.
 *   handler - The client interrupt handler to be invoked when the PHY
 *             asserts an interrupt.  Must reside in OS space, but can
 *             signal tasks in user space.  A value of NULL can be passed
 *             in order to detach and disable the PHY interrupt.
 *   arg     - The argument that will accompany the interrupt
 *   enable  - A function pointer that be unused to enable or disable the
 *             PHY interrupt.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero (OK) returned on success; a negated errno value is returned on
 *   failure.
