/* Mount flags */

#define MS_RDONLY 1 /* Mount file system read-only */

/* Un-mount flags
 *
 * These flags control the behavior of umount2() when there are open file
 * references through the mountpoint.  umount2() with no flag bits set is
 * equivalent to umount(), i.e., the umount() will fail with EBUSY if there
 * are open references on the file.
 *
 *   MNT_FORCE - Force unmount even if busy. This can cause data loss.
 *   MNT_DETACH - Perform a lazy unmount: make the mount point unavailable
 *     for new accesses, and actually perform the unmount when the mount
 *     point ceases to be busy.
 *   MNT_EXPIRE - Mark the mount point as expired. If a mount point is not
 *     currently in use, then an initial call to umount2() with this flag
 *     fails with the error EAGAIN, but marks the mount point as expired. The
 *     mount point remains expired as long as it isn't accessed by any
 *     process. A second umount2() call specifying MNT_EXPIRE unmounts an
 *     expired mount point. This flag cannot be specified with either
 *     MNT_FORCE or MNT_DETACH.
 *  UMOUNT_NOFOLLOW (- Don't dereference target if it is a symbolic link.
 *     For Linux, this flag allows security problems to be avoided in
 *     set-user-ID-root programs that allow unprivileged users to unmount
 *     file systems.  For NuttX, it is provided only for compatibility
 *
 * Not all options are supported on all file systems.
