/****************************************************************************
 * Name: adjtime
 *
 * Description:
 *   The adjtime() function gradually adjusts the system clock (as returned
 *   by gettimeofday(2)).  The amount of time by which the clock is to be
 *   adjusted is specified in the structure pointed to by delta.
 *
 *   This structure has the following form:
 *
 *     struct timeval
 *       {
 *         time_t      tv_sec;     (seconds)
 *         suseconds_t tv_usec;    (microseconds)
 *       };
 *
 *   If the adjustment in delta is positive, then the system clock is
 *   speeded up by some small percentage (i.e., by adding a small amount of
 *   time to the clock value in each second) until the adjustment has been
 *   completed.  If the adjustment in delta is negative, then the clock is
 *   slowed down in a similar fashion.
 *
 *   If a clock adjustment from an earlier adjtime() call is already in
 *   progress at the time of a later adjtime() call, and delta is not NULL
 *   for the later call, then the earlier adjustment is stopped, but any
 *   already completed part of that adjustment is not undone.
 *
 *   If olddelta is not NULL, then the buffer that it points to is used to
 *   return the amount of time remaining from any previous adjustment that
 *   has not yet been completed.
 *
 *   NOTE: This is not a POSIX interface but derives from 4.3BSD, System V.
 *   It is also supported for Linux compatibility.

 * Name: getitimer
 *
 * Description:
 *   The getitimer() function will store the amount of time until the

 *   into the space pointed to by the value argument. The it_value member
 *   of this structure will contain the amount of time before the timer
 *   expires, or zero if the timer is disarmed. This value is returned as
 *   the interval until timer expiration. The it_interval member of value
 *   will contain the reload value last set by setitime().
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   which - The predefined timer id
 *   value - The current timer value
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   If the getitimer() succeeds, a value of 0 (OK) will be returned.
 *   If an error occurs, the value -1 (ERROR) will be returned, and errno
 *   set to indicate the error.
 *
 *   EINVAL - The which argument does not correspond to an predefined ID.
 *
 * Assumptions/Limitations:
 *   Due to the asynchronous operation of this function, the time reported
 *   by this function could be significantly more than that actual time
 *   remaining on the timer at any time.

 * Name: setitimer
 *
 * Description:
 *   The setitimer() function sets the time until the next expiration of
 *   the timer specified by which from the it_value member of the value
 *   argument and arm the timer if the it_value member of value is non-zero.
 *   If the specified timer was already armed when setitimer() is
 *   called, this call will reset the time until next expiration to the
 *   value specified. If the it_value member of value is zero, the timer
 *   will be disarmed. The effect of disarming or resetting a timer with
 *   pending expiration notifications is unspecified.
 *
 *   The reload value of the timer will be set to the value specified by the
 *   it_interval member of value.  When a timer is armed with a non-zero
 *   it_interval, a periodic (or repetitive) timer is specified.
 *
 *   Time values that are between two consecutive non-negative integer
 *   multiples of the resolution of the specified timer will be rounded up
 *   to the larger multiple of the resolution. Quantization error will not
 *   cause the timer to expire earlier than the rounded time value.
 *
 *   If the argument ovalue is not NULL, the setitimer() function will
 *   store, in the location referenced by ovalue, a value representing the
 *   previous amount of time before the timer would have expired, or zero if
 *   the timer was disarmed, together with the previous timer reload value.
 *   Timers will not expire before their scheduled time.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   which - The predefined timer id
 *   value - Specifies the timer value to set
 *   ovalue - A location in which to return the time remaining from the
 *     previous timer setting.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   If the setitimer() succeeds, a value of 0 (OK) will be returned.
 *   If an error occurs, the value -1 (ERROR) will be returned, and errno set
 *   to indicate the error.
 *
 *   EINVAL - The which argument does not correspond to an predefined ID.
 *   EINVAL - A value structure specified a microsecond value less than zero
 *     or greater than or equal to 1000 million, and the it_value member of
 *     that structure did not specify zero seconds and nanoseconds.

 * Name: utimes

 * Description:
 *   The utimes() function shall set the access and modification times of

 *
 *   For utimes(), the times argument is an array of timeval structures.
 *   The first array member represents the date and time of last access,
 *   and the second member represents the date and time of last
 *   modification. The times in the timeval structure are measured in
 *   seconds and microseconds since the Epoch, although rounding toward
 *   the nearest second may occur.
 *
 *   If the times argument is a null pointer, the access and modification
 *   times of the file shall be set to the current time. The effective
 *   user ID of the process shall match the owner of the file, has write
 *   access to the file or appropriate privileges to use this call in this
 *   manner. Upon completion, utimes() shall mark the time of the last
 *   file status change, st_ctime, for update.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   path  - Specifies the file to be modified
 *   times - Specifies the time value to set
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1 shall
 *   be returned and errno shall be set to indicate the error, and the file
