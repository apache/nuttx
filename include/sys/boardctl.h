/* Common commands
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_INIT
 * DESCRIPTION:   Perform one-time application initialization.
 * ARG:           The boardctl() argument is passed to the
 *                board_app_initialize() implementation without modification.
 *                The argument has no meaning to NuttX; the meaning of the
 *                argument is a contract between the board-specific
 *                initialization logic and the matching application logic.
 *                The value could be such things as a mode enumeration value,
 *                a set of DIP switch switch settings, a pointer to
 *                configuration data read from a file or serial FLASH, or
 *                whatever you would like to do with it.  Every
 *                implementation should accept zero/NULL as a default
 *                configuration.
 * CONFIGURATION: CONFIG_BOARDCTL
 * DEPENDENCIES:  Board logic must provide board_app_initialize()
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_POWEROFF
 * DESCRIPTION:   Power off the board
 * ARG:           Integer value providing power off status information
 * CONFIGURATION: CONFIG_BOARDCTL_POWEROFF
 * DEPENDENCIES:  Board logic must provide the board_power_off() interface.
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_RESET
 * DESCRIPTION:   Reset the board
 * ARG:           Integer value providing power off status information
 * CONFIGURATION: CONFIG_BOARDCTL_RESET
 * DEPENDENCIES:  Board logic must provide the board_reset() interface.
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_PM_CONTROL
 * DESCRIPTION:   Manage power state transition and query
 * ARG:           A pointer to an instance of struct boardioc_pm_ctrl_s
 * CONFIGURATION: CONFIG_PM
 * DEPENDENCIES:  None
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_UNIQUEID
 * DESCRIPTION:   Return a unique ID associated with the board (such as a
 *                serial number or a MAC address).
 * ARG:           A writable array of size CONFIG_BOARDCTL_UNIQUEID_SIZE in
 *                which to receive the board unique ID.
 * DEPENDENCIES:  Board logic must provide the board_uniqueid() interface.
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_MKRD
 * DESCRIPTION:   Create a RAM disk
 * ARG:           Pointer to read-only instance of struct boardioc_mkrd_s.
 * CONFIGURATION: CONFIG_BOARDCTL_MKRD
 * DEPENDENCIES:  None
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_ROMDISK
 * DESCRIPTION:   Register a ROM disk
 * ARG:           Pointer to read-only instance of struct boardioc_romdisk_s.
 * CONFIGURATION: CONFIG_BOARDCTL_ROMDISK
 * DEPENDENCIES:  None
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_APP_SYMTAB
 * DESCRIPTION:   Select the application symbol table.  This symbol table
 *                provides the symbol definitions exported to application
 *                code from application space.
 * ARG:           A pointer to an instance of struct boardioc_symtab_s
 * CONFIGURATION: CONFIG_BOARDCTL_APP_SYMTAB
 * DEPENDENCIES:  None
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_OS_SYMTAB
 * DESCRIPTION:   Select the OS symbol table.  This symbol table provides
 *                the symbol definitions exported by the OS to kernel
 *                modules.
 * ARG:           A pointer to an instance of struct boardioc_symtab_s
 * CONFIGURATION: CONFIG_BOARDCTL_OS_SYMTAB
 * DEPENDENCIES:  None
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_BUILTINS
 * DESCRIPTION:   Provide the user-space list of built-in applications for
 *                use by BINFS in protected mode.  Normally this is small
 *                set of globals provided by user-space logic.  It provides
 *                name-value pairs for associating built-in application
 *                names with user-space entry point addresses.  These
 *                globals are only needed for use by BINFS which executes
 *                built-in applications from kernel-space in PROTECTED mode.
 *                In the FLAT build, the user space globals are readily
 *                available.  (BINFS is not supportable in KERNEL mode since
 *                user-space address have no general meaning that
 *                configuration).
 * ARG:           A pointer to an instance of struct boardioc_builtin_s
 * CONFIGURATION: This BOARDIOC command is always available when
 *                CONFIG_BUILTIN is enabled, but does nothing unless
 *                CONFIG_BUILD_PROTECTED is also selected.
 * DEPENDENCIES:  None
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_USBDEV_CONTROL
 * DESCRIPTION:   Manage USB device classes
 * ARG:           A pointer to an instance of struct boardioc_usbdev_ctrl_s

 *                boardioc_nxterm_create_s
 * CONFIGURATION: CONFIG_NXTERM
 * DEPENDENCIES:  Base NX terminal logic provides nx_register() and
 *                nxtk_register()
 *
 * CMD:           BOARDIOC_NXTERM_IOCTL
 * DESCRIPTION:   Create an NX terminal IOCTL command.  Normal IOCTLs
 *                cannot be be performed in most graphics contexts since
 *                the depend on the task holding an open file descriptor
 * ARG:           A reference readable/writable instance of struct
 *                boardioc_nxterm_ioctl_s

 * Name: boardctl
 *
 * Description:
 *   In a small embedded system, there will typically be a much greater
 *   interaction between application and low-level board features.  The
 *   canonically correct to implement such interactions is by implementing a
 *   character driver and performing the interactions via low level ioctl
 *   calls.  This, however, may not be practical in many cases and will lead
 *   to "correct" but awkward implementations.
 *
 *   boardctl() is non-standard OS interface to alleviate the problem.
 *   It basically circumvents the normal device driver ioctl interlace and
 *   allows the application to perform direct IOCTL-like calls to the
 *   board-specific logic.
 *   It is especially useful for setting up board operational and test
 *   configurations.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   cmd - Identifies the board command to be executed
 *   arg - The argument that accompanies the command.  The nature of the
 *         argument is determined by the specific command.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success zero (OK) is returned; -1 (ERROR) is returned on failure
 *   with the errno variable set to indicate the nature of the failure.
