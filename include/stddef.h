/* The <stddef.h> header shall define the following types:
 *
 * ptrdiff_t
 *   Signed integer type of the result of subtracting two pointers.
 *
 * wchar_t
 *   Integer type whose range of values can represent distinct wide-character
 *   codes for all members of the largest character set specified among the
 *   locales supported by the compilation environment: the null character has
 *   the code value 0 and each member of the portable character set has a
 *   code value equal to its value when used as the lone character in an
 *   integer character constant.
 *
 * size_t
 *   Unsigned integer type of the result of the sizeof operator.
 *
 * NOTE: Currently the type definitions of ptrdiff_t, wchar_t, and size_t are
 *     in sys/types.h but should be moved here sometime.
 *
 * The implementation shall support one or more programming environments in
 * which the widths of ptrdiff_t, size_t, and wchar_t are no greater than the
 * width of type long. The names of these programming environments can be
 * obtained using the confstr() function or the getconf utility.
